What are the historical implications of the Trump/Kim Summit as it relates to denuclearization and the halting of joint-military exercises?
This morning it was announced that Kim Jung-Un would commit to ["complete denuclearization"](https://nypost.com/2018/06/12/kim-jong-un-commits-to-complete-denuclearization-of-the-korean-peninsula-document/) as part of a joint-document he signed with Donald Trump. In return, the United States would halt [joint-military exercises with South Korea](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/12/world/asia/trump-military-exercises-north-south-korea.html). It should be mentioned that Kim had [already pledged denuclearization](https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/04/27/606264786/peace-at-hand-korean-leaders-meet-for-historic-border-handshake) back in April with a meeting with South Korea's leader.

As a result, many people have pointed out that historically, [Kim has made similar pledges but backed out on them.](https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/09/asia/north-korean-denuclearization-promises/index.html) 

I have several questions as it relates to this summit.

1) What makes this pledge from Kim different from previous pledges?

2) If Kim backs out on his pledge, and we no longer have troops in South Korea, what are our options from a geopolitical standpoint?

3) Is the document signed by Kim and Trump a document of substance, or a document for the media? Is there anything binding in that document that holds each nation to it's pledges?
