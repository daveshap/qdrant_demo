PRICE: Just one little thing. How come you were so sure Manfredi and Johnson wouldn't get out of the forest?

SEFTON: And what's that crack supposed to mean?
PRICE: They're lying dead in the mud out there and I'm trying to find out how come.
SEFTON: I'll tell you how come. The Barrack Chief gave them the green light. And you, our Security Officer, said it'd be safe. That's how come.
