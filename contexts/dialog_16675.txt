QUINCY: Don't put your hands in your pockets, hold your head up, always look a man in the eye, and all the time I'm hanging on his every word like he's God or something...
MONICA: I know he messed up, but that doesn't change what he's been to you.
QUINCY: What has he been to me? I mean, he looked me in my face and lied like it was nothing. Like it was easy. And I'm standing there getting loud on my mom like she's the one with no sense...
MONICA: She understands.
QUINCY: He even had me wanting to play for the Clippers." Man
MONICA: You're not stupid.
QUINCY: I know a lot of brothers dog their wives, I just never thought my pops would do some shit like this...
MONICA: Nothing. Why don't we walk to my dorm?
QUINCY: I'm not up for running into anybody. Let's just kick it here, alright?
MONICA: I...can't.
QUINCY: Why not?
MONICA: Coach has us on eleven o'clock curfew. If I'm late, I don't suit up.
QUINCY: Didn't realize you were watching the clock.
MONICA: I mean, I can stay a few more minutes.
QUINCY: Nah. Don't sweat it.
MONICA: Quincy...
QUINCY: For real. I should be alone, anyway.
