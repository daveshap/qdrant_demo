I need help.
Hello, I’m asking for help because I’m truly at my last straw. I live in a family of 5, my parent my 2 sisters and me. My older sister is very abusive. She is 7 years older than me(im 14). She often screams at me for existing saying “they should’ve aborted you, you fat wh***” and sometimes she goes psychotic and destroys stuff in my room e.g rips my notebooks, spills all my lotions on my desk etc. At this point I’m scared to go home after school, so I signed up for extracurriculars that as long as 1-3 hours everyday. I told my mom about it and she said she would speak to her about it; it’s been a month since and her aggression towards me continues. Please help me, i shouldn’t be scared to come to my own home.
