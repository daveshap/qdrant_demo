Grad school for Neural network science
Graduate school for Neural network science


Hey y’all, hope y’all are social distancing and washing your hands,

I am currently a rising senior with completing a degree in Informatics. I am also developing my career and trying to get into neural network science. I have been working in my mentors lab analyzing neural networks from patients since my sophomore year. I have a good amount of python knowledge under my belt, but in my research lab we tend to use Matlab more. I am considering grad school, but I don’t know exactly where I want to land in. Geographically, it doesn’t really matter where I go. I have been living in Indiana for my entire life, so I’m open to new experiences. Additionally, if there is someone who knows of any businesses who would pay for my grad school, I would greatly appreciate it. 

I am also working on publishing my work as we are in the process of writing up the draft for the research I have been working on. Don’t meant to brag but hopefully this will add to my selection of schools some more.
