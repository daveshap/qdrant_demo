Someone showed up 30 mins early to his Cornell interview and tried to take my time slot
like come on. I walk into Starbucks 5 mins before my interview and there’s already a kid sitting with my interviewer. The interviewer told him to get up and wait because he “came too early”. Seriously, show up at the right time don’t try and take my time spot that’s just so rude and inconsiderate, not to mention you look like a total try hard, who shows up 30 mins early for an interview, the fuck? Then my interview got cut short because the kid came so early and was waiting so long that the interviewer felt bad and ended my interview after 20 mins because “he had someone waiting for so long.” Smh.
