What does it mean when the recruiter tells me there's no interview needed and I just need to wait for a call to schedule a drug test and start date?
Title, basically. I'm rather young and very new to the hiring process, so please pardon my ignorance. I spoke with a recruiter who told me I would be well suited to a manufacturing job they were hiring for(at Tesla). I sent in my resume, and she told me that there would be no interview needed. All I was told to do was to wait for a phone call to schedule a drug test and a few emails containing forms I needed to fill out. I was told after that I would be given a start date. The job listing was also taken off the website. Does this mean I have been hired, or should I still be looking out for other jobs? It's been about a week since the call.
