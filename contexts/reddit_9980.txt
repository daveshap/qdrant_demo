What are my chances of getting an assistantship?
Hey everyone, I recently decided to take the student affairs track with 1 year left in undergrad. It’s my mission in life to help students that were like me when I started college. I’m worried that I won’t get an assistantship, and end up lost not knowing what to do after.

I have lots of residence life experience, such as being a hall council exec member, desk assistant, Resident Assistant, Residence Hall Association exec board(attended housing conferences), National Residence Hall honorary president. I did summer orientation two years in a row as well as first week orientation two years in a row. I have undergrad research experience in special education(my former field), and I’m also participating in a unique internship this coming year that involves training service dogs on campus.

For whatever it’s worth, I’m hearing impaired and can reflect on my experiences being differently abled(and helping students who are the same way, as I planned to be a speech pathologist)

Can I just get your thoughts on my experience? It’s so difficult for me to find info and to measure my chances. I like to plan ahead and feel as secure as I can. There’s a placement exchange program in the spring that I’ll go to and I also plan on applying to a couple schools outside of that that require GAs. My goal is to get into housing with full tuition waiver.
