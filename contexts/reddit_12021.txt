I don't think I can afford college this year.
Uni starts back at the end of the month. We were bad at getting financial aid the info they needed so I think that's part of why my financial aid package this year isn't enough. I could take out loans, but I have over 20k in loans already. I've sat around like a loser for almost four months, and have accomplished nothing when I could have at least been earning some money. This would be my senior year. I won't get to graduate with my friends. I know it's stupid, but 2017 is an ugly number and I don't want such an ugly number to be my graduation year.  
I have to make a decision, because I still don't have housing figured out. Or employment, health insurance, etc. Even if my dad worked 40 extra hours per month to meet the payments, last year was a real struggle. So I could end up costing him like 22k just to fail everything.  
I just want to curl up into a ball until everything goes away.
