Calling in sick gives me massive amounts of anxiety
I started a new job at the beginning of May, and everything has been going well I think. Last night I started feeling bad (i.e. swollen lymph nodes, sore throat, weak body with chills and hot flashes). I went to bed early and took some medicine and Vitamin C, dreading the morning and the fact that I may possibly have to call out. 

Well, I woke up about 45 minutes ago and still felt horrible. But I still got up, showered, shaved, and got dressed, until I finally told myself “wow I can’t do this.” I stared at boss’s phone number on my phone for a good 5 minutes before I worked up the courage to finally call him. He seemed like it was fine and told me to get better,  but my anxiety is still eating at me. 

DAE get anxiety from calling in sick? Especially since I’m new at my position, I feel like I am slacking off and my boss maybe thinks I’m lying. I also get paid hourly, so the 8 hours of work I’m missing is going to mess up my budget for the month
