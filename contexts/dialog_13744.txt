RENE: I don't know. He mentioned a city.
JOE: What is it?
RENE: Hiroshima.
JOE: Get your things.
AL: Hiroshima! She's going, with us? Are you out of your mind.
JOE: Probably.
AL: I don't trust her.
JOE: Then why let her out of our sight? Besides, she's all we've got...
JOE: You don't believe me.
RENE: Oh sure.
JOE: Then why are you smiling like that?
RENE: Lots of my clients are rich guys... They like danger..like playing with drugs and things...running around, acting mysterious.
JOE: You think I'm like that?
JOE: What's Gruner like?
RENE: They'd never talk in front of me. They'd walk away up the beach. Nervous about something.
JOE: Who was?
RENE: Ryuji and Gruner.
JOE: And Dieter.
RENE: Friend of Gruner. Just went along for the party.
JOE: And you?
RENE: It was a good job. Not many ways for a foreigner to make money here. Ryuji hires me to organize business meetings...take care of things.
