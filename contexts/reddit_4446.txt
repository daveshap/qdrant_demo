Going to a therapist today. Trying to get it to work this time.
Im seeing a therapist, the same one I saw for like 3 months about like 4 years ago (I was about 18 turning 19) but then I had to cancel an appointment and I couldnt bring myself to reschedule. My mom was paying for it and she was never the biggest believer in my mental illness. There was a lot of pressure to drop out of therapy (common theme) and I was too scared to say what I really wanted to say. 

I was also getting out of a horribly abuse relationship with a pedophile that had groomed me since I was 13. I wasnt even aware it was abuse yet. I never talked to her about it. Safe to say I didnt really truly process any of that emotion healthily. 

Anyway I want to make the most out of it. I want to deal with my issues, depression very high up on that list, and I really want to stop being so afraid of that man. 

Im not sure how the etiquette of therapy works, can I just walk in and be like "Hi I have severe crippling and constant anxiety and depression also a lot of abuse and trauma Id like help with pls thank you" I dont wanna overload her by dumping it all out there but like I dont want to just talk about my week. I want actual help. 

I went back to this therapist because shes really nice and I trust her. Idk if shell even remember me. 

I want to fix my head then I believe Ill have the energy and the drive to fix my body. Right now working out and eating healthy are impossible when all I do is sleep and eat like 3 pieces of candy a day on my really bad days. 

Does anyone have any experience with therapists? I really want to make sure Im not rude or whatever by putting everything on the table the first meeting.
