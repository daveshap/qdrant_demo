BEN: Ah. Where?
BEN: Where are you meeting this person?
ELAINE: At the Zoo.
BEN: The Zoo. They have a pretty good one here, do they?
ELAINE: I've never been to it.
BEN: Oh. Well, I haven't either. I might just ride out there with you.
BEN: Is that him over there?
ELAINE: No.
BEN: Where did he say he was going to meet you?

BEN: No. I just sit in. They don't seem to mind. They've been very congenial about it.

ELAINE: -- really incredible --
