I'm losing hope in finding a job
Hey /r/studentaffairs, I've come to you once and now I'm back again. 

I'm honestly starting to lose all hope in finding a job in our field. I have tried so hard and honestly I feel like I'm getting nowhere. I don't know what I'm doing wrong or where to even start again. It's been a year since my graduation and I am the only one in my cohort without a job. I feel utterly worthless and unfulfilled. I work in food service just to pay the bills and hate it every day.

I've applied to positions in offices I used to work, tailored my resume and cover letters, networked the shit out of all my resources and still nothing. I ask interviewing committees what I can improve upon for future opportunities and get no reply. I feel so incredibly useless. No one I have talked to has had an issue like this. They've always been between jobs in the middle of their career. I have tried so hard and I feel like I'm at the end of my rope. 

I **love** the work that we do. I can't tell you what it makes me feel when I see our students succeed and achieve their greatest potential. I just can't understand why I can't do what I love.
