Evaluation interview after 3 months @ big 4 - should I tell them that I want to quit ?
Hello,

&#x200B;

I'm fresh out of college (business law bachelor degree, top 10%) and 3 months into a big 4 company as a tax consultant and I have my first evalution interview in a few days. They are going to rate my performance and I'm supposed to give them feedback and where I see my future in the company.

&#x200B;

The thing is: I hate the job. Mostly because I discovered that I hate tax (even though I'm barely doing tax law, I'm a glorified accountant right now and I hate calculating and numbers). Partly because they lied to me at the job interview about home office and flexible working. They also won't train me because the company policy prohibits this (the seniors won't get a promotion if they train new colleagues - aka wasting time). They literally just dumped me alone in another room at the end of the building away from my colleagues the first 2 weeks.

I'm looking for a new job since 2 months but it's tough if you are fresh out of college and working full time. So I'm thinking if I should tell them that I want into another department on another location which focuses more on actual law (preferably not tax) and with less numbers to calculate. This is super risky because I'm still on probation so they could easily fire me. So I'm not sure if I'm better off just to continue looking for another job? But not sure if I can sit through this.

What should I do ?

Update: I used my contacts and managed to get the contact information of our head of customs and international trade. He is willing to talk to me because they are looking for new people and this position would fit very well with my major.

So I'm calling him tomorrow. How should I handle this?
