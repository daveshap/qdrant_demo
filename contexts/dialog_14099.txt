ELLIE: I don't want to eat! And there's one more thing I don't want! Definitely! That's to see you.
ANDREWS: Know what my next move is? No more cigarettes.
ELLIE: Why don't you put me in chains?
ANDREWS: I might.

ANDREWS: Come on, Ellie. Stop being silly. You know I'm going to have my way.
ELLIE: I won't stand for it! I won't stand for your running my life! Why do you insist on it!
