Manager tried to make me choose if i wanted to fire his brother or not.
So long story short me and my manager havent been seeing eye to eye. His brother used to work for the company but quit and he decided to hire him back when our other delivery driver got fired. He told me the complete opposite of what his brother is and i absoloutely hate working with him. Last week his brother got caught smoking weed right in front of the store... Yes i know hes an idiot. The manager which again is his brother calls me into his office and tries to make me make the decision on whether or not he should escalate the problem to head office. I just straight up told him " if it was me id be fired instantly, you are the manager and this is your decision not mine". He then said he wouldnt fire me and made me write up a statement of what happened the day his brother got caught. Is this unprofessional of him and should i let the higher ups know he tried to pin it off on me? Or do i just let it go.
