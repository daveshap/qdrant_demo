Wi-Fi can\u2019t be turned on (MacBook Pro 2011, High Sierra 10.13.4) The Wi-Fi icon in the menu bar is displaying as empty. When I open Network Preferences and press \u201cTurn Wi-Fi On\u201d, nothing happens.I have tried making the Wi-Fi service inactive, deleting it, then restarting the MacBook and adding the service back. This fix actually worked, but the problem returned after about thirty minutes. Since then, I have simply been repeating the process every time the Wi-Fi turns itself off, but it is very inconvenient and I hope it is not the only fix.I\u2019m afraid that the fact that the Wi-Fi turning itself back off again indicates that it\u2019s a hardware issue.After seeing a response to another user who had a similar problem, I have also tried using Terminal to \u201ccycle the power to my wireless card\u201d. It had no effect.After restarting the MacBook again, it now says \u201cWi-Fi: No hardware installed\u201d and will not let me create a new Wi-Fi service.After another reboot I was able to turn WiFi on again, but it turned off after about ten minutes. I imagine that I will sometimes get \u201cNo Hardware Installed\u201d again in the future.
