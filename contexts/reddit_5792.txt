500+ apps, 2 interviews, no jobs. Have 3 college degrees. Slowly going crazy. What are my options?
I graduated UCLA (ranked #1 or #2 public university in the nation) in September with an MA in East Asian Studies. I also have a BS in Atmospheric Science, a BA in Asian Studies, and recently got a CAPM certification.

You'd figure with three degrees from a top school and a CAPM I would have some luck, but not at all. I've applied to everything from banks to museums to universities to tech startups.

The only 2 interviews I've had were at a university and at a car rental company.

Nevertheless, I'm at over 500 applications for which I have had 2 interviews, a 0.4% interview rate. I don't know what is average, but this interview rate is so close to 0 that it's barely even worth noting. 

I've redone my resume after every 50 or so rejections so I'm really at a loss as to what to do now.

I've read really conflicting opinions on online resume writing services, and I'm not sure if a headhunter is worth the high prices.

I went to the college career center and they said that they don't help alumni at all, so I don't really know what to do now. My mental state is slowly declining as I continue on as a 24 year old manchild at home with my parents.

 I would prefer not to work minimum wage because at that point, what was the point of spending so much money on 3 degrees? Not like I can even get an interview for minimum wage. For example, I've applied to 3 Home Depot locations on four separate occasions and never got called back.

Anyways, any sort of advice would be great. Thanks
