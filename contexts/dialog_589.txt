MOTHER MIRIAM: I'm afraid the word brings up the most unpleasant connatations in this day and age...
MARTHA: Yes... I...
MOTHER MIRIAM: You can call me Sister.
MARTHA: ... Thank you.
MOTHER MIRIAM: You must have tons of questions. You may smoke if you want to. Just don't tell any of the Sisters.
MARTHA: You were a smoker?
MOTHER MIRIAM: Two packs a day.
MARTHA: I can beat that.
MOTHER MIRIAM: Unfiltered.
MARTHA: Who knew about Agnes' pregnancy?
MOTHER MIRIAM: No-one.
MARTHA: How did she hide it from the other nuns?
MOTHER MIRIAM: She undressed alone... she bathed alone.
MARTHA: Is that normal?
MOTHER MIRIAM: Yes.
MARTHA: How did she hide it during the day?
MOTHER MIRIAM: She could have hidden a machine gun in here if she had wanted to.
MARTHA: Didn't she have any physical examinations in this time?
MOTHER MIRIAM: We're examined once a year. Her pregnancy fell in between the doctor's visits.
MARTHA: Who was the father?
MOTHER MIRIAM: I haven't a clue.
MARTHA: What man had access to her?
MOTHER MIRIAM: None as far as I know.
MARTHA: Was there a priest?
MOTHER MIRIAM: Yes, but I...
MARTHA: What's his name?
MOTHER MIRIAM: Father Martineau, but I don't see him as a candidate.
MARTHA: Could there have been anyone else?
MOTHER MIRIAM: Obviously there was.
MARTHA: And you didn't try to find out who?
MOTHER MIRIAM: Believe me, I've done everything possible short of asking Agnes.
MARTHA: Why haven't you asked her?
MOTHER MIRIAM: She can't even remember the birth. Do you think she'd admit to the conception?
MARTHA: Look, someone gave her the baby.
MOTHER MIRIAM: Yes, but that was some ten months ago. I fail to see that the identity of that somebody has anything to do with this trial.
MARTHA: Why do you think that?
MOTHER MIRIAM: Don't ask me those questions dear, I'm not the patient.
MARTHA: Well I'm the doctor. I'm the one who's going to decide what is, or is not important here.
MOTHER MIRIAM: Look doctor, I don't know how to tell you this politely, but I don't approve of you. Not you personally...
MARTHA: The science of psychiatry.
MOTHER MIRIAM: Exactly. I want you do deal with Agnes as speedily and as easily as possible. She won't hold up under any sort of cross examination.
MARTHA: I am not with the Inquisition.
MOTHER MIRIAM: And I am not from the Middle Ages. I know what you are! I don't want that mind cut open.
MARTHA: Hello. I'm Doctor Livingston. I've been asked to talk to you. May I?
AGNES: Yes.
MARTHA: You have a lovely voice.
AGNES: No I don't.
MARTHA: I just heard you.
AGNES: That wasn't me.
MARTHA: Was it Sister Marguerite?
AGNES: No I'm not.
MARTHA: Hasn't anyone ever told you that before?
AGNES: Let's talk about something else.
MARTHA: What would you like to talk about.
AGNES: I don't know.
MARTHA: Anything... may I sit down?
AGNES: Yes.
MARTHA: First thing that comes to your mind?
AGNES: God! But there's nothing to say about God.
MARTHA: Second thing that comes to your mind.
AGNES: Love.
MARTHA: Have you ever loved anyone?
AGNES: Yes.
MARTHA: Who?
AGNES: Everyone.
MARTHA: Well, who in particular?
AGNES: Right now?
MARTHA: Uh huh.
AGNES: I love you.
MARTHA: Agnes, have you ever loved another man... other than, Jesus Christ?
AGNES: Yes.
MARTHA: Who?
AGNES: Oh, there are so many.
MARTHA: Well do you love... do you love Father Martineau?
AGNES: Oh, yes!
MARTHA: Do you think he loves you?
AGNES: Oh, I know he does.
MARTHA: He's told you?
AGNES: No. But... when I look into his eyes, I can tell.
MARTHA: You've been alone together?
AGNES: Yes.
MARTHA: Often?
AGNES: At least once a week.
MARTHA: And you like that?
AGNES: Oh, yes.
MARTHA: Where do you meet?
AGNES: In the confessional.
