Proud of myself.
I miss having someone to call just to tell them about the $5 bill I just found in my pocket. Someone to kill that spider in the bathroom. Someone to cuddle and share the silence with. Someone who races over when I don’t feel well to take care of me. But I don’t miss him. I miss having someone. 

I’m proud of myself on days like today where I really want to reach out to him and tell him I miss him. But I’m not letting my mind play tricks on me. It wasn’t all sunshine and rainbows. The past is the past and he should stay there.

Stay strong to anyone out there feeling the same ❤️
