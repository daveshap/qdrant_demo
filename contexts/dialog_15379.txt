PETER: You sure you don't want to eat something?
KATHY: I don't think I could.
PETER: It's going to be a long night. It could take hours before we know something. You should try to eat.
KATHY: You sound like my mother.
PETER: It wasn't intentional.
KATHY: Does what's going on bother you at all? Or are you just wearing your game face?
PETER: I think it's interesting.
KATHY: Another kind of game?
PETER: In a way.
KATHY: This isn't a game.
PETER: Oh, but it is. He's killing a person everyday and challenging us to catch him. That's a game. It has rules and objectives.
KATHY: How can you look at it so clinically?
PETER: Take your average cop. They deal with death everyday. If they let emotions get in the way it would cloud their judgement.
KATHY: That's true -- but the emotion is still there. They just learn to control it.
PETER: What about you? Aren't there times when a young child is telling you a story so sad you just want to cry?
KATHY: Of course.
PETER: Do you?
KATHY: Let's change the subject.
PETER: Okay. So, tell me about yourself. Are you married?
