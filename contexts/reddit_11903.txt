I rub everyone the wrong way.
I'm awkward. I'm awkward in person and online. I try so hard to be polite and I let people walk all over me, yet somehow I'm always rude or abrasive or off putting. I don't say a whole lot, I speak only when spoken to, and I'm respectful. 

Yet I'm always told how annoying and rude I am.  What??
