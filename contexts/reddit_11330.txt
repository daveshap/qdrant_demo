King hit on the Gold Coast
Peoples aggressive behaviour is getting out of control.
I am typically a very placid person and not aggressive at all, so when I was at a club on the Gold Coast of Australia and was "king hit" from behind for no known reason I just couldn't believe it had happened.
I didn't know the guy, speak 2 words to him or anything so when the police asked why he did it I couldn't give them an answer.
He fractured my jaw and smashed 3 of my teeth with over 10k worth of dental work I have to pay for (which I can't afford). 
What is the go with these people? I know it might seem a little dramatic but this guy could have killed me and that is really scary.
I hear too often people dying from the same thing that happened to me.

I just don't get why
