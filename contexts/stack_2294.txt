Is there an easy way to get ether crystals for Poppi? So I've just unlocked the last form for Poppi and while it should make Tora more useful again, to really power him up will require a load of ether crystals.Is playing Tiger! Tiger! the only way to get them?If so what is the best way to get them quickly?It seems that playing the first level repeatedly is the way to go as it's easier but I'm not sure if you get more crystals in the later levels or something...
