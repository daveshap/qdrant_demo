ROMIREZ: Three days you've laid there. It's time you ate.
CONOR: This can't be.
ROMIREZ: You are not dead, boy. Accept it.
CONOR: This is monstrous. I'll burn in hell for all eternity.
ROMIREZ: You'd have to die first. Aqui.
CONOR: What is to become of me? Am I to wander the Earth forever like a ghost?
ROMIREZ: You will live. Survive.
CONOR: Then they were right. I am evil. This is God's punishment.
ROMIREZ: You have done nothing wrong Conor MacLeod.
CONOR: Oh my God. Oh my God I'm lost.
CONOR: Why does he want to kill me?
ROMIREZ: You recall how I spoke of the push you feel and how I make it less?
CONOR: Aye.
ROMIREZ: It is always less with my living. Far or near. But if I were to die the push would become stronger than ever before. There is power in this. And as long as you and I live, The Knight can never have it all.
CONOR: But we cannot be killed.
ROMIREZ: There is an imperfection. For all your healing, if your head ever leaves your neck, you are dead. You can survive anything but steel against your threat. Then it is over. The end.
CONOR: How can I stop such a man?
ROMIREZ: Hide. Run to the ends of the Earth till you learn. You must learn to defend yourself. In this I can help.
CONOR: Why?
ROMIREZ: We are brothers. And you are a defense- -of sorts.
MR. NORTH: When your father died I saw to it that the grounds were kept up.
TAUPIN: The money in the estate was enough to cover your costs?
MR. NORTH: Oh yes, more than enough.
