LT. QUIFFER: I'm sorry, Major Kong. I guess I was way out of line.
MAJOR KONG: Forget it, Quentin. It can happen to the best of us. Now let's get squared away.
MAJOR KONG: Give me a first rough course as soon as you can, Lieutenant Ballmuff.
LT. BALLMUFF: Roughly, one-zero-five. I'll have it plotted in a minute, Major Kong.
MAJOR KONG: Okay. Check these points. Complete radio silence. To ensure that the enemy can't plant false transmissions and fake orders, the CRM-114 is to be switched into all receiver circuits. The three code letters of the period are to be set on the alphabet dials of the CRM-114, which will in turn block any transmissions other than those preceded by the code letters. You got it?
LT. TOEJAM: Roger, I'm setting up the CRM-114.
MAJOR KONG: Primary target the ICBM base at Laputa. One weapon fused for air burst at ten thou- sand. Second weapon to be used if first malfunctions. Otherwise the secondary gets it - the airfield outside of Karnak. Fused air burst at ten thousand.
LT. BALLMUFF: I've got the heading, Major. One-three-eight.
MAJOR KONG: Roger. One-three-eight.
MAJOR KONG: In about twenty minutes we start losing height to keep under coastal radar. Cross in over the coast low-level, continue low- level on zig-zag legs to primary, and climb for bomb run. Any questions?
LT. ZOGG: I've got one.
MAJOR KONG: Shoot, Lothar.
LT. ZOGG: Our targets are a missile complex and an airfield - not cities, right?
MAJOR KONG: That's what I said.
LT. ZOGG: Well, if there's a war, they must have hit us first.
MAJOR KONG: What's your point, Lothar?
LT. ZOGG: Well, if they hit us first, they've probably fired off their missiles and got their planes off the ground already. We'll just be hitting empty real estate.
MAJOR KONG: Are you saying our order don't make sense?
LT. ZOGG: Hellnno, Major. I was just trying to think the thing through.
