MERRICK: He was slow. Very simple. They won't all be that easy.
BUFFY: Fine.
MERRICK: And the alley was a mistake. Never corner yourself like that. If they'd come at you in force you'd be dead now. One vampire is a lot easier to kill then ten.
BUFFY: Does the world 'Duhh' mean anything to you?
MERRICK: You felt a little sick, didn't you? The cramps.
BUFFY: Nice conversationalist! Yeah, I felt 'em a little, but I ain't due for two weeks since you're so excited about the subject.
MERRICK: It's natural. A reaction to their presence, to the... unnaturalness of it. It's part of how you are able to track them.
BUFFY: Oh, wonderful. My secret weapon is - PMS. That's just great. Thanks for telling me.
MERRICK: You'll get used to it. I'm more worried about your tactical mistakes.
BUFFY: You are such a wet.
MERRICK: A what?
BUFFY: A wet! Didn't I just kill that vampire? I think I did. I didn't see you killing any vampires. You were too busy playing 'Beat the Clock'.
MERRICK: Don't start with me again.
BUFFY: Aren't I, like the chosen one? The one and only? The Grand High Poobah and doesn't that mean you have to be nice to me? Like, ever?
MERRICK: Buffy...
BUFFY: And why are you always wearing black? It's so down. It's totally not your color. I don't think you have a color.
MERRICK: What do you want? Encouragement? 'Gosh, Buffy, you're so special, I just want to give you a great big hug, oh I'm just having a warm fuzzy.'
BUFFY: Oh, fuck you!
MERRICK: Do you know how many girls I've trained to be Slayers? Five. Five properly prepared girls, girls who faced their responsibilities, who worked hard to become women overnight -- harder than you've ever worked in your life -- and I saw them ripped apart. Do you want to live? Do you?
BUFFY: I...
MERRICK: What did you think, that being able to jump about and hit people makes you a Slayer?
BUFFY: Five?
MERRICK: Five.
BUFFY: So, basically, I've got the life expectancy of a zit, right?
MERRICK: Not if you're careful.
BUFFY: How can you keep doing this?
MERRICK: It's what I was raised to do. There aren't many of us left, the Watchers.
BUFFY: Watchers?
MERRICK: There's a small village in Hampshire, near Stonehenge... ... near a bunch of big rocks. That's where I was born. My father taught me about the training, about finding the Slayers, reading the signs. There's a small cluster of us, a few families, really... most of the neighboring villagers think we're just a bunch of harmless old loonies. I thought so myself for a time, when I was younger... I'm sorry. I'm not supposed to... I shouldn't go on like this.
BUFFY: I wish you would.
MERRICK: It isn't important.
BUFFY: I'm curious, is all.
MERRICK: Buffy, don't... don't start thinking of me as your friend. It interferes with the work, and it...
BUFFY: And it makes it worse when I die, right?
BUFFY: Well, you know, I'm not gonna kick so easy. I've got a few things the other girls didn't have.
MERRICK: As for example, what?
BUFFY: Well... there's my keen fashion sense, for one.
MERRICK: Vampires of the world, beware.
BUFFY: Merrick. You made a joke. Are you okay, I mean, do you want to lie down? I know it hurts the first time.
JENNIFER: So they found Cassandra's body out by the railway tunnels. Nobody's saying anything, but they think she was involved in something, like, illegal or something. Like dealing.
KIMBERLY: Well, I hope so.
JENNIFER: Probably was. What do you suppose she was doing out there.
BUFFY: Dying.
JENNIFER: Eeyuu.
ANDY: ... And they're having some memorial service or something tomorrow. You going?
JEFFREY: I don't know. Coach said I had to work on my 'ab's.'
ANDY: Coach knows what abs are?
