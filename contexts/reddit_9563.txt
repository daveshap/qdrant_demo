In addition to starting my first Student Affairs job this year, I have been accepted to an Ed.M program in College Student Affairs!
I just wanted to thank this subreddit for all the help when it came to applying to graduate school and so many looking at my essay! Following my application, I was invited for interviews at Rutgers University's Graduate School of Education in late February! Admission is contingent on obtaining and accepting an internship, and after a scary interview days I am blessed to have been offered a position! I can't wait to start this Fall and learn more about how I fit into higher education! As someone future-oriented, I hope to learn so much and eventually obtain my PhD and become a Dean/Director of a program!
