How to get rid of an unwanted friend?
I'll try to keep this short but there is a lot to say.

There's this boy (we'll call him Jake), who hangs out with me and my friends everyday. However, I really don't like Jake at all. Although my friends don't really understand it (well they feel bad for him so they choose to ignore it), I see what he's really like. He's mouthy, incredibly rude, kills all our conversations/jokes, extremely nosy, makes "jokes" about things we're very insecure about, has no filter, always tries to bring me down, etc and he doesn't even try to hide it. He's only started hanging out with us recently (say, for the last few months) but me and my friends have been together since middle school and Jake is really ruining our dynamic. I wish he would leave but every time I mention it, my friends take his side and tell me not to start something. I've tried to talk to them, especially Jake, about it but they say it's not worth it but it's ruining my favourite part of school (hanging out with my friends), so why shouldn't I get to have a say on that? I can't just walk away from my group as an ultimatum because although I do have other friends, they've got their own group dynamics and besides, why should \*I\* have to leave \*my\* best friends for someone they don't like that much either? I'm pretty sure he has at least a few other friends so I don't see why he wants to hang out with us when all we do is argue.

I hope this all makes sense and any advice on how to approach this would be helpful, thanks.
