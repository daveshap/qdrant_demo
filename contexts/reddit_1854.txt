How $5 got me into Columbia.
Saw the post about someone being nice and getting into Yale. I have a somewhat similar story to share that some of you might enjoy. You never know how much being nice really can pay off!

My sophomore year (two years ago) I was on the school tennis team, and one day we traveled downtown to an all-day tennis tournament between teams from all over the city. The parents dropped us off and we were on our own other than our coaches. Halfway through the day I noticed this freshman on another team forgot to bring a lunch. He was sitting by himself hungry and alone and I felt bad, so I went over and offered to buy him something. He politely declined but I knew he was hungry and insisted he eat. I went over to the snack stand and bought him a hotdog and some ice cream for $5 and brought him over to eat with my group of friends. After we went back to our own tennis tournaments and I thought nothing of it.

At the end of the day as I was leaving some woman ran up to me in the parking lot and greeted me by name. It was the kid's mother so I'm assuming he had told her about me, and she thanked me over and over again for buying her son lunch. I told her it was no big deal and I was happy to help. That was the only time I saw that woman...

...until two months ago when I arrived at my Columbia interviewer's office. I walked in and she greeted me happily, as if she knew me, and it didn't hit me until I got into talking about playing tennis that it was her kid who I had bought lunch for two years ago. I didn't bring it up but I knew it was her, and I knew she knew remebered me when she brought up that day. It was by far my best interview. 
&nbsp;

Two months later, I was rejected from every ivy/ivy+ except one, and that was Columbia. I honestly can't believe that this happened and I really have no idea how much of an impact that event had on my acceptance, but I'm pretty sure she wrote about it in her interview report and that's what got me in. After I got in (literally like 2 hours after), she sent me a super ecstatic email about how much I deserve this acceptance and to keep on doing what I'm doing. Never thought something like this would happen in my life.

**TL;DR** Went to a tennis tournament, saw some kid forgot his lunch. Bought him lunch for like $5 and his mom was super thankful. Two years later that mom was my Columbia interviewer and remembered who I was. Now I can proudly say #roar2022
