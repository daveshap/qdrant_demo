ANN: John and Cynthia have been... fucking"."
GRAHAM: I know.
ANN: You know?
GRAHAM: Yes.
ANN: How did you know?
GRAHAM: She said it on her tape.
ANN: Why didn't you tell me?
GRAHAM: Ann, when would I have told you? We were not speaking, if you recall.
GRAHAM: But even if we had been speaking, I wouldn't have told you.
ANN: Why not?
GRAHAM: It's not my place to tell you these things, Ann. You have to find out by yourself or from John directly. You have to trust me on this.
