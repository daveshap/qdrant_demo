EVE: You're happy, aren't you?
LUTHOR: La de da da...
EVE: You're not going to tell us why you're happy, are you?
LUTHOR: The door jam, Miss Teschmacher. This Ethiopian shmendrick here, in his simple, unconscious way, needed something to wedge the door open, the better to inhale the flies that form such an important part of his diet. So he grabs something from the table...
EVE: We just take it?
LUTHOR: What do you suggest, my dear?
EVE: The least we can do is leave him another door jam.
