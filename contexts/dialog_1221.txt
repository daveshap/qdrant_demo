MRS. HOBBS: Miss Price.
ALEX: Yes, Mrs. Hobbs.
MRS. HOBBS: Take these round now, will you please? The American boy in twenty-one is only to have these after he's eaten. Will you be sure of that?
ALEX: Has he been refusing food?
MRS. HOBBS: Nothing quite as dramatic as that, Miss Price. He just doesn't eat enough of what is put before him. He suffers from nightmares. I'd think he just needs a hand to hold.
ALEX: Yes, Mrs. Hobbs.
ALEX: Hello, Benjamin.
BENJAMIN: No.
ALEX: No what?
BENJAMIN: No.
ALEX: Well, all right then, be that way. Here, swallow this.
BENJAMIN: No.
ALEX: Feeling better?
BENJAMIN: No.
ALEX: The doctor will be round later. Would you like a picture book to look at? We have some lovely funny Beanos.
BENJAMIN: No.
ALEX: Right.
ALEX: Has the patient in twenty-one gotten his tray yet?
ORDERLY: The American? Yes, duck.
ALEX: How did he look?
ORDERLY: What do you mean, 'how did he look'?
ALEX: You know, did he seem depressed? Do you think he'll eat the food?
ORDERLY: I'm an orderly, not a bleeding psychiatrist! I push things about, but I've little say what happens to them.
ALEX: Thank you.
ALEX: Mr. Kessler?
DAVID: Yes?
ALEX: You haven't eaten your lunch.
DAVID: I'm not very hungry, thank you.
ALEX: I'm afraid you have to eat something.
DAVID: Please, really. I'm not hungry.
ALEX: You put me in an awkward position, Mr. Kessler.
DAVID: How is that?
ALEX: Well, you're to take these after you've eaten. Now what kind of nurse would I be if I failed in so simple a task as giving out some pills?
DAVID: Leave the pills. I'll take them later.
ALEX: Sorry.
DAVID: Aw come on, Miss Price!
ALEX: Call me Alex.
DAVID: Aw come on, Alex!
ALEX: Shall I be forced to feed you, Mr. Kessler?
DAVID: Call me David.
ALEX: Shall I be forced to feed you, David?
DAVID: This is absurd. I'm not hungry. I don't want any food.
ALEX: Right.
ALEX: Let's try a little harder, shall we?
DAVID: Will you give me a break?
