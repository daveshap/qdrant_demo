ED: I'11 have to pass, Al. And it's not an age thing --
AL: No! Do they show you having sex?
ED: No. Kissing and hugging, okay, but if it's actual sex they have to cut away.
AL: At what point?
ED: At the point -- I don't -- Look you'd be on TV maybe one or two times each. I'11 try to avoid I'11 go out of my way to avoid, getting together with you. Believe me.
