When I grow up I don’t want a desk job, is a FireFighter a good job?
I’m in my fifth year at grammar school in the UK, for my A-Levels I’m gonna do Maths, Physics, Computer Science and maybe Spanish.

The thing is, I don’t want a job like accountancy, or working in a bank. Yeah salary is important but I want a job that’s going to really satisfy my life.

Recently I’ve been thinking of becoming a firefighter, is anyone on here a firefighter that could give me advice? Or is there any other more adventurous jobs that surround my current subject choice?
