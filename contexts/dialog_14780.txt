BERLIN: You don't wanna sit here any more, sweetheart ..
HELENA: I wanna be near you ...
BERLIN: I think they're gonna arrest me.
HELENA: I don't want them to arrest you.
BERLIN: It's not as bad as it sounds .. They can't refuse me bail. Raise bail of my own cognizance & find the best damned lawyer there is ..
