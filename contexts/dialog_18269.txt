LORETTA: Oh my God.
RONNY: What?
LORETTA: What? What have we done?
RONNY: Take it easy.
LORETTA: This time I was trying to do everything right.
RONNY: Don't just become excited.
LORETTA: I thought if I stayed away from the City Hall, I won't have that Bad Luck I had again.
RONNY: You're trying to make me feel guilty.
LORETTA: I'm marrying your brother!
RONNY: All right, I'm guilty. I confess!
LORETTA: You're invited to the wedding! It's in a few weeks. Why didn't you do like him and be with your dying mother in Palermo?
RONNY: She didn't like me.
LORETTA: You don't get along with anybody!
RONNY: What did you do?
LORETTA: What did I do?
RONNY: You ruined my life.
LORETTA: That's impossible! It was ruint when I got here! You ruint my life!
RONNY: Oh no I didn't!
LORETTA: Oh yes, oh yes you did! You've got those bad eyes like a gypsy! Why didn't I see it yesterday! Bad Luck! Is that all I'm ever gonna have? Why didn't I just pick up a stone and kill myself years and years ago? I'm gonna marry him!
RONNY: What?
LORETTA: Last night never happened, you hear me? I'm gonna marry him anyway and last night never happened, and you and I are gonna take this to our coffins!
RONNY: I can't do that!
LORETTA: Why not?
RONNY: I'm in love with you!
LORETTA: Snap out of it!
RONNY: I can't!
LORETTA: Alright. Then I must never see you again. The bad blood will have to stay there between you and Johnny for all time. You won't come to the wedding.
RONNY: I'll come to the wedding.
LORETTA: I'm telling you you can't.
RONNY: But he wants me to come!
LORETTA: But that's cause he don't know!
RONNY: Alright. I will not come. Provided one thing.
LORETTA: What?
RONNY: That you come with me tonight. Once. To the Opera.
LORETTA: What are you talking about?
RONNY: I love two things. I love you, and I love the Opera. If I can have the two things that I love together for one night, I will be satisfied to give up the rest of my life.
LORETTA: Alright.
RONNY: Alright. Meet me at the Met.
LORETTA: Alright. Where's the Met?
LORETTA: Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. It's been two months since my last confession.
PRIEST: What sins have you to confess?
LORETTA: Twice I took the name of God in vain, once I slept with the brother of my fiancé, and once I bounced a check at the liquor store -- but that was really an accident.
PRIEST: Then it was not a sin. But what was that second thing you said, Loretta?
LORETTA: I... a... slept with my fiancé's brother.
PRIEST: That's a pretty big sin.
LORETTA: I know.
PRIEST: You should think about this.
LORETTA: I know.
PRIEST: Alright. This is your penance. Say two rosaries and... be careful, Loretta. Reflect on your life.
LORETTA: Alright.
PRIEST: I absolve you in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, Amen.
LORETTA: Hi.
ROSE: Where you been?
LORETTA: I don't wanna talk about it.
ROSE: Just like your father. I lied to him. He thinks you came home last night.
LORETTA: Thanks. What's the matter with you?
ROSE: Cosmo's cheating on me.
LORETTA: What! How do you know?
ROSE: A wife knows.
LORETTA: Then you don't know. You're just imagining it. He's too old.
