This is how you can stop cringing at that embarrassing thing you did 5 years ago!
So a friend told me this and I think it's really helpful.

If you ever catch yourself rethinking something humiliating you did, stop and instead try to remember something embarrassing someone else did.
You probably can't and that's probably the case for everyone else and nobody remembers what you did.
