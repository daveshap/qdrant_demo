NAPOLEON: Good morning, Citizen de Beauharnais.
EUGENE: Good morning, sir. Are you General Bonaparte?
NAPOLEON: I am, Citizen. Is your mother Madame Josephine de Beauharnais?
EUGENE: Yes, sir. Are you acquainted with her?
NAPOLEON: I have met her. What is your business with me?
EUGENE: I believe you issued an order that all citizens of Paris must hand over any weapons that they have in their possession.
NAPOLEON: That is correct.
EUGENE: This morning, a Lieutenant and three soldiers came to our house and asked if we had weapons. I explained we had only my late father's sword, which, in fact, was not a weapon but only a keepsake of memory.
NAPOLEON: A sword is a weapon whatever else you might wish to use it for.
EUGENE: I told the Lieutenant my late father was General Alexander de Beauharnais, and asked if there was any consideration that might be given to his memory.
NAPOLEON: And he sent you to me?
EUGENE: He said no one had the authority to rescind the order except you.
NAPOLEON: Does your mother know you have come?
EUGENE: No, sir.
NAPOLEON: Well, then, you have a lot of initiative, my young friend.
EUGENE: My father's sword means more to me than any other possession I have.
NAPOLEON: You realize, of course, that thousands of swords have been collected. How do you expect me to find yours?
