I got an ”we let you know if there is some opening”
I applied for a part time staffing job. Its a staffing company where they send you out to food shops in need of staffing, in short.

I got an email yesterday from the recruiter, he told me that I definitely have a good and relevant resume but they are full now but they will keep me in their bank.

Later today I’m at the job databank site and I find this company has put out a “new” add searching for applicants. 

How do one interpret this?🤔 Is this normal? Can the reason be they are trying to “widen” their applicants data bank?
