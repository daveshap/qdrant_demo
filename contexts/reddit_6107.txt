take unpaid time off due to fear of COVID19?
I work at a place that doesn't allow for work from home, even though most of my work can be done from home. I'm job searching now and got plenty of savings (enough for years, and I estimate a 3 month timeframe to get a different job in my field)

I want to ask for 3 month unpaid time off due to fear of virus, is that a valid reason to give them? If they turn me down I might just quit.

Thanks
