Not sure who's being petty here
I live with two other roommates, both of which I consider my closest friends. One I've lived with since last September, the other moved in last month. We were friends before, they didn't get along great with their other roommates, and we had an empty room. So, them and their dog moved in. It's been a little rocky, because they don't mesh as well with my other roommate's and my living style, but we can work past it.

What's bothering me is: newest roommate and I were looking for a class to take together, which is a long and tedious process (we're studying abroad, to make matters more difficult). I was a little annoyed that they obviously don't care about this class as much as I do, and while we were looking over the schedule, apparently they thought that I was double checking them often. I came home to grab something really quickly when they thought I would be out, and left again. I got a text from them saying that if I overheard them bitching about me being condescending and thinking that they're incompetent to my other roommate, they were sorry and should have brought it up to me. I didn't hear them, so it was unpleasant to find out that they'd been talking about me while I wasn't there, and even more annoying when I apologized for making them feel that way, and that it wasn't my intent. They responded that they knew it wasn't my intent, but it still happened and I hurt their feelings.

I feel like it was a little petty for them to bring it up to me in the first place. They know my intents aren't malicious, and double checking everyone is just a habit/character trait of mine, because I don't trust that I'm not getting wrong information, especially in this particular situation where I give a lot more shits than they do. I was exasperated, because what am I supposed to do about it? Sorry I hurt your feelings, I guess you just don't like my personality in that case? I feel like they're starting drama where there doesn't need to be.
