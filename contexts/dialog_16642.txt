NONA: What?
QUINCY: We still have to go?
NONA: Yeah.
NONA: ...we moved back here when Quincy was about five, after Zeke was traded. Neighborhood was a little more mixed back then...
CAMILLE: Until the Black family down the street became the Black family next door.
NONA: Okay?
CAMILLE: Well, thanks again. This was really nice of you.
NONA: It was the least we could do. And I love to cook.
CAMILLE: Oh, me too. I used to cook for my friends' parties and things back in Atlanta.
NONA: You're a caterer?
CAMILLE: Well, no, but once Nathan gets settled and the girls get a little older, it's definitely something I want to do. Since you love to cook, maybe it's something we can talk about.
NONA: You know, girl, long as I've lived next door, I've never seen the inside of this house.
CAMILLE: Really? Well, come on, then.
