I'm not sure I want to stay in school
I spent all day battling myself with this.  I know that I won't get to where I want to go without school, I know that nothing particularly good will come of my leaving school, but I can't bring myself to be excited about the next quarter.  

I turned 18 3 days ago, and I'm in my first year of college, which I started a year early.  I started college a year early because I left high school twice due to medical issues (mostly resolved now), and just basically said "fuck it," and got my GED.  

My brother took a year off after his first year of university, got a job, and ended up hating it.  We're now going to the same community college.  I know this is exactly what will happen to me, but I just can't stand the thought of continuing to go to school.  I've been bored of it for as long as I can remember, and I don't enjoy myself at all.

I spent all day today crying on and off, and when I wasn't crying I was on the verge of tears and the slightest thing set me off.  I just don't know what to do, and I feel lost.  I know what I want to do eventually, but right now I don't feel like I'm accomplishing that.
