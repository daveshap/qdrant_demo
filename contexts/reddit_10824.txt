Does anyone else find that the fear of what’s on the other side keeps you from killing yourself but somehow that makes you more depressed?
I just feel like that survival instinct that kicks in just makes everything ten times worse. And people who say well that’s a sign that you shouldn’t do it don’t get how that isn’t it at all. I’m already not human I’ve already lost my mind I have nothing left. Like it just feels like torture.
