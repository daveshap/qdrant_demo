After 63 months, I’ve finally paid my car off and will now have an extra 304.11 to my name each month.
I feel like I got duped into a auto loan by a dealership five years ago and now I’m free($18,500 when you add it all up, even with the extended warranty added). I officially own my car. I almost don’t regret it as it has come in handy several times in the moving across the country a few different times for various seasonal work but man has it been a struggle some months. Even if it were my last $300, it went to my car. I’ve had to borrow money for my payments twice and have always felt eternally grateful for those individuals that helped me out. I am overwhelmed with this new freedom and it’s only been a couple days since I put that last payment in the mail. I want to share this with the world but really the first person I told was my dad who put his name up for the co-sign. He’s pretty happy too. Suggestions for what I could do with the extra money? It’s been so long since I haven’t had to worry about the 13th of every month that I’m sure I’ll recover from that anxiety, but not sure if it will be for a couple months.
