WAITER: Yes, Miss.
BETTY: I'd like a dry Martini. Very dry, please.
WAITER: Sorry, Miss. Beer and ale only. Canadian law.
BETTY: Beer? Well, all right.
WAITER: Beer or ale, Miss?
BETTY: Ale. I don't mind.
WAITER: Right, Miss.
BETTY: Your liquor laws..
BRANDON: Disgusting, aren't they? If you really want a Martini, I know where you can get one.
BRANDON: A fellow named Brandon has a penthouse here. He's holding open house. I was up there. Too noisy. Bored.
BETTY: I see.
BRANDON: It might be worth a Martini to you.
BETTY: I don't need it that badly. I don't enjoy crashing other people's parties.
BRANDON: It's open-house. No crashing involved. Anybody in the hotel's welcome.
BETTY: What did you say his name was?
BRANDON: Brandon. Clark Brandon. Fellow about my age. Lot of money... that he didn't make. Former American. Now naturalized in Canada. Social standing indeterminate. Manners not quite perfect. Scotch superb.
BETTY: You don't sound as if you liked him very much.
BRANDON: No.. not very well. And I like his friends even less. But.. If you really want a good dry Martini..
BETTY: As I said before...
BRANDON: Sure. But I'd hate like the Dickens to be held to everything I've said before, wouldn't you?
BETTY: You're not paying for this. It's quite enough that you let me sit at your table.
BRANDON: I never pay for anything. They just keep me here to amuse the guests.
BETTY: And do you amuse the guests?
BRANDON: No. Are you really going to drink that stuff?
BETTY: You're drinking it.
BRANDON: I can be talked out of it. As a matter of fact, I'd like a dry Martini myself.
BETTY: Would it make you anymore amusing?
BRANDON: Whatever you say.
BETTY: I didn't say anything.
BRANDON: I don't know you and you don't know me. I made a reasonably polite suggestion. But I'm sure you'd rather be alone.
BETTY: I hate to be alone. But I've heard all the approaches there are... even yours.
BRANDON: Neatly said...but to the wrong man. The trouble with pretty girls is that they can't imagine anyone thinking of anything else but the fact they are pretty girls. I get tired of it.
BETTY: Do you think I don't?
BRANDON: Thanks for the fresh air. That felt good.
BETTY: You're sure Mr. Brandon won't mind?
BRANDON: He doesn't even know half the people who come up to drink his liquor.
