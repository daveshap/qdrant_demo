Hillary Clinton is often referred to as the "Presumptive Nominee" for the Democratic party. At what point, if any, does Trump become the Republicans' presumptive nominee? Are we already there?
I interpret the term "Presumptive Nominee" to mean that none of the candidate's competitors have a realistic path to the nomination.  I think it's safe to say that about Hillary at this point, but what about Trump?

Some googling of the term "presumptive nominee" did turn up some recent [news](https://www.bostonglobe.com/news/nation/2016/03/01/clinton-and-trump-are-now-presumptive-nominees-for-their-parties-get-used/DJYuI6rQxkh7bXr2aDvfkM/story.html) [articles](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/02/25/donald-trump-needs-to-win-only-39-percent-of-super-tuesday-delegates-to-stay-on-pace-to-be-the-gop-nominee/) referring to Trump, but that still feels a little premature to me.
