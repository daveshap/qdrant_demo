Apps you use to stay productive - what are some of your "top" apps?
Mac user here - What are some of your favorite apps for being productive?  For example, Mendeley, Zotero? Do you prefer OneNote, Evernote? An alternative? If so, why?  What about a free alternative to Adobe Reader? Is there an email "app" that you prefer over Apple Mail or Outlook? (I'm on Mac OS Catalina 10.15.4 and getting really fed up with the Apple mail window opening seemingly randomly) If so, what makes it stand out to you? Is there a calendar app that is better than iCal or Google calendar that's worth looking into? These are just examples - but what are some apps you've found, how effective do you find them to be, and what do you recommend and why?  Just curious to find out what you're all using day to day, how you're liking it, and hopefully I can find some new recommendations, especially during this new normal we're all finding ourselves in.
