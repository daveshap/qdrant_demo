CHARLIE: Neighbor, I'd feel better about the damned inconvenience if you'd let me buy you a drink.
BARTON: That's all right, really, thank you.
CHARLIE: All right, hell, you trying to work and me carrying on in there. Look, the liquor's good, wuddya say?
CHARLIE: ... You got a glass? It's the least I can do.
BARTON: Okay... a quick one, sure...
CHARLIE: Yeah, just a nip. I feel like hell, all the carryings-on next door.
BARTON: That's okay, I assure you. It's just that I was trying to work –
CHARLIE: What kind of work do you do, Barton, if you don't mind my asking?
BARTON: Well, I'm a writer, actually.
CHARLIE: You don't say. That's a tough racket. My hat's off to anyone who can make a go of it. Damned interesting work, I'd imagine.
BARTON: Can be. Not easy, but –
CHARLIE: Damned difficult, I'd imagine.
BARTON: And what's your line, Mr. Meadows?
CHARLIE: Hell no! Call me Charlie. Well Barton, you might say I sell peace of mind. Insurance is my game – door-to-door, human contact, still the only way to move merchandise.
CHARLIE: ...In spite of what you might think from tonight, I'm pretty good at it.
BARTON: Doesn't surprise me at all.
CHARLIE: Hell yes. Because I believe in it. Fire, theft, and casualty are not things that only happen to other people – that's what I tell 'em. Writing doesn't work out, you might want to look into it. Providing for basic human need – a fella could do worse.
BARTON: Thanks, I'll keep it in mind.
CHARLIE: What kind of scribbler are you – newspaperman did you say?
BARTON: No, I'm actually writing for the pictures now –
CHARLIE: Pictures! Jesus!
