Being treated as a second option
I (26F) went on a first date with a guy (26M) and it went well. We met at my old job and were just getting to know each other mostly on the date. We have similar interests and values, and he acted excited about hanging out again. We also were messaging pretty regularly before the date. 

We plan to hang out again a few days later and he is giving me signals he’s interested and excited about it. He agrees to hang out then immediately cancels saying he forgot he had plans. Then he stops initiating convos, so I try initiating more but he isn’t responding to any of my snaps and contributes the bare minimum to conversations 

And a week later posts an Instagram pic with a new girl. Like seriously? I know we didn’t have much invested but why act into me and then ignore me, and have the audacity to post that shit

I feel like at this point he’s just keeping his options open, otherwise he could’ve just told me wasn’t feeling it. Dating is shitty

TLDR; mixed signals, ghosting, and being treated as a second option can gtfo
