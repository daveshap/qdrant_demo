DON: So that's the story of 7 1/2. Since the rents are considerably lower this floor has been adopted by businesses which for one reason or another are forced to cut corners After all... the overhead is low! Ha ha ha!
WENDY: Ha ha ha!
CRAIG: Moving story.
MAXINE: Yes. Unfortunately it's bullshit. The real story of 7 1/2 is so evil that it could never be revealed to Americans raised on sitcoms and happy news anchors.
CRAIG: Is that true?
MAXINE: Well, truth is for suckers, isn't it?.
CRAIG: Listen. I'm Craig Schwartz, just starting out at LesterCorp.
MAXINE: How dreary - to be - Somebody / How public - like a Frog / To tell one's name - the livelong June / To an admiring Bog!
CRAIG: Emily Dickinson.
MAXINE: I wouldn't know.
