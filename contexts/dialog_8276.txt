KIP: What is this business with you and explosives? Do you think you're immune?
HANA: I promise you that was the right thing to do. He's my good luck. Now cut. This one. I hope we don't die.
KIP: Okay. Get away from here. Quick.
HANA: I'm not scared. So many people have died around me. But I would be a shame for us. I don't feel like being shy.
KIP: You must get away. Before I cut. I'm not cutting if you're here. He's struggling. He's going to topple over if he cuts.
HANA: Actually, you can't cut, can you? You'll fall over. Give me the pliers.
KIP: No. But he hands them over.
HANA: Kiss me. Before I cut. Just in case.
KIP: Don't talk. Check again. Lie flat and then cut.
