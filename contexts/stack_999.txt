SSH, Webmin, etc. stopped working after CPU upgrade I upgraded the CPU in my home server: i3-3220T -> E3-1265L V2. The upgrade was succesfull, the server started proerly, however some services stopped working.I cannot use SSH now. I checked the service is running on the server. I cannot load the page of webmin running on the server on my desktop PC, and have the same issue on localhost.The new CPU supports AES-NI, the old one did not.What could I do?Thank you in advance.
