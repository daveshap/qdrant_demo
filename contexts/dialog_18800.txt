SAUNDRA: Hey Matty, don't wait for me or anything.
MATTHEW: I was thinking maybe we should try this dinner thing again, but maybe the Epcot version will be open by then....
MATTHEW: Sweet Jesus I never dreamed I'd be glad to see Central Park at night.
SAUNDRA: We made it !
SAUNDRA: What now ?
MATTHEW: I want to go to sleep for about a month.
SAUNDRA: No, idiot. Where do we go now ?
MATTHEW: Where are we ?
