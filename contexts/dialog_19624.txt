NEIL: You're not going in. That's exactly what he wants. As long as you're on Hypnocyl, it's the only way he can get to you.
NANCY: Don't you think I know that? I don't have any choice.
NEIL: Bullshit. Getting yourself killed won't do the kids any good. Besides, we do have a choice.

NANCY: They burned him to death in his boiler room, but they were smart enough to hide the remains.
NEIL: Who would know where they were hidden?
NANCY: There's only one man...and its time for him to talk.
