SONNY: You take care of Paulie?
CLEMENZA: You won't see Paulie anymore. He's sick for good this winter.
SONNY: Where are you going?
MICHAEL: To the city.
SONNY: Send some bodyguards.
MICHAEL: I don't need them, Sonny. I'm just going to see Pop in the hospital. Also, I got other things.
CLEMENZA: Sollozzo knows Mike's a civilian.
SONNY: OK, but be careful.
MICHAEL: Visiting hour ends at eight thirty. I'll just sit with him; I want to show respect.
KAY: Can I go to the hospital with you?
MICHAEL: I don't think so. You don't want to end up on page 3 of the Daily News.
KAY: My parents don't read the Daily News. All right, if you think I shouldn't. I can't believe the things the papers are printing. I'm sure most of it's not true.
MICHAEL: I don't think so either. I better go.
KAY: When will I see you again?
MICHAEL: I want you to go back to New Hampshire...think things over.
KAY: When will I see you again?
MICHAEL: Goodbye.
