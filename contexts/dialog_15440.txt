O'CONNOR: Jesus Christ. That's a real blockbuster. I always figured you guys had it made.
TED: You want to know the real kicker? The real kicker is, for the first time in my life-- the first time--I feel like a loser.
O'CONNOR: Listen, don't let it get you down. You're going to be fine.
TED: Me? I've never been better. I mean having my wife walk out on me after seven years of marriage agrees with me just fine.
O'CONNOR: Look, Ted, I'm the oldest whore on the beat, okay? Three marriages, two divorces...You're gonna be okay.
TED: I'm going to be okay. The way I see it, Joanna'll come home, it's just a matter of time.
O'CONNOR: She'll be back...
O'CONNOR: But...just in case...I mean, just on the off chance she doesn't. What are you going to do about the kid?
TED: I don't know, Jim. This whole thing has happened so...Pow-- like that.
O'CONNOR: Look, it's none of my business, so you can tell me to butt out, okay? But if you want my advice, you'll send Billy away to stay with relatives for a while. Just until you get yourself straightened out.
TED: I don't know, Jim...
O'CONNOR: Ted, this may sound a little rough, but we've just landed the biggest account in the history of this agency, right? And now it's up to us--that's you and me --to deliver the goods. Ted, you're my main man, and if I can't depend on you a hundred and ten percent, twenty-four hours a day, because you're worried about a kid with a runny nose--
TED: Jim, I appreciate what you're saying. I mean it, but I really think Joanna's coming back.
