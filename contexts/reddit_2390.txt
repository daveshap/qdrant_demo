Does anyone else feel like people in corporate like to make things a lot more difficult than they need to be?
I have so many stupid email chains where people canâ€™t just say what they want to say they feel the need to tip toe around the subject and it just irritates me because it makes is hard to understand what is really being asked. And makes the process longer. How do you guys combat Corporate bullshit?
