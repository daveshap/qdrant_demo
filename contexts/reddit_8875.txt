Is the pace of President Trump's Cabinet appointments similar to those of previous administrations?
According to this [tracker](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/trump-administration-appointee-tracker/database/) from *The Washington Post*, 61 of 553 "key executive branch positions", all of which require Senate confirmation, have either a nominee awaiting confirmation, or are filled by a confirmed nominee. The feature shows that Trump sent 33 nominations to the Senate, higher than recent presidents, including Clinton and both Bushes, but lower than Obama. Since then, he has named 28 more to executive branch positions. This still leaves many departments without a Deputy Secretary named, including State, Labor, Interior, and Education. Is this typical of an administration in its first few months, or are lower-level positions (e.g. deputy and assistant secretaries) in Cabinet departments filled more quickly?
