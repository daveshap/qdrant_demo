I can't believe I did it-- some hope for the out of high school crowd.
Hi all!
I have been religiously following this subreddit. I just kind of wanted to share because I'm still in awe.

I got in to every school I applied to! Xavier, UMass Lowell, Mizzou (*with an automatic transfer scholarship), and IU East. Now I'm a 29F who graduated in 2008 and when I said "graduated" I mean by the skin of my teeth. I was a lazy high schooler who had to go to summer school, night school, and Saturday school just to walk across stage and get my diploma at a 0.97 GPA. I really just didn't think school was for me, even though I felt for the most part capable and intelligent. I had no drive.

After a few years of retail jobs that I was miserable at and seeing my fellow slacker crew graduating I began to feel a bit envious and enrolled in my local community college where I discovered a love for education I wish I had years ago. I somehow managed to get a 3.6 GPA and join the Honors Program and now I'm staring in disbelief as these acceptance letters come in.

I'm so grateful for online programs that are going to allow me to finally be a college graduate (alas, because of work Xavier is a no-go as it doesn't have a fully online degree program =[)

Anyway, I just wanted to let any other adult that thinks maybe it's too late or they can't work a full-time job and go to school that it's entirely possible. Also for any other slackers that every passing minute is another chance to turn it all around.

Thanks guys for listening to my rambling! Now to choose, which is proving to be super difficult haha.
