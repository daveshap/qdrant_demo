TAUPIN: Run!
KNIGHT: MACLEOD!
BRENNA: Jesus Christ.
TAUPIN: You'll be safe here. He won't kill in a church.
BRENNA: Why not?
TAUPIN: Tradition.
BRENNA: What the hell is going on?
CONOR: Afternoon.
ROMIREZ: Your name is Conor?
CONOR: Aye.
ROMIREZ: Juan Cid Romirez. Chief surveyor and alchemist.
CONOR: You're not from these parts.
ROMIREZ: I am from Spain. And I would like a moment of your time.
CONOR: I haven't much to offer, Mr. Romirez from Spain, but you're welcome to what's here.
ROMIREZ: Please go to no trouble.
ROMIREZ: Your back, it would seem perhaps you were injured in battle?
CONOR: Five years past me clan fought another over some- thing I cannot even re- member.
ROMIREZ: Your marks would suggest great injury.
CONOR: I was nearly killed.
ROMIREZ: But you lived.
CONOR: I did at that.
ROMIREZ: And but for a mark you are well as any man, no?
CONOR: Aye.
ROMIREZ: I should imagine that your recovery must have alarmed your fellow villagers, perhaps giving them reason to invent an explanation. And a solution.
CONOR: I was driven out.
ROMIREZ: And now you live in a small village miles away from all you knew.
CONOR: How can you know this?
ROMIREZ: First food, no? A good meal makes conversation so much easier.
ROMIREZ: Hmm, que rico. What is it you call this?
CONOR: Pheasant.
ROMIREZ: You Scots have a way with game. It still has life in it. Spirit. Back home the food is so...domestic.
CONOR: Why are you here?
ROMIREZ: I was sent by his majesty of Spain to Inverness as a con- sultant on matters of metal.
CONOR: You're a long way from Inverness.
ROMIREZ: In my travels I heard the story of the MacLeod boy struck down and brought from the hand of death by powers not of this Earth.
CONOR: You know me home. Me name.
ROMIREZ: It was time for our paths to cross.
