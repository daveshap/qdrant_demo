SEYMOUR: I have to admit, things have really started looking up for me since my life turned to shit.
THERAPIST: So tell me more about this job. What exactly will you be doing?
SEYMOUR: Well, mostly archival research, cataloguing old records and writing liner notes for their CD reissues. It's really... I can't believe it.
THERAPIST: Remember what I said when we first started -- this little breakdown might turn out to be the best thing that ever happened to you!
SEYMOUR: It doesn't pay very much, but I should be able to afford my own place in a few months... Do you think that's too soon? I'm really anxious to get my record collection out of storage...
THERAPIST: Why don't we start with that next week?
SEYMOUR: Thank you, doctor.
THERAPIST: Don't thank me. You're doing all the work.
THERAPIST: Seymour?
SEYMOUR: Yes?
THERAPIST: Do you have a check for me?
