DAE feel dumber because of their depression?
I feel like I've gotten so much dumber since my depression got severe. I've always been a sort of high functioning depressive but it got really bad around two years ago. Now I struggle with speech a lot and sometimes can't remember simple words or I'll say the wrong word that's not even a word. Like the other day I was talking to a classmate and I said "squibble" instead of "scribble". Facepalm, I know. It was pretty dumb. I used to be so articulate. :( 

EDIT: thanks everyone for the responses and words of encouragement. Feels great to know I'm not alone (not that I'm happy you are affected similarly but its comforting to know I'm not the only one). I don't want to be depressed anymore. If anyone is interested in being a sort of accountability buddy to encourage each other to be better, please PM me. I am trying to get out of my depression naturally since pills really affect my memory. Anyone out there doing the same? Let me know please. :)
