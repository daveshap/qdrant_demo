sp_blitzfirst results to table on a linked server I have been all over looking for the solution to logging sp_blitzfirst results to table on a linked server. I see github posts where a contributor was adding this to sp_blitz, but that's been closed for a while. I see vague rumblings that this might already be in sp_blitzfirst, but am ready to be punished for my inability to find the solution on my own.Can someone point me to a definitive answer?
