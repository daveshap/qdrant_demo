TONY: ...You moved too, didn't you?
LEON: Yeah.
TONY: Huh!? Because of the slaughter at your same floor?
LEON: ...Not at all.
TONY: It's better... You see, it's my turf, so I don't want contracts I'm not informed about, on my turf. I'm not opposing, but the least they can do is informing me, isn't it?
LEON: Yes.
TONY: At a certain moment I thought: maybe Leon would like working on his own? So he makes some little extras?
LEON: Dirty work, and I kill no women and no kids.
TONY: That's what I later told myself! No, Tony, forget Leon! It can't be him, he likes too much his job to make such a slaughter!
LEON: Tell me... The money I earn and you keep for me...
TONY: Do you need money?
LEON: No... Just to know... Because it's a long time I work... And I never did anything with my money... I should do something.
