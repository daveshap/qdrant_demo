Advice for a sleepy scientist?
Hi everyone and thank you for your time. I'm not lazy, and I'm not dramatic. I just need a lot more rest than other people. I have OCD and an organ defect. I used to work as an environmental consultant. There were days in which I would fall asleep driving. I usually blow right through my sick days and fear that people lose confidence in me. However, my work has always been good. I'm back in school now doing a master's degree so that I can manage conservation or restoration programs or projects. I need to know what I should be aiming for. Is there any realistic type of job besides trying to be my own boss that meets the following criteria?

Work from home office/I decide when to come in
Not paid by the hour
Flexible schedule
Nonprofit
No boss or boss's boss breathing down my neck/tracking everything I do

I just want to be in control of my own life. I'm done sacrificing my health and well-being for corporate bullshit.
