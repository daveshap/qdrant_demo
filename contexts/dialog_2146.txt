KATKA: I think I'm stupid.....All you do is use me and expect me to wait for you.
DOUG: No.
KATKA: I thought you loved me Doug but all you want from me is sex.
DOUG: That's not true, we have a great time together. I've said I'm sorry. Let's forget about it and go stop by my place, so I can get changed.
KATKA: Oh sure and you will want sex, always sex.
KATKA: I could have my choice of many boyfriends and go to movies and discos but I waste my time waiting for you and then going to stupid pubs.
DOUG: I'm not a bloody teenager okay, I told you I can't do that shit.
KATKA: That's it, I am just stupid teenager, yes?
DOUG: Right now, yeah - you're talking crap.
