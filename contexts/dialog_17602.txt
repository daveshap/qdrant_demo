ROPER: I know how you feel, Ray.
RAYMOND: You don't know shit, and I suggest you leave.
ROPER: I can't leave, Ray. It's part of my negotiator's oath. Once I'm in the room with the hostage, I have to stay.
RAYMOND: You don't want to see what I'm going to do to her.
ROPER: Let me show you something, Ray.
ROPER: Same thing happened to me, man. She cheated on me, but I forgave her. You know why?
RAYMOND: I ain't interested in your life story.
ROPER: Because I was partially to blame. I wasn't around as much as I should have been. I forgot how to love her.
RAYMOND: She's the one to blame. Not me.
ROPER: Ray, think about how she looked when you married her. Think about how happy you were. Don't lose that, man. Don't give up everything.
RAYMOND: What am I giving up? I'm laid off last year. I'm down to my last unemployment check. I'm out on the streets looking for work and this bitch is banging some asshole in my bed.
