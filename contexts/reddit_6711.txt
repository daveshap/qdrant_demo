Is it customary to write a thank-you e-mail after a phone screen/introductory call?
(The time has passed for this, but) I was contacted by a senior recruiter for a job maybe 1-2 weeks ago. Interviews would start next week; haven't heard back. There are a few reasons why that could be, but I'm wondering if I should've followed that up with an e-mail thanking her for her time.

Also, are phone screens really that effective? They give me false hopes as a prospective employee :(
