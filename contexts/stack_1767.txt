dc voltage control for LED lights? I'm looking for a little bit of help on a project I'm working on. I need to find some way to make led light bars (18w and 120w) to automatically start out dim and gradually brighten to full brightness over a few seconds when they get power and turn on. They are activated by a infrared motion activated switch and ran off of a car battery. It's for night hunting lights and I need the function to keep from spooking animals when the green lights suddenly turn on. I've shot one wild hog with it, but I want to make it even better. I need it to be waterproof simple and something I can integrate easily into my current build. Any ideas?
