Do the FISA documents on Carter Page released today the Department of Justice show evidence of improper surveillance?
It has been [argued by Republicans that the FISA warrants on Carter Page were issued inappropriately,](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/02/us/politics/trump-fbi-memo.html) and were approved as a measure to harm the Trump campaign. This was outlined in the [Nunes memo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nunes_memo) from earlier this year. 

Democrats [argue the warrants were approved appropriately](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/24/us/politics/democratic-memo-released-fbi-surveillance-carter-page.html?action=click&module=RelatedCoverage&pgtype=Article&region=Footer) and this is really an attempt to undermine any investigation into the Trump campaign. 

In accordance with a Freedom of Information request made by the NY Times and others, the Justice Department [released FISA documents](https://int.nyt.com/data/documenthelper/95-carter-page-fisa-documents-foia-release/full/optimized.pdf)(PDF warning) relating to the surveillance of Carter Page.

Do these documents show evidence of improper surveillance, or was the surveillance warranted? 

--------------------------------


Edit: additionally, the President has weighed in on the release, claiming the [documents show the DOJ is rigged and the FBI misled the courts](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1020978929736265729), and that his [campaign was illegally surveilled.](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1020984152357777408) 

As a follow up question to Trump's tweets, are the President's comments on the release accurate?
