MAX: You haven't slept with her, have you?
WILLIAM: That is a cheap question and the answer is, of course, no comment.
MAX: 'No comment' means 'yes.'
WILLIAM: No, it doesn't.
MAX: Do you ever masturbate?
WILLIAM: Definitely no comment.
MAX: You see -- it means 'yes.'
BERNIE: So tell me Anna -- what do you do?
ANNA: I'm an actress.
BERNIE: Splendid. I'm actually in the stock- market, so not really similar fields, though I have done some amateur stuff -- P.G. Wodehouse, you know -- farce, all that. 'Ooh -- careful there, vicar.' Always imagined it's a pretty tough job, though, acting. I mean the wages are a scandal, aren't they?
ANNA: Well, they can be.
BERNIE: I see friends from university -- clever chaps -- been in the business longer than you -- they're scraping by on seven, eight thousand a year. It's no life. What sort of acting do you do?
ANNA: Films mainly.
BERNIE: Oh splendid. Well done. How's the pay in movies? I mean, last film you did, what did you get paid?
ANNA: Fifteen million dollars.
BERNIE: Right. Right. So that's... fairly good. On the high side... have you tried the nuts?
