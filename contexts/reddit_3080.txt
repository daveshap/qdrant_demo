Going back to school for tech at age 30?
Plumber making $65hr wife is a nurse and will cover all the bills. Bachelors software engineering will take 2.5yrs. Tired of plumbing. Will I make more in the long run? Or should I just suck it up and save?

The school is San Jose state uni. I’ve already done 2years at a community college and I’ll only have 2.5 years left. I’m only putting in 8hours a day. What are long hours in tech? I’m just tired of physical work and looking long term for physical health. Plumbing is not that stressful.  I just rather have an office w all the perks. Desk/chair/events/ decent food/ real bathrooms/ clean environment not like a loud dirty construction site. Trying to figure out if tech salary and benefits will put me ahead in the long run
