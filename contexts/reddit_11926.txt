I want to self harm, but I can't because boyfriend and being an adult now.
I did write an essay, but reddit fucked up and I cba to re-write it all. 

The long and short of it is that I used to hurt myself a lot, including cutting and starving. Went through 4 years of ED therapy and finally got well. 

My best friend and therapy buddy is drifting away from me due to us growing up and living our lives and it's making me really really sad to see. I can feel myself hating that our differing opinions just drives the wedge even further.

I feel full to the brim with emotion but I don't know how to deal with it - I've tried talking to her and it just doesn't seem to get us anywhere. 

I just needed to write this because I'm battling with my demons. I know that I won't hurt myself because I would hate for my boyfriend to see the marks and think that he had done something to make me feel sad - he's wonderful and doesn't deserve that. 

I'm just struggling to breath at the moment. Self harm seems so ridiculously appealing, even though I can already feel the post-cutting embarrassment. I'm fucking 22 and should be done with all of that bit of my life.
