ED: Hi. Is Shari here?
RITA: No.
ED: What is she, at work?
RITA: She left.
ED: Well, when will she be back?
RITA: She won't.
ED: What are you talking about?
RITA: She left. She moved. She got Fed-Ex to give her a transfer and she left. She couldn't stand it anymore. We had people, news people, regular people, just sleeping in our hallway, going through our mail, our garbage. I mean it was she couldn't take it anymore. Now I've got to move. I can't afford this place by myself.
ED: I'm sorry. Where'd they send her?
RITA: She wouldn't tell me.
