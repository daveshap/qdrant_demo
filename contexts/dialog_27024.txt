LUKE: Modelling small-group dynamics in the formation of narrative hallucinations. You brought us here to scare us. Insomnia, that was just a decoy issue. You're disgusting.
NELL: Is this true? I've been hypnotized?
MARROW: I hadn't done a study of how group fear affects individual performance. Mass hysteria is like a story, Nell. A communal story. Someone starts it. Then we all add a little more to it. And then for some reason -- no one knows how -- we start believing it. This story shapes what we see and hear. We interpret everything through it, make it fit the story. I started our story when I gave you the history of Hill House. You've added to it. That's what this experiment has all been about. That's what it was about, the experiment's over. I'm pulling the plug. This is my fault.
NELL: It's not real? Crain? He's not real?
MARROW: Your fear of him was real. That's all the ghost anyone needs.
THEO: How could you do this to people?
NELL: This is real, I'm not making it up! Theo, you saw it! You were there -- the banging and last night. You, you all saw the painting!
THEO: Nell, it makes sense. It all makes sense. You and I, we were scaring each other, working each other up.
NELL: -- but the painting!
MARROW: Why would we want to do that, Nell?
NELL: Because that's where he burned them up, the child laborers from his mills! Because that's where their bones are! He killed <i>hundreds</i>. He took them here and he killed them. Their bones are in the fireplace!
