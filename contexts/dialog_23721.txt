PARKINS: Want me to breathe deeply?
ST. LUC: Just breathe normally.
PARKINS: Good shape for an old man, eh?
ST. LUC: Mr. Parkins, what makes you think you caught these lumps of yours from a young lady?
PARKINS: She had a couple just like them. Right here near her belly button. You could push 'em around. I thought they were kinda sexy, myself.
ST. LUC: Didn't she ever have these lumps looked at by a doctor?
PARKINS: Didn't seem worried about them.
ST. LUC: Was this girl from Starliner Towers?
PARKINS: Yep. She lived in 1208. But we usually went to my place. Bigger liquor cabinet, bigger bed. She was gone when I got back from my last Florida trip. Too bad. Had a beautiful tan. Must have gone home to mother.
ST. LUC: Was her name Annabelle Horsefield?
PARKINS: That's the one.
