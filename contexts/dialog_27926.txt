JERRY: You know Charlie How-Come?
GALBRAITH: We're old friends.
GALBRAITH: Come to look around?
JERRY: More or less.
GALBRAITH: I'll take you about. Got some nice things.
JERRY: Charlie and I were talking. That's one reason I wanted to see you.
GALBRAITH: About Charlie's leopard?
JERRY: Yes.
GALBRAITH: Here is something that should interest Charlie - a stone leopard head made by his ancestors some six hundred years ago. They used it in ceremonies. The jaguar -- in fact all the cat family -- were considered the personification of force and violence in their religious rites.
CHARLIE: It don't look like a leopard to me.
JERRY: Charlie doesn't think the leopard killed the girl in the cemetery.
GALBRAITH: Charlie likes his leopard.
CHARLIE: Sure, I like my leopards
JERRY: But he admitted quick enough that it killed the first girl.
GALBRAITH: Well, Charlie, just why do you think your cat didn't kill the Contreras girl?
CHARLIE: You know -- not scared enough. Nothing to scare it.
GALBRAITH: If a leopard didn't do it, who did?
JERRY: It could be a man.
GALBRAITH: It could be. Why would a man kill her? For what? It wasn't robbery. It wasn't a crime of jealousy or passion. She had no enemies.
JERRY: There are all sorts of men. You get to see some funny ones as a reporter.
GALBRAITH: I can understand what you mean - demented men, pathological cases. But what sort of man would kill like a leopard and leave the traces of a leopard?
JERRY: Some crazy guy.
GALBRAITH: But he would have to know about leopards - have access to leopard claws and hair.
