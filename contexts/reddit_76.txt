is my dad sexually abusing my brother
i have had such an odd feeling around my little brother (7) and my dad. but my mom went out of town this weekend and i caught my dad and brother in the bathroom with the door locked. it took them a minute to get the door open and it just hasn’t sat with my right. now since my mom is gone my brother is sleeping w my dad in his bed and it sits with me badly too. there have been other situations where i thought there was something wrong happening between them but i always drop it because it’s my dad and we go to church so why would he. than i started reading signs of sexually abuse children and my brother 
- HATES taking off his clothes (even for showers or changing)
- my dad has always favorited my brother buying him treats. taking him places alone 
- my brother has huge anxiety mainly social and he’s 7

i don’t know i just can’t figure out why a 48 old year man would lock himself in a bathroom with a 7 year old.
