A running list of university closures and actions in response to COVID-19. How is your work changing?
We're up to two dozen US universities and college campuses that have either suspended classes or relocated a bulk of in-person classes to online/distance learning. Some locations have cancelled classes for a few days or a week; others have done so indefinitely or until the end of the current semester or quarter. I'll keep a running list here if there's any interest.

It appears in most cases, classes are cancelled or altered, but offices are remaining open. Student events are being cancelled, air travel and international travel cancelled or advised against, but staff are still working. Can any SA professionals share how their university's actions are changing their day-to-day job?

As per CDC guidelines [here](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/student-foreign-travel.html) and [here](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/guidance-ihe-response.html), most institutions have imposed restrictions and guidelines on international travel that includes canceling or postponing some or all international travel. Many universities are also employing restrictions on university-sponsored domestic air travel. Many institutions are also recommending students, staff, faculty, and others to follow guidelines from the CDC and stay home when sick, wash and sanitize hands properly, self-quarantine following exposure to known infected individuals or onset of respiratory symptoms. For the sake of simplicity, the list below is only inclusive of institution closures and alterations of academic coursework.
