How much idleness would you tolerate before start searching for another job?
In my 20 years experience, whenever I feel under-utilized I became worried and usually started looking for a new job. It happened three times already when I practically didn't do anything for 3 months or more. I think I'm in the same situation now. I haven't done anything significant/meaningful in almost 6 months. My (former) boss quit 3 months ago. He also told me he was "pushed out". My new boss told me he'll come up with some plans for the team, but it has been 3 months since he took over, and still no concrete plan. 

I know this situation is not uncommon, especially with big companies. Also many of my coworkers are in similar situation , but they don't seem to be bothered much. Some of them are actually enjoying it. The company I am working for is a multi-billion company that has been making net-profits around 100 million each quarter, but that does not mean they won't layoff people if they think they could increase profit.
