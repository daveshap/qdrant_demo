PRIEST: I heard about your sister, and I... understand your pain...
JEANNE: Why did she have to die?
PRIEST: Only God knows the answer to that.
JEANNE: I know Jesus says to love our enemies but I can't -- I just want the English to burn in hell for ever and ever!
PRIEST: I realize your anger, Jeanne, but we must learn to forgive. It's hard, but revenge will never bring about peace.
JEANNE: Then what will? And what will bring her back? And why did she have to die in the first place instead of me? Why didn't he take my life instead of hers? It was my fault -- I was late -- she gave me her hiding place...!!
PRIEST: Jeanne... calm down...! Calm down, Jeanne!
