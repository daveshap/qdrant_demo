KIRK: Physician, heal thyself.
BONES: That's all you have to say?
KIRK: I'm not a drama critic.
KIRK: Well, Mr. Saavik, are you going to stay with the sinking ship?
SAAVIK: Permission to speak candidly, sir?
KIRK: Very well.
SAAVIK: I don't believe this was a fair test of my command capabilities.
KIRK: And why not?
SAAVIK: Because... there was no way to win.
KIRK: A no-win situation is a possibility every commander may face. Has that never occurred to you?
SAAVIK: ... No, sir. It has not.
KIRK: How we deal with death is at least as important as how we deal with life, wouldn't you say?
SAAVIK: As I indicated, Admiral, that thought had not occurred to me.
KIRK: Then you have something new to think about. Carry on.
BONES: Wouldn't it be easier to put an experienced crew back on the ship?
KIRK: They'll learn. Galloping about the cosmos is a game for the young, doctor.
