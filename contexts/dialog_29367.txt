MR. POTATO HEAD: Did you all take stupid pills this morning?! Have you forgotten what he did to Buzz? And now you want to let him back over here?
WOODY: No, no, no! You got it all wrong, Potato Head. Buzz is fine! Buzz is right here. He's with me!
MR. POTATO HEAD: You are a liar!
WOODY: No, I'm not! Buzz, come over here and you just tell the nice toys that you're not dead.
