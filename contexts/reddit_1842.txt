Stuck on your essay? Here's a psychological trick
Early Decision deadlines are coming up and I've started to see people talking about being stuck on their essays.  In the next two weeks this will reach epidemic proportions.

I get it. This is important and you want it to be perfect.  Some of you haven't even started, or have a hundred false starts and they all seem to suck.  You stare at the blank page and nothing seems like it is going to work.  You've done your homework and read a lot about the things that you shouldn't say in your essay and every time you write something it seems like a cliche, or pretentious, or unappealing.  Your parents and teachers are nagging but you just can't find the words.

One trick that I have seen working is to set out to deliberately write the world's worst essay.  Go ahead!  Swear, use jargon, brag, be stupid, be silly, be trite, be a stereotype, be pretentious, be obnoxious, be mean, be petty.  Just sit down and get it all out of your system.  

Once you start keep on writing until you run out of momentum.  Then put that aside and do something physical for 20 minutes to an hour.  Dance, go for a walk, rake the leaves, clean your room, do yoga, whatever.  Just do something that gets your blood moving and doesn't need your brain.  Once that's done, pick your joke essay back up and read it out loud.  Do funny voices if they fit.  

You could find that once you've gotten the bad writing out of your system, the good writing is hiding right behind it.  Or you could find a phrase or sentence in the terrible essay that sparks a thought and leads to a really great essay.

For extra bonus points, when your parents nag you about your essay progress give them the terrible essay and pretend you think that it's good.
