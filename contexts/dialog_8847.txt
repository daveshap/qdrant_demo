KINDERMAN: Strange...strange...so baffling. The deceased comes to visit, stays only twenty minutes, and leaves all alone a very sick girl. And speaking plainly Mrs. MacNeil, as you say, it's not likely he would fall from a window. Besides that, a fall wouldn't do to his neck what we found except maybe a chance in a thousand. My hunch? My opinion? I believe he was killed by a very powerful man: point one. And the fracturing of the skull - point two - plus the various things I have mentioned, would make it very probable - probable, not certain - that the deceased was killed and then pushed from your daughter's window. But no-one was here except your daughter. So how could this be? It could be one way: if someone came calling between the time Miss Spencer left and the time you returned. The servants, they have visitors?
CHRIS: No. Not at all,
KINDERMAN: You were expecting a deliver y that day?
CHRIS: Not that I know of.
KINDERMAN: Groceries maybe? A package?
CHRIS: I really wouldn't know, you see Karl takes care of that.
KINDERMAN: Oh, I see.
CHRIS: Want to ask him?
KINDERMAN: Never mind.
CHRIS: Would you like some more coffee?
KINDERMAN: Please.
