GITTES: Maid's night off?
EVELYN: Why?
GITTES: What do you mean, 'why?' Nobody's here, that's all.
EVELYN: I gave everybody the night off.
GITTES: Easy, it's an innocent question.
EVELYN: No question from you is innocent, Mr. Gittes.
GITTES: I guess not to you, Mrs. Mulwray. Frankly you really saved my a... my neck tonight.
EVELYN: Tell me something. Does this usually happen to you, Mr. Gittes?
GITTES: What's that, Mrs. Mulwray?
EVELYN: Well, I'm only judging on the basis of one afternoon and an evening, but if that's how you go about your work, I'd say you're lucky to get through a whole day.
GITTES: Actually this hasn't happened to me in some time.
EVELYN: When was the last time?
GITTES: Why?
EVELYN: Just. I don't know why. I'm asking.
GITTES: It was in Chinatown.
EVELYN: What were you doing there?
GITTES: Working for the District Attorney.
EVELYN: Doing what?
GITTES: As little as possible.
EVELYN: The District Attorney gives his men advice like that?
GITTES: They do in Chinatown.
