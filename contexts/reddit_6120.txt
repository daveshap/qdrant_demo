Should I go to work or stay home?
I'm an installer for this company and every day I do work in people's homes and occasionally business. This whole week I been off because of Corona and now I got a text from my boss saying that were working next week. 

I'm not sure if I should go in or not. My company has been trying to play it safe. They passed out hand sanitizer and gloves, forcing everyone to wash their hands, wiping down tools and other equipment, enforcing the 6ft rule, and they call our customers to make sure if it's ok before we come and most of them say yes.

I live in Missouri and the number of cases are going up and I'm afraid of getting it from someone who probably doesn't know that they have it. I live with my father who is 65 and I'm more afraid of him getting it than me. I been trying to take social distancing seriously and so has my dad. 

So what should I do? I want to work but at the same time I want to be safe. The worst case scenario is I lose my job. If that happens I will be fine for 6 months or so.
