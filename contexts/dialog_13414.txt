BETSY: Why was the maid crying?
HOLLAND: I'm not sure I can make you understand. You know what this is?
BETSY: A figure of St. Sebastian.
HOLLAND: Yes. But it was once the figurehead of a slave ship. That's where our people came from -- from the misery and pain of slavery. For generations they found life a burden. That's why they still weep when a child is born -- and make merry at a burial.
