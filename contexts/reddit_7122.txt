How to best identify tech companies in the startup (post funding) phase
I'm an experienced Director of Sales and Operations.  

After increasing the revenue of my last company by over 700% I never anticipated that I would have been so successful in doing what I do that my CEO would have a mental breakdown and shutter the company - simply due to work overload.  (This was with a Government Contracting company run by a Disabled Veteran. - Guess I should have seen that coming.)

Anyway, I'm damn good at identifying and creating corporate partnerships, and well versed in Government Sales and Contracting.  I'm also highly attracted to new start-up type companies which have a good product/service which could be utilized by the US Government in some capacity.

I would like to build an database of funded start-up companies which have either a SaaS software, or a product offering that I could join the team as their Director of Business Development (or similar) while helping to build a Government Sales push within the company.

My question is, how the hell do I identify start-up companies that are searching for a West Coast (Nevada) or remote Business Dev role, are funded, and have a well received product or software app?  I've gone through AngelList, VirtualVocations and all the standard job search databases, but those are just for companies who are actively looking for a specific position.  I'm wanting to identify and target startups that may not realize what it is they need yet.

Any advice on this?
