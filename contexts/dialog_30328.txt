MADELEINE: No!... No!
SCOTTIE: Tell me what it is. Where do you go? What takes you away?
MADELEINE: No, don't ask me!
SCOTTIE: When you jumped in the bay, you didn't know where you were. You guessed but you didn't know.
MADELEINE: I didn't jump, I fell! You told me I fell!
SCOTTIE: Why did you jump?
MADELEINE: No!
SCOTTIE: What was it inside that told you to jump?
MADELEINE: No, I can't tell you!
SCOTTIE: What?!
MADELEINE: No! Please! Please, please, please, please, don't ask me!
MADELEINE: Take me away from here?
SCOTTIE: Home?
MADELEINE: ...somewhere in the light.
