How to avoid recruiters/agencies who ghost candidates?
I'm trying not to get frustrated with recruiters, as I'm in the early stages of my search after a postgrad degree, but it's getting increasingly difficult. I'm getting a few initial screening calls, which is positive, but during every call, they promise to send me the job spec right away and I never hear from them again. 

Is this common practice with recruiters? Or is this a sign I'm really bombing my screening interviews? I'd be much happier if they just straight up said I'm not a good fit for the role instead of promising something they know they won't do. I understand that recruiters need to make their call KPIs but I don't see the point in lying to candidates.

Not sure if job field/location is relevant, but I'm in analytics in based in Dublin.
