Is a $12,000/year stipend for PhD reasonable?
Hi all, my question is in the title, but for those of you who'd like more info, please read on.

I finished a M.S. in engineering back in May and I'm taking a year off. Recently, I began applying for jobs and PhD positions. A few days ago, I was talking with a professor at a Canadian university (I'm from the US) who was looking for a PhD student to work on a project that was a perfect fit for my interests and background. I asked what the stipend was, and they told me it was $12,000/year, which they said was "competitive." I asked if most PhD students have second jobs, or if there is cheap/free on-campus housing for PhD students, and the prof said no to both.

Now, I had two main issues with that.

* My partner and I were already struggling on $40,000/year (collectively) as master's students, with both of us studying at the same time. If my partner couldn't find a job in Canada, I don't know how we would survive on $12,000/year.
* That's $1,000/month. Basically I'd pay rent, utilities, and groceries, and I'm mostly out of money.

Where I did my bachelor's and master's degrees PhD students are paid around $30,000/year. What is a normal stipend? I can't imagine $12,000/year is livable, but maybe I'm coddled.

ETA: Thanks, all, this has been informative. I'm gonna pass on this opportunity - I was on the fence about going back to school already. I think I'll take a few years off before I go back to get my PhD somewhere that's not this school.
