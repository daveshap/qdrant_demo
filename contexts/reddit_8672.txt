Is there an inherent incompatibility between stable government and responsive government?
[Political stability](https://www.state.gov/s/d/rm/rls/dosstrat/2004/23504.htm) is often cited as a [goal](https://europa.eu/european-union/about-eu/eu-in-brief_en) in governmental systems. But some of the most stable systems, like long-standing dictatorships, [are the least responsive to the needs of the people.](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11127-008-9391-x)

Is it possible to have stable governments that are also responsive? What are some examples of those? What characteristics do those governments share that could be adopted by countries whose people want more responsive government?
