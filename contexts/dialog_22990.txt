CINDY: Morphine? chloroform? Horse tranquilizers? You've drugged him!
HANSON: No, actually, I found him like this. That's his stuff.
HANSON: Sit down and join us, Cindy.
SHORTY: Yeah, I always wanted to watch you eat.
CINDY: She'd have to be really pretty and I'd have to be very drunk.
SHORTY: I'm going to work in Washington, Cindy.
CINDY: Are you?
SHORTY: That's where my best customers are. Marion Berry, George Bush, the Redskins. I'd like to offer you a job, Cindy. Can you type? Take dictation? Swallow balloons filled with cocaine?
HANSON: Now you're being rude, Shorty.
SHORTY: Washington is full of cornpone country pussy -- just ask Jesse Jackson.
