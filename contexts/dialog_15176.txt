KAFKA: All these in the last year?
KEEPER: You must have read about it in the papers -- there was a terrible cave-in. It wouldn't have been so bad, but even the Medical Officer for the district was killed!
KAFKA: I did read that. They gave him a posthumous medal.
KEEPER: Dr. Murnau was the bravest of men. He spent an entire career in those backwaters with no regard for personal gain. A great loss.
KAFKA: This is the cross-reference of clerks who've worked on Orlac claims?
KEEPER: Is your friend's name among them? Then he only worked on the one case. Your Chief will send me the final summation when he's finished with it.
KAFKA: Once a file's been sent to the Caste, is it possible to recall it for review?
KEEPER: Of course not. Only by a Director of the firm. Who'd want to let in all kinds of riff-raff off the streets?
KAFKA: What good are records if they're not open for public inspection?
KEEPER: These laws have been with us for centuries -- how can you doubt them?
KAFKA: What if I petitioned one of the Directors?
KEEPER: You do not summon them -- they summon you -- and this, of course, hardly ever happens, if at all. The Directors are an eccentric lot and by nature cautious.
KAFKA: Where do our records go to in the Castle?
KEEPER: We're a medical firm, aren't we? They go to the Medical Records Section.
KAFKA: I could always apply there.
KEEPER: It so happens, my dear simple sir, that the Head of Medical Records at the Castle <u>is</u> one of the Directors of this firm.
