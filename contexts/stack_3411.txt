Series of omnibuses about a set of 3 kingdoms, at least 1 of which has spirit animals/animal companions In this series the first set of omnibuses is about is about a female protagonist who has the bloodline of two of the kingdoms. One of the kingdoms has animal companions that are linked by birth to them when they're born, and only the linked person can communicate with them mentally. However, the protagonist, due to their bloodlines, is able to talk with any companion mentally. Eventually she marries someone from the final bloodline and her child is the perfect being and has a lion as their spirit animal. I don't remember whether the protagonist has an animal companion or not. I believe at one point she develops amnesia (which is how she meets the people of the 3rd bloodline, and is whom she marries in the future), prior to this she had a relationship with someone from the other 2 bloodlines. I may be wrong about it being just one female protagonist up to this point, the female protagonist might have married someone from the first two bloodlines and have had a daughter/son who marries into the third and gives birth to the super baby.I believe one kingdom lived in the forest (the one with spirit animals/animal companions), and the others on either side of the forest, maybe having a border the met outside the forest as well.I read this about 10-13 years ago, and is not the Astor Chronicles. The book themselves seemed relatively new at the time ( &lt; 2 years old), however since it was an omnibus of books, that means the original series had likely been out for around > 5 years at that point.
