How do I interpret an RGB LED max amperage given as a range e.g. 30mA-70mA? I have some LED's I got in a mixed package and the RGB LEDs instead of a single max amperage just list a range.  One example is I have a common cathode RGB LED with ratings listed as 1.9-3.4v and 30mA-75mA.  I've been interpreting the V range as the lowest forward V of the red to the max Vf of the green and blue elements.Should I assume that like with the Vf the red element likely has the lower 30mA rating while green and blue have the 75mA rating, or do I assume that 30mA is the lower end of the functional range of the all 3 elements and 75mA is the max?  Nothing burns out when running I run it briefly at 60mA to all colors and no issues.Mostly I'm wondering what the standard practice is for interpreting these values when they are listed this way.Thanks in advance. Edit/New info Based on a great link from anrieff I've tried playing around some with the bulb in question.  At below a total draw of 30mA the color balance of the bulb starts to shift from a cool white to the green.  This brings up another issue, since the draw at 30mA would be 10mA per color element, does that mean the upper 70mA limit should be treated as a total instead of an upper limit per color element.  i.e. ~23mA per color element for a total of 70mA instead of the 70mA per color I was originally thinking?
