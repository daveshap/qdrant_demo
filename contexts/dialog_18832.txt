THOMAS J: Hey look at this!
VADA: That was Grammoo's. It's a phrenology chart, they used to study the bumps in your head to see if you had a good personality or not. Come here, i'll diagnose your head.
THOMAS J: No, I don't wanna.
VADA: Come on, it's fun.
VADA: Hmmmm, interesting.
THOMAS J: What?
VADA: You have no personality.
THOMAS J: Hey, where does it say that?
VADA: Never mind.
THOMAS J: Is that your Dad?
VADA: Yes.
THOMAS J: Who's that with your Dad?
VADA: It's my mother.
THOMAS J: Do you remember her?
VADA: No. Grammoo said she's in heaven.
THOMAS J: What do you think it's like?
VADA: What?
THOMAS J: Heaven.
VADA: I think, everybody gets their own white horse, and all they do is ride and eat marshmallows all day, and everybody's best friends with everybody else, when you play sports, there's no teams, so nobody gets picked last.
THOMAS J: But, what if you're afraid to ride horses?
VADA: It doesn't matter, 'cause they're not regular horses, they got wings, and it's no big deal if you fall, you just land in cloud.
THOMAS J: That doesn't sound so bad, come on, we'll never find that streamer.
