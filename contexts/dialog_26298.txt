GEORGE: You sure are a good cook, Selena. Man, that looks too pretty to eat.
SELENA: Better eat it quick. It won't look too pretty when it's all covered with ants.
GEORGE: Selena, I've been thinking. It's time I settled down---and I don't know a nicer lady to settle down with than you.
SELENA: Why George, are you proposing?
GEORGE: Marry me, Selena. The hardware store doesn't bring in much now, but...
SELENA: George---I thought you'd never ask.
