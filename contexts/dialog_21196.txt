KILLAINE: You've got a dead man on your hands. You killed jim--even if it wasn't murder. What are you going to do about it?
GORE: If I've got any sense I'm going to call headquarters.
KILLAINE: They'll probably believe you. But they'll want to know what you were fighting about. Why Mitchell had a gun. You'll tell them a simple story. They'll pretend it sounds all right to them. Now you're headquarters. How does it sound to you?
GORE: Before I took the story and closed the case, I'd want to know a lot more about these people. I'd want to know just about everything about them.
KILLAINE: Exactly. Now I'm the killer. And there's something I don't want you to know. Something that would destroy my comfortable life, rob me of my friends, my position.
GORE: Such as?
KILLAINE: Assume there is something to hid. I go to a lot of trouble. What do I do? What would you do?
GORE: Do I know who lives down there?
KILLAINE: You can find out.
GORE: Do I know that she's out of the room? Likely to be out of it for some time?
KILLAINE: You can find out the first part. The second part you have to take a chance on.
GORE: Pretty big chance, huh?
KILLAINE: You've got a dead man on your hands. Like this.
