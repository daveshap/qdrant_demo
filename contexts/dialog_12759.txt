HILDY: You're repeating yourself! That's the speech you made the night you proposed. -- any time -- any place -- anywhere!""
BURNS: I notice you still remember it.
HILDY: I'll always remember it. If I hadn't remembered it, I wouldn't have divorced you.
BURNS: You know, Hildy, I sort of wish you hadn't done it.
HILDY: Done what?
BURNS: Divorced me. It sort of makes a fellow lose faith in himself. It almost gives him a feeling he wasn't wanted.
HILDY: Holy mackerel! Look, Walter, that's what divorces are for.
BURNS: Nonsense. You've got the old-fashioned idea that divorces are something that last forever -- till 'death us do part'. Why, a divorce doesn't mean anything today. It's only a few words mumbled over you by a judge. We've got something between us nothing can change.
HILDY: I suppose that's true in a way. I am fond of you, Walter. I often wish you weren't such a stinker.
BURNS: Now, that's a nice thing to say.
HILDY: Well, why did you promise me you wouldn't fight the divorce and then try and gum up the whole works?
BURNS: Well, I meant to let you go -- but, you know, you never miss the water till the well runs dry.
HILDY: A fellow your age, hiring an airplane to write: 'Hildy: Don't be hasty -- remember my dimple. Walter.! It held things up twenty minutes while the Judge ran out to watch it.
BURNS: Well, I don't want to brag, but I've still got the dimple -- and in the same place -- I just acted like any husband who doesn't want to see his home broken up.
HILDY: What home?
