MERLE: Sure I got boots. I got boots right here.
VINCE: Then lemme have 'em.
MERLE: No.
VINCE: No!!!?
MERLE: No.
VINCE: What do you mean, no???
MERLE: That's it. No. No way.
VINCE: Some fuckin' friend... You're some fuckin' friend, Merle!
MERLE: You gotta learn, Vince! You come out here... You got no jacket, you got no pants, you got no knife and you got no boots. You think everyone's gonna take care of you! That's what you always think, but this time you're wrong. This time you're on your own!
