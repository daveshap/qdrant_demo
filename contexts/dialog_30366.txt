LIZ: Why do you feel the need to explore this side of your personality?
FISHER: What are you talking about?
LIZ: I'm talking about the kind of people you hang out with...about growing up, assuming responsibility of yourself.
FISHER: I asked you to marry me. I'm ready for marriage. That's responsibility. That's growth.
LIZ: I just think that at some point you're going to have to re-evaluate some of your friendships...
FISHER: Who else?
LIZ: Charles Moore for instants.
FISHER: You don't like Moore? Since when?
LIZ: It's not that I don't like him. But the wedding has really got me thinking and... I just keep myself opening up. Crowning. And I want you keeping up with me here.
FISHER: What does Moore have to do with your growing?
LIZ: I just don't see him in the big picture.
FISHER: I've known him since Cub Scouts.
LIZ: He's weird.
FISHER: He's quiet.
LIZ: He's weird.
FISHER: He just doesn't talk a lot.
LIZ: Why? What's his problem?
FISHER: He's a great chef.
LIZ: He's weird. And I expect more from you.
FISHER: You expect more what?
LIZ: You're going to be hungover for three days. Like those guys on Oprah" that get drunk and have disgusting sex with prostitutes and then say their vows with the stench of cheap hotel whore sex all over them."
FISHER: Time out.
LIZ: It's vile!
FISHER: That's absurd.
LIZ: I've seen it on television.
FISHER: I'm not going to marry you with the smell of prostitutes on my body.
LIZ: I am not common Keith. I am not common. I am a creature like no other and I will not be commoned! Is that to much to ask? Is that to much to ask!?!
FISHER: You will not be common!!!
