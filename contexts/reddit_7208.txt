Boss says I can’t use my learning disability as a “crutch” for not learning fast enough. What should I do?
So I work at a chain retail store. My hours are usually between 25-34 hours a week plus I have to go to university full time. I’ve been working at the store for about a month now and there’s tons of tasks that vary day to day. Some of them being fairly consistent and some of them being extremely random. I haven’t had a job in 4 years due to raising my baby sister. Because the extremely random jobs are things I haven’t done before my coworkers get annoyed when I ask questions on specifically what to do (the instructions aren’t detailed in any way. If they tell me to go get something from the back it takes me a bit longer because they never tell me somewhat specific location directions and get mad when I don’t know it/take longer to find it). 

I have extremely bad ADD/ADHD depending on my bipolar disorder. I’ve explained to them again and again how I genuinely have a hard time processing terms that I haven’t heard of and it takes me a little bit of time to get the hang of things. Because of this I’ve been told I could potentially get fired because of how bad my learning speed is and that I’m not trying hard enough. 

I’m completely lost as to what I should do. I thought about transferring stores but my manager obviously doesn’t like me in the first place. I was thinking about getting a psychiatrist note but even then they’ll still treat me like a burden.
