Debating on going back to school for a MS in Information Systems - does school necessarily matter?
I’m coming from an unrelated science background and in that field it didn’t really matter as long as you got some sort of experience under your belt. But, I’m just a bit worried about how it’ll look if I go to a program that isn’t well known/ranked for the Information Systems program. I was hoping to get an internship, then an entry level position and move my way up from there. Would the name of the university I go to really hinder me?

Thanks!
