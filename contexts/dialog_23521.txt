WILL: Marlowe's touch was in my Titus Andronicus and my Henry VI was a house built on his foundations.
VIOLA: You never spoke so well of him.
WILL: He was not dead before. I would exchange all my plays to come for all of his that will never come.
VIOLA: You lie.
VIOLA: You lie in your meadow as you lied in my bed.
WILL: My love is no lie. I have a wife, yes, and I cannot marry the daughter of Sir Robert de Lesseps. It needed no wife come from Stratford to tell you that. And yet you let me come to your bed.
VIOLA: Calf love. I loved the writer, and gave up the prize for a sonnet.
WILL: I was the more deceived.
