PAUL: So your mother grew up in Shanghai?
APRIL: Until she was twelve. She moved here in 'forty-nine.
PAUL: And your father? Is he from New York?
APRIL: Muncie, Indiana. He and my mother met as students. But I'm from Brooklyn. My sisters and I were all born and bred right here.
PAUL: Just like me.
RASHID: Like me, too.
APRIL: I once read somewhere that one quarter of all the people in the United States have at least one relative who has lived in Brooklyn at one time or another.
RASHID: No wonder it's such a screwed-up place.
PAUL: And the bookstore? Have you been working there long?
APRIL: It's just a summer job. Something to help pay the bills while I finish my dissertation.
PAUL: Your dissertation? What subject do you study?
APRIL: American literature. What else?
PAUL: What else. Of course, what else? And what are you writing about for your thesis?
APRIL: Visions of Utopia in Nineteenth-Century American Fiction.
PAUL: Wow. You don't fool around, do you?
APRIL: Of course I fool around. But not so much when it comes to my work, it's true. Have you ever read Pierre, or the Ambiguities?
PAUL: Melville, huh? It's been a while.
APRIL: That's the subject of my last chapter.
PAUL: Not an easy book.
APRIL: Which explains why this hasn't been the easiest summer of my life.
