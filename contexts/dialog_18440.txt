MRS. MEREDITH: Come in, please. Come in. Can I get you a cup of tea?
CEDAR: No, thanks.
MRS. MEREDITH: Sit down. Sure I couldn't get you a glass of lemonade or something?
CEDAR: That's very kind of you. Are you related to him?
MRS. MEREDITH: No, I'm his housekeeper.
CEDAR: Well, we'd like to find out something about him. What does he do for a living?
MRS. MEREDITH: He and Jim Mason own the Tallow Works. But that's not where he makes his money. He makes most of it from his poetry.
