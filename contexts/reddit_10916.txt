I've lost my son to suicide last week
Hello humanity.

Last Thursday, my son Alex took his own life. He left no note and there was no indication of his intention to do this. Our family came together in this great sorrow.

I would like people to take away light from this event. Alex was 25. He was a beautiful and kind person that knew how to give but had difficulty in receiving.

We, all of us question what more we could have done to bring more love into his life, but we have no answers and we feel a profound sorrow at the loss of  this beautiful man.

Please, I ask that anyone just please take a breath if this is your contemplation and know that you are loved even if in your moment of despair in that dark place. Please find that you are love and that you have love to give in this world. There are still people, perhaps some you have not even met yet that need your love in their own life.

Know you are light and you shine farther than you yourself may be able to perceive. Know this. Take that breath. Find your peace in the love you have and the love you get.

Peace.
