DICKSON: Yes?
HELEN'S VOICE: Mr. Sampson . . .
DICKSON: All right. Send him in.
DICKSON: Well, Sampson, what is it?
SAMPSON: Here's the data on the Clyde deal.
DICKSON: Good. I'll take this along with me. Tell Clyde I'll see him tomorrow. I'm sick and tired of the delay.
SAMPSON: I'm afraid he's been stalling.
DICKSON: That's just exactly what he has been doing. This deal should have been closed weeks ago. Tell him to keep tomorrow open . . .
SAMPSON: He says he can't get away in the daytime.
DICKSON: How about his nights? He's too busy running around. Tell him to keep tomorrow night open, come in and sign this thing, or I'll call this whole deal off.
SAMPSON: Yes, sir.
