ALEXANDER: Is he all right?
MARA: Just a dream. You should sleep too. You're still not well.
MARA: I'm going to sit with Kalen. Keep the fire burning if you can.
ALEXANDER: I will...
MARA: I'll take you to your machine tomorrow.
ALEXANDER: Thank you...
MARA: You seem fascinated by the stars.
ALEXANDER: You can see so many here.
MARA: Don't then have stars where you come from?
ALEXANDER: Not like this... They don't seem so bright with all the city lights. I never really noticed them much...
MARA: Good night, then.
ALEXANDER: Good night.
