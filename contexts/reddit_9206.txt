How I broke the cycle of poverty - Lived on $10,000 a year growing up in the projects to now being middle-class
My post is not intended to be a one-size-fits-all approach. It’s merely a lowly account of how I beat the cycle of poverty. I will mention parts of my personal 30+ year journey as illustrative examples. I’m a very pragmatic person, so I like organizing my points into actionable deliverables and providing practical tips.

I’ve noted common vs. uncommon advice so that it helps you skim / skip. Even for the common advice, it might be worth the read because I’ve attempted to narrow it down to the most useful / impactful ones that worked for me.

&#x200B;

1. **\[Common\] Your greatest asset is your health, don’t overlook it.** I know some of us had to work multiple jobs, myself included.. but I learned this the hard way. Your health should always come first. Without it, you can’t work and you can lose everything.
   1. **Active prevention** \- Eat right, exercise and get an annual physical (if you’re able). You don’t have to pay for a gym - walk 30 minutes a day around your neighborhood at a minimum! A cheap alternative to the gym is the city community center ($30 for the **entire year** in my high cost of living city vs. $30 **a month** at a commercial gym).
   2. **Don’t overwork** \- Each person has his or her own limit, but… don’t take on too much. You can suffer from exhaustion and die from it.
   3. **Keep your mental health in check** \- Talk about your struggles with loved ones, and seek outside help from counselors, a religious leader or even Reddit! Mental health is so important and without it, we can make bad decisions that have irreversible consequences.
2. **\[Uncommon\]** **Sacrifice** \- Unfortunately, living in poverty taught me that it is filled with heavy sacrifices.
   1. **Some social events** \-  I was never able to attend school dances. Why? They cost money and I was barely able to afford clothes. I wore a rotation of 2-3 school outfits the whole school year.  I spent my early twenties busting my @ss off at work to get out of the projects. There was nothing like drive bys during holidays to motivate me to work harder. People who love you, will make time for you, and vice versa. To some, social events are very important. Although it was painful at the time, I don’t have any regrets. 
   2. **Material necessities** \- Having a car is a necessity in my area… and I had to take several hours of bus rides when it could have taken 20-30 minutes by car. As a woman, I was not able to afford beauty products when I was poor. It was tough, but at least there were workarounds...
   3. **Time, effort and sleep** \- Greatest things you’ll have to sacrifice when you don’t have money…
   4. **Dignity** \- Working at the bottom could be one of the most dehumanizing experiences one can face. People use you and treat you like shit. They talk over you, yell at you, tell you you’re not worth it in some form, etc. How I overcame this was by becoming more emboldened and standing up for myself. **DOCUMENT evidence**, my friends. BE VERY SPECIFIC with dates, times, places, quotes, etc. and email it to yourself, should you ever need to use it. Unfortunately, some people just don’t have class, so when they resort to **personal attacks**, I shut it down **immediately** by simply stating that it is below my level of professionalism when someone is unable to stick to the work product. I’m used to having experts nitpicking and tearing apart my analyses… and one of the hardest lessons to learn early in my career was not taking these critiques personally. I used to be afraid to speak up to abusive bosses for fear of losing my job… but I armed myself with knowledge and experience to combat this. So I learned how to argue, come up with counterpoints, poke holes in their logic and reasoning, but most of all - control my emotions and being professional even when others are unprofessional. Don’t get me wrong, I’ve had awesome bosses as well, but early in my career, I’ve had to deal with an inordinate amount of bad ones. Growing up, bullying was common for being poor. I was made fun of for a lot of different reasons, but it taught me to be resilient and enabled me to improve myself.
3. **\[Common\]** **Make friends and network**
   1. I’d say about 33% of the people at a previous firm were hired through friends and/or family. They had a guaranteed interview at a minimum vs. someone submitting a resume had like a 1/100 shot at an interview.
   2. One coworker I had was incredible. She would befriend almost every client we had and was so genuine… She had a personal touch with each person. You better believe she was one of the most amazing people I’ve had the privilege to work with and to learn from.
   3. Networking and making friends allows you to have more job opportunities and tap into a pool of resources. Different people are good at different things. They can help you out in life and vice versa.
4. **\[Common\]** Capitalize on your strengths, minimize your weaknesses and develop yourself.
   1. **Know what your strengths are and cultivate them.** I used to be painfully shy and had trouble speaking to everyone. However, I had to change this in order to get good grades, be gainfully employed and move up the ladder. **Communication skills** are absolutely necessary in order to get ahead in life. The ability to be persuasive and convincing with your viewpoints, the ability to distill complex information in an understandable manner, utilizing humor to lighten intense situations and being able to give valuable input and solutions - all of this is rolled up under communication skills.
   2. **Minimize your weaknesses.** We all have weaknesses, and you need to find out ways to mitigate them. Some people are predatory and will try to use them against you, or we can just fall short at times. It’s good to admit we have them and try our best to improve.
5. **\[Uncommon\] Try to be nice to everyone, even the @ssholes.**
   1. Don’t burn your bridges, if possible. It’s a small world out there. You will most likely run into people again at some point especially if you work within a certain field. Even if someone did you dirty, keep it professional and move on. I don’t waste my energy trying to get revenge, or telling them off, or whatever… things have a way of evening themselves out.
   2. Sometimes, you have to work with @ssholes. Be nice to them, or at the very least, deliver the message without negative emotions. You never know when the jerk will actually help you.
6. **\[Uncommon\] Opportunities**
   1. **Learn how to identify opportunities, prioritize them and take action on the right ones.** First, it might be easy to identify opportunities if you’ve grown up without many. However, there is an art to knowing which ones to take or leave behind. What I mean is that some opportunities are indirect or too speculative. Some are tempting but are too risky… In the end, it depends on what you want and what you value. For example, it might be tempting to take the higher paying job offer that has little upward mobility because you have an immediate need for money, but in the long run, career development and advancement becomes increasingly important.
   2. **Create opportunities.** You can create opportunities especially nowadays. I created my own jobs by learning some musical instruments and providing lessons that paid me twice the minimum wage at the time (which was still much less expensive than what professional musicians charged), and the occasional gig at $100 an hour. For the record, I disclosed to everyone that I wasn’t a professional musician.
   3. **Opportunity cost.** Evaluate your opportunity costs. Although you might have no choice but to be the fixer of your car / water leak / random plumbing issue / etc., be an assembly person, cook, etc. if you’re able to afford it, it might be worth it to hire a professional to save you the trouble. I calculate how much I make an hour and multiple that to the estimated time it will take me to fix it, and then make my decision. Some opportunity costs aren’t quantifiable by money, but might require sacrifices made on life events. I remember not telling my mom about the parent conferences or mommy and me events at school, because I knew she had to work.
7. **\[Common\] Take advantage of the resources available to you**
   1. There’s no shame in asking for help, but be proactive as much as possible. Take initiative, and take advantage of the resources available to you. It goes both ways. One day, when you’re out of poverty, you’ll remember the help you got and hopefully help others! No one can do it alone.
8. **\[Uncommon\] Your greatest business partner is your significant other.** Think of it this way - Who gets half (theoretically) in the case of a divorce? Cut people out that are toxic and get closer to the ones that make you better.
   1. Haters - There will be haters and naysayers around you. Don’t let the hate get you down.
   2. Try to surround yourself with people that make you better, not worse.
   3. One of the biggest decisions in your life is settling down with “the one.” It has a great impact on your financial life. Sometimes, you can get out of poverty from marrying someone well off; other times, you can get into the trappings of poverty from marrying someone who makes bad financial and personal decisions. All I can say is, do whatever you can to be self-sustainable because the divorce rate is 50%, people’s health fail, shit happens, and in the end, it’s up to you to decide how you want to live your life.
9. **\[Common\] Know your audience and learn how to pitch yourself**
   1. You need to know your audience and adapt to their preferences. This means that you may have to study up on the common trends, specific vernacular and small talk in your desired career field.
   2. Learn how to pitch yourself, not only for interviews but to advance yourself in your career.
10. **\[Common\] Strike a balance**
11. Try to strike a balance in all that you do. For major decisions, sleep on it and get other people’s viewpoints - especially opposing viewpoints. Don’t surround yourself with yes people because this will hurt you in the long run.
12. **\[Common\] Grow your money / earnings potential.**
13. **Education** \- Learn the necessary skills to earn a decent paying job. Whether it be college, trade school, certificates, apprenticeships, etc., gain the knowledge in order to get the experience, which leads to more $$$. There are many threads on this, so I won’t go into further detail. It’s worth noting that I tried to get accreditations and degrees on paper from well-established institutions so it minimizes any credibility issues.
14. **Experience** \- Even if it’s an internship, you need to get your foot in the door by getting real experience. I recall many “entry-level” positions requiring some experience…
15. **Branch out into related fields** \- Jobs are becoming highly specialized. Try not to pigeonhole yourself into one niche and be adaptive to the needs of the job market.
16. **Investing** \- Take advantage of any matching offered by your company, learn how to invest your money even if you don’t have it yet. I believe in value investing and investing in companies that have differentiation, a clear path towards revenue, and actually making revenue. I try to stay away from companies that are losing money even if they are well known (even if it’s in a growth stage) - different thoughts on this though and it’s largely personal preference. Diversify your wealth so that you don’t lose it all at once.
17. **Depends on your area, but try to save up to buy a home** \- Rent money goes out the window vs. you’re able to build equity when purchasing a home plus tax benefits. Lots of advice on this elsewhere.
18. **\[Common\] Learn how to manage your money and track it regularly.** This goes hand in hand with building wealth. What good is it to make a lot of money when you don’t know how to keep it?
19. **\[Uncommon benchmark\]** Differentiate necessities, nice to haves, and wants / splurges. Denote the frequency of use. Analyze how much of your spending habits fall within each bucket. When I was living in poverty, 99%+ of the money spent was on necessities. It was rare that I would get a Christmas present, and I remember thinking as a young child that it meant I was a bad child. I cried myself to sleep and then cheered myself up when I came to the conclusion that Santa couldn’t give me a present because my apartment didn’t have a chimney. (I lived in the suburbs, so we didn’t have toys for tots programs nearby.)
20. **Track your spending habits.** This will make you aware of how much you’re actually spending / wasting / saving. It allows you to make corrections expediently and makes you accountable.
21. **\[Common\]  Save, save, save.**
22. **Saving money** is the first step to getting out of poverty. If you have a 90%+ rate of spending behavior vested in necessities, then it means that you are getting the required discipline to save. Analyze how many unexpected financial events happened in the past year, and then adjust your savings rate % accordingly, or better yet, use a 5 year average.
23. **Biggest savings behaviors** \- Cooking at home, ability to fix things, being good at administrative stuff / filling out paperwork pay off, big time.
24. **Savings from coupons.** Whether it be online, or the ads you get in snail mail, utilize coupons whenever possible!
25. **Frugality**.  Whole subreddit dedicated to this. It’s worth noting that I’m all for saving the environment and saving money and stuff… but I draw the line with reusable toilet paper.

&#x200B;

**Mindset-oriented**

1. **Don’t get trapped in the victim mindset**

I got trapped in the victim mindset in being dealt a bad deck of cards. I didn’t have much handed to me growing up, and I definitely had a lot of resentment and bitterness for suffering for things I didn’t cause myself. This resulted in a depressive “Oh woe is me!” cycle in which I spent a lot of time crying, complaining, being hopeless, etc. Then one day, I realized that I was wasting time because instead of doing something useful, I was spending my time being miserable. Now, don’t get me wrong. Emotions get the best of us and can’t be controlled at times… but deadlines are unforgiving, and I had to make ends meet. So I realized that although I cannot control what happens to me, I can try to control how I react to them… which brings me to the next points.

**2. Turn negatives into positives**

This took a lot of trial and error, but I had to learn how to turn negatives into positives. Stuck with team members that slacked off? I wasn’t happy with them, but I saw it as a leadership opportunity and carried the team. Not enough money to buy breakfast? It’s okay, I don’t have to work out as much. Made fun of for wearing the same clothes? It’s okay, I’m going to channel all the anger I have and study/work more. Success is the best revenge.

3. **It’s okay to fail.** **Just pick yourself back up and try again.** Try as many times as you need to. Try something different. The key is to not be discouraged or paralyzed from the fear of failing. I didn’t have much to lose, so it explains why I kept at it. Have a back up plan, and another backup for the backup.

4. **Get out of your comfort zone and challenge yourself.** You’ll need to get out there and make things happen, because no one is going to do it for you! Get used to doing things you don’t like. I had to leave my ego at the door and have a receptive, learning attitude.

5. **Enjoy the pleasantries but also recognize the faults.** Sometimes, we think in black and white. If you like someone, you can ignore his or her faults, and vice versa. I think it’s important to have a well-rounded, realistic view of everything and everyone, including ourselves.

6. **It’s easy to say you “know” or say you will do something, but hard to actually do it.** There’s a lot of times when I hear people refuse advice because “they already know” or they say they’re going to do it… but very few times when I actually see people applying or practicing the lessons. It’s not just about knowing, it’s about doing.

&#x200B;

**Things I learned while being poor:**

* Jack of all trades - Because you don’t have a lot of resources available, you end up doing a lot of random things.
* I’ve seen people go either way - Either they become GREAT problem-solvers, or really bad at it. You usually have to go through a milieu of different kinds of bullshit, usually simultaneously, so you get good at coming up with solutions on the fly and putting out fires.
* Learned early in life that my best was not enough. It was utterly devastating. I had to learn my shortcomings and limitations, and saw inequities abound.
* I try not to take things for granted. I thank people for helping me and for whatever contribution they bring - big and small.
* I learned not to be as judgmental. Living a tough life, I know I could have messed up and have made mistakes. When someone makes a bad or unhealthy decision, who am I to judge? It could have been me!
* I was ugly, awkward and poor, of which the most painful was being poor. Being poor means that no matter how smart, capable, etc. you are, you still might get passed up because you didn’t have certain connections or opportunities presented to you. It’s a powerless position in which you see the worst in people, and in rare times, the best in people.
* No one wants to hang around someone who is sad / complaining / etc. Although it’s hard at times, I try to be upbeat and positive. I don’t want to worry others or burden them with my problems - each person has enough of his/her own struggles.
* **It’s expensive to be poor.** You get hit with bank monthly minimums, higher interest rates, etc.
* **Social injustices are real and rampant.** This is another thread in itself.
* **Keep your eye on the prize** \- Don’t lose focus. A lot of small steps and small wins are necessary for the big win. It’s okay to have setbacks and make mistakes - just… keep… going.

&#x200B;

**What gave me an edge:**

* **Good reader of people.** This allowed me to avoid toxic people and gauge situations effectively.
* **Anticipate people’s needs.** This gave me an advantage because people really appreciate when you’re able to deliver what they want/need without them having to tell you.
* Struggling AF during junior high and high school competing against kids that had so many resources. I had to put in 2-3 times the effort. I continued this work ethic and this allowed me to get multiple degrees and certifications while working.
* Ability to quickly pick things up, including thinking on the fly. People don’t really hold your hand in the real world. While I had many good teachers, I had to self study a lot of things in the workplace. Most of all, I had to learn how to react and adapt quickly to sensitive and tenuous situations.
* An open mind to learn new things, flexibility and adaptability, being forgiving, giving without expectations or quid pro quo, motivation to do better and be better, and belief in God.

&#x200B;

**Things I learned NOT to do:**

* Try not to get into unhealthy addictive behaviors. It’s difficult to get out of, and it usually perpetuates the cycle of poverty.
* Don’t blame others for everything. Try to be accountable to yourself, and own it. Of course others are to blame sometimes, but playing the blame game doesn’t really solve the problem.
* Try not to become disillusioned, and don’t lose hope. It took me 20+ years to get out of poverty. It might take some others less time, and some others more. However, the key is to keep trying and know that at the end of the day, love heals the pain and covers a multitude of suffering.
* Don’t be cruel to others, even if you think they deserve it. When we get into a cycle of vengeance, you often become destroyed in the process of trying to destroy others.
* Don’t rely on others to break the cycle of poverty for you. If you get a lucky break, then great! However, the reality is that for many people, we have to break the cycle ourselves.
