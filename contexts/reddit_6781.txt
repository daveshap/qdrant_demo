How have many of you gone about getting a recruiter to help you?
I have been job searching for 3 months now, and I have not received a single legitimate interview offer.  In the past week I submitted my resume on a local recruiting agency site, and another more geared toward my background.  There isnâ€™t a phone number listed for candidates to call.  Everyone else I know has had their recruiter find them.
