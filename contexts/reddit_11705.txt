Grandma
She went to the doctor last Friday. They found nodules in her lung and sent her to the hospital. 

She's diagnosed with stage four lung cancer on Saturday. They do a biopsy on her lung and a petscan the next day. The nodules are the size of golf balls and are basically everywhere in her lungs. There was talk about chemo and how they'll do and MRI on Monday to see if it spread to her brain.

She's exhausted and embarrassed because she couldn't breathe well enough in the MRI machine.  They don't mind, you can do it in the morning when you feel better. I tuck her into bed. It'll be okay, Grandma. 

Tuesday, they find two tiny spots in her brain. The doctors don't seem too worried. They decide to only go ahead with chemo instead of both radiation and chemo. We're told she can come home Wednesday.

She calls us from the hospital saying that they haven't told her when she can leave yet. Actually, hang on, the nurse has some news, call you back. We get her oxygen and room set up.  She calls back. She'll tell us what the nurse says when she's home. 

She comes home and our dogs are so happy to see her. She says they're smiling at her. We get her settled She's happy just to be home and to be in her own room. So what was the news, Grandma? 

They did another x-ray, just to compare with the initial one. The tumors are much larger. It's growing rapidly. 

She has weeks instead of months to live. 

She's telling me what clothes and gadgets I can have. 

I tell her I'm moving up my wedding so she can be there. 

She's tells us she's ready to go. 

But I'm not ready to let her go.
