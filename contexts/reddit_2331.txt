the fact that some people even tier out extra curricular activities is sad
so, i was just like reading this college admission blog (pls dont shat on me for doing that)

and basically the person just tiered the whole extra curriculars somewhat like this

tier 4 - nothing special, just a club member

tier 3 - got a leadership position or smtg

tier 2 - won some regional/state level awards

tier 1 - olympic level stufff

and tbh, its just really sad because tbh extra curriculars are supposed to be about showing passion and not how many gold medals a person can win. yeah sure, maybe if you come as a recruited athlete it matters, but like still
