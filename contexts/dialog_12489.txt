SAGE: Trevor your body has been completely healed. All the nerve endings have repaired themselves. If there is any pain in your head it's... in your head.
TREVOR: Jeez it's getting awful crowded in there.
SAGE: My teacher told me once there's a puncture point on your body that can lock your soul within it, even after you're dead. So that when you die you're trapped inside your body, watching it corrode for all eternity.
TREVOR: Look, whatever your Marharagi, told you, forget. You've got to get this fuckin pain to stop.
SAGE: It was an analogy. Your soul is locked up inside you. You need to free it Trevor. You've blocked it from the healing process. That's what we need to do now. Heal your soul. And to do that I you have to give in utterly and without any hesitation or doubt. Do you know what I mean by giving in? It's about trust. Do you trust me implicitly?
TREVOR: I don't even know what's real and what isn't how can I trust anyone?
SAGE: You can trust me. Your wife is dead and you need to move past that. And the only way to move past something completely is to go straight through it, not around it. Surrender yourself to your wife's death. Let it chew you up and spit you back out on the other side. It's the only way you can become whole again.
SAGE: Are you ready?
TREVOR: I surrender...
TREVOR: Wait... what the hell is this...
SAGE: Surrender yourself... surrender yourself...
TREVOR: Kirsty... Kirsty?
KIRSTY: It's okay it was just a nightmare that's all.
TREVOR: You're alive...
KIRSTY: Yes. Now go back to sleep. You're driving the rest of the way to gramma's remember?
KIRSTY: Trevor I've decided we have got to agree on a name before we reach my mother's. This poor kid's going to be starting preschool as student x if we don't make up our minds. So, I've been thinking, what about Daisy?
TREVOR: It's perfect.
