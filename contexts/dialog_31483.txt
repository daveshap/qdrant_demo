WALTER: Why?
ROSEN: To relax.
WALTER: I'm relaxed.
ROSEN: Close your eyes and let your mind be blank.
WALTER: Hey, Rosen, you going to hypnotize me?

ROSEN: Where?
WALTER: In my bed, Rosen. Where do you think?
ROSEN: Where are you?
WALTER: In my bed too.
ROSEN: How old are you and your sister?
WALTER: We're little kids.
ROSEN: But roughly, how old?
WALTER: I'm maybe about six... which would make her four.
ROSEN: And what are you doing?
WALTER: Just lying there. We're taking a nap.
ROSEN: A nap?
WALTER: Yes, a nap. Kids do that. You ever take a nap, Rosen?
