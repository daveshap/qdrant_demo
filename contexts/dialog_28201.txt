JEANNE: That's not what I asked... Why do you want to marry me?
AULON: You listen to your voices, I listen to my heart.
JEANNE: What did the king say?
AULON: He said that... he's making a treaty with the Duke of Burgundy and...
JEANNE: It's a trap! They're buying time till they can bring over more soldiers from England!
AULON: Did your voices tell you that? You told me you hadn't heard them for months...
JEANNE: No, but...
AULON: Or maybe it's Jeanne who's in a trap -- her own trap -- a downward spiral that she can't stop?
JEANNE: Did you come back to marry me or to insult me?
AULON: To marry you.
JEANNE: I will ask my voices... if they come back one day. Meanwhile... I'm going to Compiegne.
AULON: Jeanne... I have been hearing voices -- and believe me, those voices left me in no doubt that you must not go to Compiegne!
AULON: Jeanne... I believe in you -- but can you believe in me for once? Don't go... even if you don't want to marry me.
JEANNE: I would like to marry you. But I have already promised myself... to God.
AULON: But... you've done so much for God as it is... can't you do something for yourself for once -- for Jeanne?
JEANNE: But it is what I want.
AULON: To be killed in battle?
JEANNE: If God wants me to win, he will find a way. And if he wants me to die... if he wants me back... then that's fine too. Then I'll be with him forever.
AULON: Will you at least let me stay with you?
JEANNE: It would not be the same without you.
AULON: We must sound the retreat!
JEANNE: Not yet!
