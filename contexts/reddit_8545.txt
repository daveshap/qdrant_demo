What are the arguments for and against statehood for the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico?
Though both issues have long histories of activism, this topic has been raised recently as [a potential solution to the structural disadvantage faced by Democrats in the Senate](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/10/26/18024542/dc-puerto-rico-statehood-senate-democracy), and in the case of Puerto Rico, as a[ response to the handling of Hurricane Maria.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/puerto-ricos-governor-ramps-up-push-for-statehood-on-anniversary-of-maria/2018/09/20/1d99974c-bcd2-11e8-8792-78719177250f_story.html)

As for the will of the people, a 2016 D.C. statehood referendum had [85% voting for yes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington,_D.C._statehood_referendum,_2016), and a 2017 Puerto Rico referendum had [97% voting for statehood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puerto_Rican_status_referendum,_2017), albeit with a very low turnout. According to a Rasmussen poll from January, [47% of Americans think Puerto Rico should become a state, with only 34% opposed to it. That same poll found 24% said yes to D.C. statehood and 58% said no](http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/general_politics/january_2018/americans_more_receptive_to_puerto_rico_as_a_state_than_d_c).

In 2012, following an earlier vote, [President Obama urged congress to "act" on the issue of Puerto Rico statehood](https://web.archive.org/web/20121207194637/http://caribbeanbusinesspr.com/news/white-house-clarifies-status-stance-79102.html#). In September, President Trump said:

>["With the mayor of San Juan as bad as she is and as incompetent as she is, Puerto Rico shouldn't be talking about statehood until they get some people that really know what they're doing"](https://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-trump-puerto-rico-20180924-story.html)
