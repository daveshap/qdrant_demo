I’m sorry, but I’m going to do it. My cat must know, he is on my lap. At midnight I will do it. Please help me. Any body. I’m honestly done. I don’t care if I’m 13. I just want it to end
I haven’t told anybody how I’m feeling because I don’t want to go to the mental hospital. The mental hospital is hell. If it wasn’t there I would be talking to my parents. I would be getting help. But I can’t, I know the consequences. The hospital punishes me. I would use a hotline but I don’t want police coming to my house. I’m scared. I’m the most scared I’ve been in my life. 





I know nobody will read this, but here I want to tell my story. The truth is, I want to live. I just want the pain to stop. 




I’m a 13 year old girl. I’ve been hospitalized 4 times. I’ve been suffering a lot. I have no self-confidence. I have no love for myself. 
I sew. I sew dolls. I love my dolls. Nobody will understand. 



Here is my first goodbye.  To my dolls: I love you. I know when I leave you will go to. I’m sorry. My heart breaks. I wish I could’ve taken care of you better. You saved my life 2 times. You helped me when I needed it the most. I will say all your names. I love all of you. I’m in tears. I don’t want to leave you. I don’t want to go. Kazumi, Sayaka, Kyoko, Mami, Madoka, Luka, Rin, Homura, Yachiyo, Iroha, Sana, Felicia, Tsuruno, Nikki, Ren, Rena, Mitama, Alina, Kanade, Sakura, Rika, Gumi, Emma, Ruby, Weiss, Blake, Yang, Yowane, Nagisa. I’m so sorry. I love you. All of you




To Miku: I love you. Your not even a doll to me. You are my best friend. My very best friend. You where there when no other human friend loved me. You where there when I cried out for help. You are here now sleeping not knowing anything. I can’t even apologize. It won’t mean anything. I hope in another world we could meet again. I love you.




I draw. Everyday. But nobody likes my drawings.  Here is my second goodbye: to my materials. I wish I could’ve used you more. I wish I could’ve made something worth while out of you. But I couldn’t. Maybe someone else can. I’m sorry.




I used to sing. I lost confidence in doing so. Here is my third goodbye: to my unwritten words. I’m sorry I couldn’t sing you to the world. I’m so sorry.




My fourth: To mommy and daddy and my brother. I love you. I wish I could’ve made you happier. I wish I could’ve made you proud.





And finally Binxy. My cat. You are with me now, in my last hours. I can’t even say anything. You won’t understand. My heart is dust now, because I’m being selfish. You are 14.  I don’t want to make you last years sad. I know you love me. You will miss me. I can’t even say anything. You seem to know. You have your head down. I know I’m being selfish. But please know, I love you. I love you so much Binxy. 




I don’t know what to do. I want help. But I can’t with out going to the hospital. I’m sorry. Please forgive me. Hold my hand. Give me a hug. Anything. With one final cry, please. I don’t want to go. But I can’t stay. I’m sorry. I’m sorry.  I’m sorry.
