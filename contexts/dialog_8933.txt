JACK: I can keep the beat.
SUSIE: Better than that.
SUSIE: What's the matter?
JACK: Nothing.
SUSIE: What'd I say?
JACK: Nothing.
SUSIE: You're upset.
JACK: I'm not upset.
SUSIE: All I said was you were good.
JACK: Look. You don't know good. All right?
SUSIE: What's that supposed to mean?
JACK: It means you wouldn't know good if it came up and fucked you.
SUSIE: You were good.
JACK: Let's make a deal. You shut up.
SUSIE: You were good.
JACK: How do you know?
SUSIE: Because I saw the other people! And they knew you were good! You were good, goddamnit!
