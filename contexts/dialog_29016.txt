SALLY: I could see you were pining away--
BRETT: Oh, that's Mrs. Rosson--remember, you met her yesterday?
SALLY: Yes--I remember--
SALLY: How well do you know her?
BRETT: Just met her on the boat--supposed to play bridge with her yesterday--but she wouldn't--so we played poker instead.
SALLY: Who with?
BRETT: A Mr. Summers and a man called Lother.
SALLY: Oh, you infant! How much did you lose?
BRETT: Lose?--I won a little--
SALLY: That was the come-on--promise me you won't play with them again--
BRETT: What do you know about them?
SALLY: Too much--Remember--I warned you about me-- I used to be Lee Lother's girl--
BRETT: You can live that down, can't you?
SALLY: He's a con man--crooked as a tree--and I was part of the racket--helped him! Now--if you have an appointment elsewhere--I'll excuse you!
BRETT: You can't lose me, Sally--I'm no lily myself!
SALLY: I'm beginning to think you're a pretty swell guy.
BRETT: Come on--let's take a swim.
