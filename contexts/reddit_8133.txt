How does Donald Trump's time spent on vacation and on his own property compare with other presidents in their first couple of hundred days?
Trump has [spent 60 days](http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/how-much-time-trump-spending-trump-properties-n753366) out of his first 200 on his own property and with his [recent vacation](http://www.npr.org/2017/08/04/541581245/trump-heads-to-his-new-jersey-golf-club-for-17-day-working-vacation) I was wondering how this compares to other presidents. Furthermore, what is the significance of him spending time on his own property?
