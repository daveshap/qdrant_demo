Stopping yourself from having thoughts incase someone MAGICALLY reads your mind?
I do this thing where i will be thinking about certain things , or listening to certain songs with headphones, and I instantly have to change my thought pattern , or change the song i'm listening to, incase someone MAGICALLY can read minds, or hear the song I'm listening to ( normally a guilty pleasure song from my emo phase circa 2006 that I know i'd get mercillesly mocked for)  ... I know it's completely irrational  and I feel super weird posting this, but does this happen to anyone else? Ultimately it just ramps up my anxiety  , but I can't help it. It's been happening to me since I was about 10.... I think it's a childhood fear stemming from primary school ... but there is always this fear of someone finding things out about me and teasing me...
