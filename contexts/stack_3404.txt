What does the world of of Ted Chiang's \"Tower of Babylon\" actually look like? Can someone visually explain the world from the 'Tower of Babylon' story? Where does the sun go at night if the world is a cylinder? Is the sun outside/inside of the cylinder or on the same level as the \u201cEarth\u201d?
