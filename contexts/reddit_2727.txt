How to deal with feeling stupid?
So im in the process of training at a new job and in an new field ive never worked in before. Because of the pandemic and some loss of business i havent been able to come in and get consistent hands on trainingm so far fornthe last 3 months ive only had 5 or 6 days where ive come in and done 4 to 5 hours of hands on training for tasks. Then ive been off for two weeks straight because they couldnt schedule me. Anyways, im still making mistakes and the environment isnt a warm place for new people who need to ask a lot of questions. I can tell as soon as i leave the room or clock out forbthe day in being talked about. Its all women so it doesnt really vother me honestly. I expect it. But its frustrating going through this same process while training where by not knowong something you feel stupid. Im pretty sure my boss thinks I'm retarded.

Whats the best move on how to deal with this. Should i be asking my boss how she thinks I'm doing or things she sees in struggling with? Its been communicated that the covid situation has messed up the opportunity to train more hours. But still I feel the pressure to get and remember things right a way and if I dont I'm not competent.

Appreciate any advice and experiences.
