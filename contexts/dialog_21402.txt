VIVIAN: Georgia.
BRIDGET: No wonder. For starts, you should know that hot pants are <u>horrid</u>, even when you do have the legs to carry them off. What are your plans while you're in town?
VIVIAN: Well... I might be going out to dinner.
BRIDGET: You'll want a cocktail dress then. Turn. You have a beautiful figure. A little too out in the open but simply lovely. Size six? Do you need shoes?
VIVIAN: I dunno. Do thigh high, leather boots go with a cocktail dress?
BRIDGET: Philip! We'll need shoes!
BRIDGET: Your uncle will like this.
VIVIAN: He's not really my uncle.
BRIDGET: They never are, dear.
VIVIAN: I got a dress.
MR. THOMAS: I rather hoped you'd be wearing it.
VIVIAN: I didn't want to get it messed. I got shoes too. Wanna see?
MR. THOMAS: That's all right. I'm sure they're quite lovely.
VIVIAN: They were real nice to me there. They treated me, y'know... nice. Thanks, Barney.
