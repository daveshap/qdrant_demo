FEINGOLD: I don't write the questions. I just review them.
NICHOLAS: What's all this for?
FEINGOLD: We want a sense of your overall capabilities, limitations, turn-ons, turn-offs...
NICHOLAS: No, I mean, what is it FOR? What are you selling?
FEINGOLD: Oh... it's a game.
NICHOLAS: A game?
FEINGOLD: Tailored specifically to each participant. Think of it as a great vacation, except you don't go to it, it comes to you.
NICHOLAS: What kind of vacation?
FEINGOLD: It's different every time.
NICHOLAS: Humor me with specifics.
FEINGOLD: We provide whatever's lacking.
NICHOLAS: And if nothing's lacking?
FEINGOLD: May I make two suggestions... ?
NICHOLAS: Do you really expect me to participate without knowing a single thing?
FEINGOLD: First, admit to yourself that it sounds intriguing. Second, you don't have to decide today. Take the silly tests, fill out the forms. One day, the game begins. You either love it or hate it. Decide then. We're like an experimental Book-of-the-Month- Club; drop out at any time with no further obligation. That was my sales pitch.
NICHOLAS: How long will these take?
FEINGOLD: An hour for those... maybe another for the physical.
NICHOLAS: Physical?
FEINGOLD: Cursory examination. Turn-your-head- and-cough sort of thing. You'll be out of here in no time.
