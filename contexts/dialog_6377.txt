JERRY: If my universe had a hub...
LIZA: This would be it?
LIZA: Equitation.
JERRY: I've been reading up on it.
LIZA: Are these yours?
JERRY: Here it is. <u>Conspiracy Theory</u> It just went out Tuesday. Third issue this year. I bet I struck a nerve. Pissed someone off.
LIZA: 'The Space Shuttle's Seismic Secret'. 'The Oliver Stone-George Bush Connection'. Oliver Stone?
JERRY: Stone is their spokesman. You think if someone really had all that information and a national podium to shout it out from that they'd let him do it? Stone's a disinformation flunky. The face that he's alive says it all.
LIZA: Can you prove any of this?
JERRY: Absolutely not. A good conspiracy is an unprovable conspiracy. If you can figure it out, they screwed it up.
LIZA: 'On July 8, 1979, security forces under control of the Trilateral Commission abducted the fathers of all American Nobel Prize winners. The men, many of them octogenarians, were forced at gunpoint to ejaculate into small plastic bottles. The sperm collected is now under study in a laboratory beneath the headquarters of the Rand Corporation in Santa Monica, California.'
JERRY: Pretty scary, huh?
LIZA: Yeah... how many subscribers do you have?
JERRY: Just five. It's the economy... You think maybe one of them is not who they seem?
LIZA: You got a list?
LIZA: You're a Holden Caulfield fan.
JERRY: Who?
LIZA: Holden Caulfield? <u>Catcher in the</u> <u>Rye</u>?
JERRY: Never heard of him.
LIZA: You have ten copies of the book, but you don't know who the main character is?
JERRY: I've never read it. I just -- Every time I see one I buy it. I don't know why exactly... Wanna hear my favorite part?
