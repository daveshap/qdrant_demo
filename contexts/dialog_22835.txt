DANNY: I'm genuinely happy that you found some peace, Nancy. But you can't forgive for Liz. No one can. And you can't forgive for me.
NANCY: Your hatred makes them stronger and you weaker.
DANNY: I don't buy that. There's a place for hatred. Did you know that Liz and I got into an argument the night she was killed? I acted like an ass and I never had a chance to apologize to her. Do you know what that feels like?
NANCY: It's not too late to show her you're sorry.
DANNY: How?
VERNE: By not disgracing her memory!
DANNY: What does that mean?
VERNE: You might as well be spitting on her grave every time you put drugs up your nose. Or did you just conveniently forget that it was drug dealers who killed my daughter?
DANNY: You don't understand.
VERNE: Understand what?
