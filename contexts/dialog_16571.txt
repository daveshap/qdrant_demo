BARNARD: And say, honey, you look a million per cent better. Wholesome, kind of - and clean. You take a tip from me, and don't you ever put that stuff on your face again. Why, it's like hiding behind a mask.
LOVETT: Ha, ha - who are you to be talking about a mask? What do you mean? You've been wearing a mask ever since we met you.
BARNARD: Have I?
LOVETT: It's very strange, you know. You've never told us anything about yourself. Who are you, anyway? Why don't you take your mask off for once!
CONWAY: Yes. Unbosom yourself, Mr. Hyde.[11]
BARNARD: All right, I will! I'll let my hair down! Why not? It can't make any real difference now. Hey Lovey, were you ever chased by the police?
LOVETT: Certainly not.
BARNARD: Believe me, it's no fun. When you fellas picked me up at Baskul, they'd been on my tail for a year.
LOVETT: The police?
BARNARD: Uh-huh. Did you ever hear of Chalmers Bryant?
CONWAY: Chalmers Bryant!
BARNARD: Bryant's Utilities - that's me.
