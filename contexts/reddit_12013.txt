Today's my 21st birthday and I'm totally depressed.
As bad as they were I'm going to miss the development years when things are malleable and you're at your physical peak.

I feel like I don't have an identity beyond being a developing young'un, and it hasn't hit until now that I don't have that option any longer.

I suppose I also feel like it's too soon to be this old. It's going to be just a few years until I'm 25, then just a few years until I'm 30, etc. Yes, I don't feel young at all.
