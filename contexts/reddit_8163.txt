Was Fidel Castro a "benevolent dictator?" How was life in Cuba under his power?
Fidel Castro [just died](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/26/world/americas/fidel-castro-dies.html) and I realized I have little to no knowledge of the reality of his regime. Cuban-Americans have been celebrating his death, and their stories depict a [life under political oppression and tyranny](http://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/world/americas/fidel-castro-en/article117221468.html). That said, I have some very left-leaning friends on Facebook who are mourning his death, saying that his image has been distorted by "American imperialism." To what extent was Fidel Castro a so-called "benevolent dictator?" What was it like to be Cuban under his power?
