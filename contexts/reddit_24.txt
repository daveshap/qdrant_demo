I am a 15 year old girl and haven't been feeling great since October (details below)
 Hi. as stated, I an fifteen and in my tenth year of school.

In October my family put our old dog down

In late November my Opa died, last week my family's other old dog was put down.

I used to feel so confident in my relationship with my friends and my academic achievement. Now I feel that my friends no longer need me and that I am not as smart as I used to be.

My Oma died along time ago and with my Opa dying and my old dog dying (gift from my Oma) I feel like I've lost all connection to my extended family, not that there was much to begin with. I am beginning to fake smiles a lot more at school and feel that I have to put on an act for my friends.

to add to this I have been seeing my abusive father around town (he still lives close to my family) and feel that there are certain places I used to love that I can't visit anymore due to fear that he would try to talk to me.

Due to all these things and my own depleting self-esteem I have begun to force myself to throw up. I don't to it to much to be worrying but when someone makes a offhand comment about what I eat (it's not their fault. I'm overreacting) I run to the bathroom and try to make myself throw-up. It doesn't always work and that makes me feel worse.

can someone please tell me how to feel better
