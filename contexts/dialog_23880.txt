GRAHAM: Oh.
MORGAN: They tell you everything in this book.
MORGAN: It says they're probably very small -- like my height -- because, as their brains developed, there was no use for physical development. It says they're probably vegetarians, because they would have realized the benefits of such a diet.
GRAHAM: Who wrote this book?
MORGAN: Scientists who have been persecuted for their beliefs.
GRAHAM: That means they're unemployed.
