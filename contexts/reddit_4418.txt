I'm not going to actively try to kill myself, but I wouldn't mind dying.
If it comes along, I know reflexes and all that will kick in but right now I wouldnt mind it. Everyone would be so much better off especially financially. I would be better off. My brother would get to be the focus of the family, the first one in University. He would be happier. I know at the beginning they would be sad and distraught but they would have to move on and carry on. They may not realise it but they would be better of. Dying terrifies me, just the thought of nothingness, or maybe theres an afterlife of some sorts, i'll take anything as long as I'm happy and everyone else is. I just want what I'm going through to end but it won't because it's more than just depression. There so many factors that go into me wanting to not be around its crazy. I am in pain 24/7, and am so anxious all the time. My father hates who I need to be. I was dealt such bad cards and I don't want to play anymore.
