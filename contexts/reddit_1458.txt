A poem my sister wrote about her anxiety. She asked me to share in the hope someone resonates with it
How is it to be in so many places at once

To be yesterday, to be tomorrow and to be now 

To be so connected

Yet so distant

Always entering a new thought

But still can't find a way out

Locked in a prison

Yet still homeless

To hear laughs behind

That make me cry ahead

For wanting her to leave

But not wanting to be alone

Even though I want her to go

I need her to stay

She's all I've ever known

I must learn to love her

She's trying to protect me

We come as a two now and I'm starting to think that might be okay
