GALVIN: Dr. Towler; page 406, 'Contraindications to general anesthetic. Ideally a patient should refrain from taking nourishment up to nine hours prior to induction of general anesthetic.' Does that sound familiar?
DR. TOWLER: Yes. I wrote it.
GALVIN: 'Practice and Methodology in Anaesthesia.' General textbook on the subject. Is that correct?
DR. TOWLER: I. Yes. It is.
GALVIN: And you wrote that...
DR. TOWLER: Yes.
GALVIN: ...Page 414, 'If a patient has taken nourishment within one hour prior to inducement, general anesthetic should be avoided at all costs because of the grave risk the patient will aspirate food particles into his mask.' Is that what happened to Deborah Ann Kaye? She aspirated into her mask?
DR. TOWLER: She threw up in her mask, yes. But she hadn't eaten one hour prior to admission.
GALVIN: If she had eaten, say one hour prior to admission, the inducement of a general anesthetic... the type you gave her... would have been negligent...?
DR. TOWLER: Negligent. Yes... it would have been criminal. But that was not the case.
GALVIN: Thank you.
JUDGE: Mr. Concannon...?
CONCANNON: Nothing further, your Honor.
JUDGE: Mr. Galvin, rebuttal?
