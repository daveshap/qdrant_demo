should i wait for my company to call me back???
so i work at call center company, at april the HR make me take unpaid leave and promising after the wuhan virus problem conclude they will take me back, it been a month i still keep communicate with them but they haven't give an ok, honestly i love this job they pay like twice from my previous job and it less stressful. ( i was ready to wait it out but bad thing happens and if i didn't start working next month i might need to move back to my parent house) sorry for bad english
