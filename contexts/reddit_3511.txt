Beware Of Love Bombing
I have been reading about ladies using the level of texting to tell whether a guy is into them or not but sometimes this isn't always true. Some guys in the very beginning will text you from morning to evening, say all the right words, compliment you day and night, send you all the beautiful songs etc and then when you are in so deep they will either ghost you or withdrawal which inturn will drive your crazy wondering what you did wrong, you will start apologising for things you didn't do and guess what, you will blame yourself for being too clingy and for messing up something so perfect! 

But you weren't in the wrong at all, some people use it as technique to get what they want by being the perfect prince charming, they will even plan the future with you and make you feel like they are the one! When it takes even longer or seems like they won't get it, they will ghost or withdrawal completely. It is never about you, its about them winning the game. 

So as you get so excited about him texting you every minute and thinking he can't get enough of you, ask yourself important questions? Listen to your intuition, if something is too good to be true, it often isn't true. 

Someone can text you all day because they are bored not because they can't get enough! Someone will text you twice a week because they are generally busy but they do really like you and want to know you! Also a word of advice stalking someone to see if they are online is unhealthy and will lead you to madness. Learn to know the person you are dealing with and don't let texting be the measure of how much that person loves you! There are so many ways to know someone loves you besides texting and the ultimate is being straight up and asking them.

This applies to both ladies and gentlemen. I hope it speaks to someone out there.
