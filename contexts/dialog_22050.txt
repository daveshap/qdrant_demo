RUDY: They changed the layout -- whadda they call you? Mr. Monster? They remodeled the place. When I worked there -- listen to me -- guy that managed the joint, guy who ran it--
ASHLEY: Jack. Jack Bangs.
RUDY: Right, Jack Bangs. Uh... guy was always talking bout fixing the place up. Maybe get a better crowd. Musta gone and done it while I was in the Mountain. I don't know this map, man. How the hell am I supposed to tell you what door goes where?
GABRIEL: They wouldn't have changed the security setup.
RUDY: When I worked there, this was Bangs, office. Back here. He kept a little safe in the... uh, the wall, money held take for himself, skim from the Indians. Called it the... uh... ...the Powwow Safe.
JUMPY: The Powwow Safe?
RUDY: His personal safe, he gave it a name. Now you're telling me they've taken his office, put the buffet there? Then who knows what else they changed.
GABRIEL: So what the hell good are you...
RUDY: You'd have to get me inside. Get inside, watch where the money's moving, see where the guards are going. Then I could work with your map.
GABRIEL: Wrong, convict. You walk in there, they recognize you.
