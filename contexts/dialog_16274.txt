NICK: Yeah?
DEAN: That's no way to answer the phone.
NICK: Is that you, Dean?
DEAN: Sure is.
NICK: What can I do for you?
DEAN: You know those shotguns I sold ya, well I need 'em back.
NICK: Not likely I am afraid; I don't think I'll be seeing them again.
DEAN: I got the money to pay for 'em.
NICK: I am sure you do, but I don't think you understand; I am not going to see them or the guns again.
