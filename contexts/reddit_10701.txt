Fuck relationships, whats the point anymore?
Have you ever been hooked on someone knowing that you can never have them? Well in my case my ex is my problem. Ik people tell me to get over her and tell me that itll be alright BUT IT FUCKING ISNT i try my hardest to get my mind off of her, i try my hardest to move on but i cant stand being away from her. Shes giving me the hardest time cause she says shes there for me 1 moment then the next shes telling me she doesnt care. FUCK SAKE  if she keeps fucking with my feelings like this ill probably end it all and just be better cause Right Now im feeling that killing myself is the only way out of this pain ðŸ˜­ðŸ”«ðŸ”ª
Please someone help me with some advice, i legit dont know how to cope :(
