FENSTER: Everybody I ever worked with, did time with.
HOCKNEY: They fucking know everything.
KEATON: This is not right.
FENSTER: I don't know. Who was that guy that used to talk about Soze in New York?
FENSTER: Yeah. He said he did jobs for him. Indirect stuff. Always five times more money than the job was worth.
KEATON: Come on. The guy is a pipe dream. This Kobayashi is using him for window dressing .
FENSTER: I don't know. This is bad.
HOCKNEY: It's bullshit. This guy could be L.A.P.D. I think it's a setup.
FENSTER: The way I hear it, Soze is some kind of butcher. No pity.
