JENNY: You sure this is your car?
TEENAGER: My grandmother's rich.
JENNY: Slow down, slow down.
TEENAGER: Geez, Mrs. Haydn, we just got going.
JENNY: I told you I'm looking for someone.
TEENAGER: In the cars, too?!
JENNY: I don't know where he is.
TEENAGER: This is going to be a real drag. I thought you wanted to go fast.
TEENAGER: They after you?
JENNY: What? No, of course not.
TEENAGER: Would be kinda neat if they were. I think I could outrun them. Maybe get my picture in the papers.
COOK: Well, here we are... You go down that ramp there, you're sure to get a ride.
STAR MAN: Thank you.
COOK: And don't be shy about your English. You speak better than a lot of people I know. Take care of yourself.
