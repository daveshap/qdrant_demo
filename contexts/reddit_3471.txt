Pro tip: If you're horny and want to text your ex, masturbate first, and then reassess how you feel!
I just broke up with someone I was seeing for a whirlwind 2.5 weeks. She messaged me that she misses me, and I really wanted to tell her to come over. Instead, I masturbated and then thought long and hard about what I wanted. And I don't want her.

I mean, she's great, but not right for me, and if I had told her to come over I know I would have gotten sucked by into being with her. (This was a difficult decision, because I really liked her despite the multiple things that lead me to realize we aren't compatible long term, and I chose to end it before it ended due to the incompatibilities.)
