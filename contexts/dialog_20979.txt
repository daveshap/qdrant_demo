SUSAN: Do you remember about five years ago, that uh... incident at Purnell Labs?
NEBBLEMAN: Oh yeah. They were working on molecular assemblers, too, weren't they?
SUSAN: They also tried using viral R.N.A. as the bonding element.
NEBBLEMAN: That's right. C.D.C. found out and closed them down...
NEBBLEMAN: Yeah, somebody broke in and stole the samples, one of those animal rights groups, right? I remember now, they freed all the monkeys which caused that huge pileup on the Massachusetts Turnpike, right?
SUSAN: Yeah. But it wasn't a group. It was one man.
NEBBLEMAN: That's the guy?
