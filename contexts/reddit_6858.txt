Scored a full-time position with a mortgage company, but I'm worried about job security.
Hi all!,

So I just graduated graduate school but my major (film production) is getting hit hard by COVID-19 so I  applied for a lot of other jobs, and got a full-time remote job with a big name mortgage company. I took it because of the lack of options and to avoid unemployment but looking at Glassdoor etc., a lot of people mention lay offs after the house buying season ends towards the end of summer. I was wondering if there is anyone here who was in a similar position at a mortgage company and if you got laid off ever or if you were able to stay on throughout the year (for reference my position is entry-level disclosure analyst). All help and replies are appreciated. Stay safe y'all!
