CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN: You are a Hungarian; you served in the army, and left on account of weakness in the loins. He gambles a great deal, and wins. Do you know the cards well?
RODERICK: Only a very little, as soldiers do.
CAPTAIN GALGENSTEIN: I had thought you more expert. You must find out if the Chevalier cheats. He sees the English and Austrian envoys continually, and the young men of either ministry sup repeatedly at his house. Find out what they talk of, for how much each plays, especially if any of them play on parole. If you are able to, read his private letters, though about those which go to the post, you need not trouble yourself -- we look at them there. But never see him write a note without finding out to whom it goes, and by what channel or messenger. He sleeps with the keys of his dispatch-box with a string around his neck -- twenty frederics, if you get an impression of the keys.
MINISTER GALGENSTEIN: Does this assignment interest you?
RODERICK: Yes, Minister, I am interested in any work in which I can be of service to Captain Galgenstein.
CHEVALIER: You are the young man who M. de Seebach recommended?
RODERICK: Yes, sir. Here is my letter.
CHEVALIER: Your name is Lazlo Zilagyi?
RODERICK: Yes, sir.
CHEVALIER: You come highly recommended by Herr Seebach.
RODERICK: Herr Seebach was a very kind employer.
CHEVALIER: For whom else have you worked?
RODERICK: No one, sir. Before that I served in the army but had to leave due to weakness of the loins.
CHEVALIER: Who else can give me information about you?
RODERICK: Only the agency of servants.
