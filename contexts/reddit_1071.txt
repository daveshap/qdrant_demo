UPDATE: OH MY GOD YOU GUYS I GOT MY FIRST JOB!!
I was already proud enough of [getting through just the interview ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/bkn5eo/update_im_at_my_job_interview/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app)

but oh my god, I didn’t think I’d actually get the job!! I know I’m super late to this getting-your-first-job thing but hey, better late than never, right!? 

I’m just going to be bagging groceries but I’ll be making $3 an hour more than I ever thought I’d make and oh my god.. I HAVE A JOB HOLY SHIT 

I have a week to mentally prepare myself for training. Everyone so far has been so extremely kind, so I feel a lot better about the whole thing though I’m still shaking with nerves right now. The manager is extremely kind, the woman I just talked to on the phone was amazing, I met some of the people I’ll be working with and they were all so very nice. 

Is it stupid I actually want to cry??? I’m so happy??
