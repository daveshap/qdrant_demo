TITO: Jon, this is goddam insane. You can't go through with it. What about Eve?
ARCHER: She doesn't know -- and she never will.
TITO: You haven't got a chance in hell of fooling Pollux. Castor drinks, smokes and walks around with a 24-hour hard-on. He's nothing like you.
ARCHER: Don't worry. I've done my homework. I'll get Pollux to talk.
TITO: Either way, come Saturday morning -- I'm pulling you the hell out of there.
