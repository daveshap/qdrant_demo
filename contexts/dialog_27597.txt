STANTON: Said as much myself, Doc. Can't place him, though. To look at him, you'd think the cheese slid off his cracker. Well, morning's half-over. I'm off.
PETE: Thank you, Mr. Lawson.
STANTON: Don't mention it. Whoever-you-are.
LARDNER: Any idea how you got here, son?
PETE: No, sir.
LARDNER: Been drinkin' a bit, have we?
PETE: I don't remember. I guess so. Smells like it. Tastes like it.
LARDNER: Well, you've been wet to the skin. You must've fallen in.
PETE: I guess I did.
LARDNER: Lucky you got out, that water's got quite a pull, and it empties straight into the ocean.
LARDNER: Here, one of mine.
PETE: Thanks.
LARDNER: Do you remember if you were driving a car? Maybe you went over the bridge. No guard rail there, it's easy to do. It's happened before.
PETE: It's possible. I just don't remember.
LARDNER: And you don't know your name or who you are, that right?
PETE: I... no, I... I just can't...
LARDNER: It's okay, son. We just need to call you something. That's all.
LARDNER: What is it?
PETE: Call me... Ishmael?
LARDNER: Well, at least you remember Moby Dick.""
