EPPS: Get off him.
WES: He snuck in here thinking we were asleep, only I wasn't sleeping. Would have slit our throats if I hadn't stopped him.
EPPS: Get off him!
EPPS: What happened?
WES: I told you. He tried to steal our gold. He tried to kill us.
JAEGER: With what? He doesn't have a weapon.
WES: He's a soldier. He doesn't need a weapon. He's got rocks. He's got bare hands.
