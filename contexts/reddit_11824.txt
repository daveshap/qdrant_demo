I don't want to go to the GP because I'm afraid of their response
I get sudden periods of depression lasting 3-7 hours, feelings of being alone when surrounded by people, the feeling of bringing shame to family because of not being 'good enough' or under achieving expectations. Nearly everyday I get a sudden loss of energy and motivation so obvious that my family and a few friends are questioning me about it. Then to top it off I get feelings of sudden aggression and feelings of wanting to self harm. 
I also drink a lot more than I should, just because when I'm drunk the voices in my head stop and I can sleep.

I have told one of my friends how I have been feeling and she told me to go seek help and I want to, but I'm afraid of what they will tell me. I also feel like my family will be ashamed of me for not just asking them for help before seeing a doctor about it.
