Boss demanding more work with no pay increase/overtime
 

In an email sent this morning, my direct supervisor said, "Absolutely no overtime, any hours over 40, will be approved for the foreseeable future. You guys are doing a great job with xxx during the COVID-19 crisis. However, we need to keep this within the allotted, budgeted hours... At times you might exceed that time limit, but please note going over 40 will not be approved. Please keep up with your hours as you go during the week to ensure you do not go over 40. We also can't afford to have folks coming up at the end of the week with only a handful of hours left for Friday. "

This supervisor also takes time of every other week.

I am an hourly employee at a community newspaper in the United States. I had triple the work put on my shoulders in the last month after layoffs, but I still get paid the same $12 as when I started when I started three years ago (I have a four-year degree and experience, but had to move back in with parents due to mental health issues).

Someone please give me some guidance during this trying time. Do I just say no and that I can't do the extra work?
