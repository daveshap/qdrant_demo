BIG NURSE: Am I to take it that there isn't a man among you who has an opinion concerning this matter? Mister Harding, you've stated on more than one occasion that you suspected your wife of seeing other men.
HARDING: Yes, Miss Ratched, this is correct.
BIG NURSE: But you have no proof.
HARDING: No, Miss Ratched...
BIG NURSE: And yet you suspect her.
HARDING: Yes, that is correct.
BIG NURSE: Why?
HARDING: I can only speculate as to the reasons why.
BIG NURSE: Have you ever speculated, Mister Harding, that you are impatient with your wife because she does not meet your mental requirements?
HARDING: Miss Ratched. Given all the conditions of that sublime relationship, coupled with the subsequent annihilation of all that I held to be sacred, mentally, physically and emotionally, the only thing that I can speculate on, at this late date, is how I will justify the very existence of my life, with or without my dear wife.
SEFELT: What's he talkin' about?
