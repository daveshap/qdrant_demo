GABRIEL: He shouldn't make light. That Redcoat should not have been killed.
BILLINGS: He's not making light.
BILLINGS: You don't know him very well, do you?
GABRIEL: He's my father.
GABRIEL: I know him well enough?
BILLINGS: Don't fault him for having grown up on the frontier. It was a harder time and a harder place than you know.
BILLINGS: Well?
MARION: I've just been inside the mind of a genius. Lord Cornwallis knows more about war than I could in a dozen lifetimes.
BILLINGS: Cheerful news to greet the morn.
MARION: His victories at Charleston and Camden were perfect, strategically, tactically, logistically. But he has a weakness.
MARION: Lord Cornwallis is brilliant. His weakness is that he knows it.
GABRIEL: Father?
MARION: Pride is his weakness.
BILLINGS: Personally, I'd prefer stupidity.
MARION: Pride will do.
