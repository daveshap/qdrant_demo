How do you say “No” to a guy in a nice way.
I drive Uber/Lyft part time. Picked up a two male paxs that proceeded to ask me to usually questions., age, native to the area etc. Ten mins before the ride ends one asks me if I’m single then asks if he could give me his number. I try to keep it professional when I’m driving and I generally just wasn’t interested so I said something along the lines of “I’m not really trying to date right now and I don’t want to take your number and not call so I’m going to keep it professional and decline.”  Then we rode in awkward silence the rest of the trip. I saw them looking at my face trying to gauge a reaction. The whole thing felt weird. I felt like I was nice but maybe it could have been ..idk “cleaner.” He wasn’t unattractive just too young for me and we weren’t really flirting so it came kinda left field. Plus I could tell he was shy because his friend said first “My friend has a question for you” which is a typical shy guy move. 

Reading these subs help me understand how hard it is for guys to talk to girls and I felt a little bad for how I said it. Guys, What’s a preferred way to get a rejection?
