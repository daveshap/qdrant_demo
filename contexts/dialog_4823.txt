MARCUS: No, you didn't, Frank, thank you. But there's still a couple hours left on the shift.
FRANK: I need a drink, that's all.
DISPATCHER LOVE: Twelve Young, answer the radio. I have a call for you.
MARCUS: She said to me, I love the way you talk on the radio.
DISPATCHER LOVE: I can't wait all night, Young. I'm holding a priority and if you don't answer I'm going to knock you out of service.
MARCUS: Don't worry, hon. Young is here and he's gonna help out--just remember, you owe me.
DISPATCHER LOVE: You're going to three-four Avenue C, 17 year-old female cardiac arrest, no further information.
MARCUS: Ten-four, hon.
MARCUS: Look at that. A fat junkie. That's a first.
FRANK: What's wrong.
CARLOS: No English. She has terrible pain in her belly.
FRANK: Pregnant.
CARLOS: No, no, that's impossible.
FRANK: Are you pregnant? Estas embarazada?
FRANK: Can you walk? Puedes caminar?
CARLOS: She say she in great pain.
FRANK: Thanks for the translation. What's your name? Nombre?
