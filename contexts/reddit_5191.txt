Failed my first job interview ever—advice?
Hello reddit. I’m a 17 year old who just had a very bad interview experience. This was my first interview ever and I blew it! I went in for an interview to become a lifeguard and I messed up on one component during the practical skills portion of the interview.

I feel terrible. I keep replaying the interview in my head and regret the small (yet crucial) actions that I made that led me to failure. I haven’t slept at all this past week because I’ve been too nervous for the interview, however I guess I won’t be sleeping well now either.

The upside is that they’re offering me a second chance (yay!) next week. I know I can pull it off, and hopefully the employers saw that today. Even thought I have this second opportunity, I can’t stop feeling like a failure for what happened today. 

I know I will encounter more interview fails in my future, but it doesn’t lessen the blow from this one. What do you guys do when you’ve failed an interview?
