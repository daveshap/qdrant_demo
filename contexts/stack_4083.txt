When traveling by train in Finland what can I expect from these options? I am in the process of booking some train tickets for my trip in Finland.Apart from technical problems in selecting the specific seat, I have a few questions about the available options, since I am not familiar with Finnish trains.I suffer from a mild form of dust allergy / hay-fever. Would it be appropriate for me to select an \"allergy seat\" or is it reserved for more severe allergies?a seat upstairs from the restaurant is available, is that car the only one with two floors, or all cars have an upper seating floor? (I hope to be able to enjoy the scenery a bit, and I guess the upper floor would be more suited for that)edit to answer this comment:<blockquote>  could you tell what route/service you're planning to take, since train configurations can differ significantly.</blockquote>I am mostly looking at the leg between Rovaniemi and Tampere, some of the options have a change in Oulu where the above options are available. I also plan other legs, but they will be significantly shorter (Turku, and then Helsinki) so it will be less of a problem if I cannot see much outside.
