database design for accounting systems How the records are updated in an accounting system i.e., what is the standard practice?do you keep all the records and do the calculations on the fly or you add and subtract in each time from a final amount say \"$current_balance\". The first approach of doing the calculations on the fly i.e, summing up all the deposits and subtracting all the expenses is a sure way to get the result but I can see a definite scalability problem as the number of rows grow.On the other hand accumulating in a variable say \"$current_balance\" and just updating it has its shortcomings as well. So what is the recommended  practice to approach this problem?
