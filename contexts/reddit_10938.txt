I will forever resent everyone who told me it gets better.
I will forever resent those who told me to wait because I was young. Because "it gets so much better once you're done with school!"

I will forever have deep hatred for those who told me to just go to therapy, get on meds, get professional help. Idk how the fuck it could ever help anyone but sure as the blood on the crucible it never helped me.

I fucking hate empty platitudes.

I fucking hate false promises.

It doesn't get better. And I'm far too weak, tired and lonely to keep pretending that it will.

Fuck you.
