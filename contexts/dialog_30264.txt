JUDGE: Now, have you boys tried to resolve your little difficulty because that certainly would save the Commonwealth a lot of time and bother.
GALVIN: This is a complicated case, your Honor...
JUDGE: I'm sure it is, Frank: and let me tell you something. If we find it so complex, how in the hell you think you're going to make a jury understand it? See my point? Let's talk a minute. Frank: what will you and your client take right now this very minute to walk out of here and let this damn thing drop?
GALVIN: My client can't walk, your Honor.
JUDGE: I know full well she can't, Frank. You see the Padre on your way out and he'll punch your ticket. You follow me? I'm trying to help you.
CONCANNON: Your Honor, Bishop Brophy and the Archdiocese have offered plaintiff two hundred and ten thousand dollars.
JUDGE: Huh!
CONCANNON: My doctors didn't want a settlement at any price. They wanted this cleared up in court. They want their vindication. I agree with them. But for today the offer stands. Before we begin the publicity of a trial. For today only. When I walk out that door the offer is withdrawn. As long as you understand that. It's got to be that way.
