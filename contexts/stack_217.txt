How to handle stuck updates? I've got a (current other than this latest update - edit macOS High Sierra 10.13.6 Update) OS X which has stopped updating.  It lists the update, goes through the install, says to reboot.  However, after rebooting the same update is in the list.  Looking at the history it has \"installed\" probably a dozen times now...  Obviously it's not working, but whatever is failing is happening silently.  No error messages.  Looking for debugging suggestions if not outright solutions such as \"yeah that latest update is just bad\".  :-)
