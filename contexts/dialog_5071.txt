NUKE: How come you don't like me?
CRASH: 'Cause you don't respect yourself, which is your problem, but you don't respect the game--and that's my problem. You got a gift.
NUKE: What do I got?
CRASH: A gift. When you were a baby the gods reached down and turned your left arm into a thunderbolt.
CRASH: You got a Hall of Fame arm but you're pissing it away.
NUKE: I ain't pissing nothing away--I got a Porsche already. A 944 with A.C. and a quadraphonic Blaupunkt.
CRASH: You don't need a quadraphonic Blaupunkt--you need a curve ball. In the Show, everybody can hit the fastball.
NUKE: You been in the Majors?
CRASH: Yep.
