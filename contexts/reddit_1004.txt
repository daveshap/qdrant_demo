Anxiety is trying to stop me from going to a car wash so I’m going to the car wash in an act of sheer disrespect towards anxiety
As the title says, I’ve got “a case of the spooks” where I feel woozy and dizzy and icky about just going to a car wash. As a kid I used to love going,  but now I find the chemically smell kind of difficult to manage. But the car is dirty and I want to do this. 

So now that anxiety has gotten involved, I want to be rude to it. So I’m gonna go get this car clean!

Edit: we got there and there was a line up of 5 cars ahead of us, so I had to double down on anticipatory anxiety too, but I WON. And the car is very pretty now!
