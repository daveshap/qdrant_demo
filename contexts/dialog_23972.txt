ELAINE: I'm not taking away your daughter, just your deal. You and I both know, after the divorce I kept you on for old time's sake, so you could still hold your head up in front of Lainey. I called what's his name at Warner's. He said he'd take a meeting -- in July. I've fought for you Viktor... You want to talk severance?
VIKTOR: You can have everything -- office, car, assistants -- all I want is the picture.
ELAINE: The picture's dead.
VIKTOR: So there's no problem -- I can have the rights, the negative too?
ELAINE: They're yours. But how are you going to finish it? Without a star there's no movie.
VIKTOR: I don't need a star. All I need is an actor -- I'll reshoot the part, cut out Nicola and replace her with a real actor. A real leading lady.
ELAINE: Even if you find her, you know the problem with unknowns, Viktor. If they're good, they get known. And then you're back to sorting their candy... and worse. I'm sorry, Viktor.
LAINEY: Hi, Dad.
VIKTOR: Hello, sweetheart.
LAINEY: I'm sorry Mom canned you.
VIKTOR: It's really... not anything, Lainey. It's just --
LAINEY: Don't feel too bad. Mom runs the place and they still walk all over her. You're better off out of it.
VIKTOR: You look very grown up. What are you doing? You meeting your mom for dinner?
