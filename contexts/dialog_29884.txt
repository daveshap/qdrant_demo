LAURA: You're not Bob are you, Harold? If you are, you can kill me right now. Kill me right now, if you are.
HAROLD: Laura, no, I'm not. I'm not Bob. Poor Laura. I wish I could help you.
LAURA: I hate him, I hate it. Sometimes I love it. But now I'm afraid. I am so afraid.
HAROLD: But you're strong Laura... so much stronger than I... How can I help you? I can't. I can't even go outside.
HAROLD: What about James? Can't James help you? You two are so in love.
LAURA: He's in love with a girl who's dead. It is dangerous for you to have it. I'm sorry.
HAROLD: I'm so sorry, Laura.
