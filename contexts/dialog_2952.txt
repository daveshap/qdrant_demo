BASQUIAT: You wanna buy some ignorant art? Ten bucks.
ANDY WARHOL: Ignorant art?
BASQUIAT: Yeah... Like â€“ stupid, ridiculous, crummy art.
ANDY WARHOL: Ohhh. That's new. That sounds good.
BASQUIAT: Ten bucks apiece.
ANDY WARHOL: I can give you five. You didn't do very much to these.
BASQUIAT: You don't even work on your stuff!
BRUNO: It doesn't matter how much you worked on them. It matters how much you can get for them.
BASQUIAT: I can get ten.
