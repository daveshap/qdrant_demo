MEMPHIS: You think it can be done?
OTTO: Are you considering a comeback tour?
MEMPHIS: Tell me...
OTTO: It can be done. Take two days to shop; one to prep. I'll offer up my bible for a small fee. You also have to hope Kip's jerk-circus didn't undo Castlebeck's linkage so much so that he's setting up surveillance teams on every city block. And then get yourself a crew...
MEMPHIS: The hard part ...
OTTO: A people is a detour of nature to get 6 or 7 great men - Yes
MEMPHIS: Is he still working here ?
OTTO: The old crew. Go find them. I can't help you with that. Since I've cleaned up the act a bit, they no longer come around... A pity how legitimacy makes you unpopular -
MEMPHIS: I Just don't know how happy they'll be to see me
OTTO: I remember I had a 1964 Buick Opal. worst car ever built. Value job. Everything broke and I-fixed it. A coma car - built to German specs. Plastic gas line. 3 speedometer head. On a quiet night, you could hear it rusting in the garage. But when that car was gone, I missed it. If it came driving back in here right now, there'd be tears and laughter ...
MEMPHIS: And the moral of that story is -- ?
OTTO: Go to them. They'll be happy to see you ... Ahhh...
