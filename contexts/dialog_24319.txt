PAUL: Jesus, do you make a lot of noise. Can't you see I'm trying to work?
RASHID: I'm sorry. They just... they just slipped out of my hands.
PAUL: A little less clumsiness around here would be nice, don't you think?
RASHID: I'm a teenager. All teenagers are clumsy. It's because we're still growing. We don't know where our bodies end and the world begins.
PAUL: The world is going to end pretty soon if you don't learn fast. Look, why not make yourself useful? I'm just about out of smokes. Go around the corner to the Brooklyn Cigar Company and buy me two tins of Schimmelpenninck Medias.
RASHID: Twenty dollars is a lot of money. Are you sure you can trust me with it? I mean, aren't you afraid I might steal it?
PAUL: If you want to steal it, that's your business. At least I won't have you around here making noise. It might be worth it.
