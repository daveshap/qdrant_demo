I think it's incredibly insulting to say, "I'm not ready for a relationship" if we met on a dating app.
EDIT: Probably important to preface this post: the primary app I use is Hinge. It's supposed to be a relationship-oriented app. It's not like I'm on Tinder and getting mad that nobody there wants a relationship.
   
Ghosting is barely half the issue. I'm just burned out from talking to someone, even going on a date or two only for them to say, "I'm not ready for a relationship." I think, above all else, that's the most insulting thing I hear. Because it means, "I'm actually not ready for a relationship but I also want to be on dating apps and get attention from people" OR "I don't like you but I don't want to tell you that I don't like you". Hell, one time I was having a really good conversation with someone, only for them to ask me for a picture of myself (I mean, we met on a dating app, so she knew what I looked like already?) They immediately followed that with, "oh, i'm not ready for a relationship right now."  
   
Maybe you all have different opinions. I'd just like to hear some logic either way. Maybe it's a hot take, but I'd simply rather get ghosted. I'm not tone deaf, I'll take the hint. 
   
Seriously, how do I meet someone without going through this BS? 
   
EDIT: After some thought and reading the comments, I think my frustration is this: many people who use dating apps simply don't know what they want and I do. Maybe I need to be more up front and simply ask what they're looking for before committing to dates. Anyway, I appreciate the feedback.
