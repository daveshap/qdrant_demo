Is that supposed to deter me?

Why would I want to take the hard way? I'm TIRED of taking the hard way, that's literally why I'm suicidal in the first place.

Trying to make us feel bad for wanting to die really isn't helpful. 

It just makes me feel like a terrible person for being weak which makes me want to die even more.

I really don't get some of these arguments...



Edit: I don't mean to say that the actual act of dying/taking your life is easy, but that suicide is giving up, and giving up is easier than continuing to live. I hope that makes sense.

It's like the actual suicide will be intense and scary, but afterwards I'll never have to experience anything ever again and I won't ever have to be conscious again.
