Should I work with Aerotek?
Hey everyone I just had a few things on my mind and wanted to get advice. The main question is, should I continue to work with Aerotek as a staffing agency? I have read reviews talking about how terrible of a company they are and I was trying to come to a determination of if I should. I have already worked with them and within a few days of that, they set me up in with an interview and I actually got the job that I won’t start until next month. But with all these negative reviews, I’ve been wondering if it really is a good idea to continue to work with them. 

Side note: the reviews I’ve been reading was pretty old and I have read a few good reviews.
