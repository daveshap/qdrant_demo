Is an ACL Sufficient for business firewall? I am a relatively new IT specialist for a small company (about 30 employees, 100 more seasonal.) Most of our systems have been outsourced to an IT company long ago, that handles licensing, VDI, PBX, security, routing, etc. I handle hardware, some networking, inventory control and imaging. I discovered on the phone with them that all our physical machine traffic is going out of a Cisco router that has been EOL for three years. In addition, there isn't any serious firewall capability. Our virtual CIO told me that it had an access control list, which is a sufficient firewall for us. I'm not very knowledgeable in internet security, but that just didn't seem right to me. We're dealing with sensitive census data, PHI and payroll systems on that network, and must be HIPPA compliant (which they are supposedly taking care of.) Email is cloud-based.Is an ACL \"good enough\" or should we be using a real firewall appliance? Thanks!
