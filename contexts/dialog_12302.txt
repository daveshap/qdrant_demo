EARL: Let me get it clear, Veronica. You want yourself a sweet homeboy for this T.V. show so you can show everybody what a loose, Martin Luther Cosby-lovng place Westerburg is.
VERONICA: Something like that. Will you do it?
EARL: Damn, you're a shrewd one. Shrewd.
VERONICA: I just want to show different kinds of people can get together and it doesn't have to be Vietnam. You don't get treated badly here do you?
EARL: I don't get treated at all, but hey, don't worry about it. I'll do your thing. It'll give my Mom a smile.
VERONICA: Things are going to change, Earl.
EARL: Uh-huh.
HEATHER DUKE: Guess who?
VERONICA: Heather.
