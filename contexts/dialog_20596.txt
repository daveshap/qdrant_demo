RAFE: I called my folks, then Colonel Doolittle. The Colonel sent a man to pick me up. They wanted to debrief me. I told the Colonel I needed to see somebody first, and he had a supply flight heading out in an hour. I've done a lot of talking. You haven't said anything.
EVELYN: I'm just...so amazed, so glad to know that you're okay. You are okay, aren't you?
RAFE: Nothing that won't heal. I guess.
EVELYN: It's been...so different, being so sure you were dead.
RAFE: I'm so sorry for what you must've gone through, but I'm back.
