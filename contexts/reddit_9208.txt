Just want to remind everyone that how much you spend on xmas gifts will not change anyone's opinion of you
At least those people whose opinions you value.

Vaguely coherent gift rant: My sister just sent me a gift idea for my grandma. It's a personalized fingerprint necklace. But the thing costs $110... Far beyond my budget. But it started me thinking about my Grandma, and gift giving.

 I think this goes for any Grandma, but she has lived a long time already, and I think she's experienced all that the material world can give her. But yet I feel like most people spend a lot of money on gifts for their grandma. I'm just spit-balling, but I am guessing grandmas don't *really* care about getting new stuff. They enjoy the time spent, the photos, the memories etc. 

Even for my parents, I feel like a weird obligation to spend more money on their gifts than say, my sister's gift. But after thinking about it a bit, it makes no sense. There is nothing they could want that they can't get already, so why should I over-extend myself to give them a gift that I deem 'expensive enough'. So don't try to live up to this fictitious expectation that you've set in your head as an acceptable amount to spend on someone's gift.

People you cherish and love should not give a shit how much you spent on their gifts, and if someone turns up their nose at your inexpensive gift, then that's a good indicator they are a shitty person.
