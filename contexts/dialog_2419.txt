RICK: This is it, lady. Last stop.
DEBBIE: Can't I just go with you guys?
RICK: Sorry, we got men's business to do. It's no place for a lady.
DEBBIE: Remember, you promised... no screwing around.
RICK: Did I promise that? I don't remember that...
DEBBIE: You're really pissing me off.
RICK: Okay, I promise... I swear on my mother's grave.
DEBBIE: Your mother's not dead.
RICK: Well, if I go back on my word, I'll kill her.
DEBBIE: Have a good time. Don't make it too late.
RICK: Anything you say, ma'am. Have a fun shower. Use soap.
DEBBIE: I love you.
O'NEILL: What's the matter?
RICK: Nothing... Let's get crazy!
RYKO: All right!
CHULO: When do the girls get to the party?
