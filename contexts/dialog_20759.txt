MRS. FINLEY: Yeah. Do I have a case?
JOE: Of course you have a case! Now, I want you to go with my assistant, Iris, and fill out some forms. She'll tell you about our fee arrangement. Mrs. Finley? Any back pain since the accident? Dizziness? Nightmares?
MRS. FINLEY: Now that you mention it...
JOE: Tell Iris all about it. Take good care of Mrs. Finley, Iris. Beckett, come in.
JOE: Jesus Christ, what happened to you?
ANDREW: I have AIDS.
JOE: Whoa-oh! Sorry, I...
ANDREW: It's okay. Can I sit down?
JOE: Uh, yeah.
