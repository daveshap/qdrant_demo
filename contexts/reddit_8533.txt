Does the President have the power to fire the Fed Chair, and is there anything in recent history where something similar has taken place?
Reports are coming out that Donald Trump has [considered firing Jerome Powell](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/22/trump-reportedly-wants-to-fire-fed-chair-powell.html). There appear to be conflicting opinions on whether he actually can do this. Some seem to think it would [likely be legal](https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/trump-considering-firing-fed-chair-jerome-powell-after-latest-rate-hike-report), but others place the President's powers in more doubt, like this quote from [a Bloomberg story](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-12-22/trump-said-to-discuss-firing-fed-s-powell-after-latest-rate-hike):

>It’s unclear how much legal authority the president has to fire Powell. The Federal Reserve Act says governors may be “removed for cause by the President.” Since the chairman is also a governor, that presumably extends to him or her, but the rules around firing the leader are legally ambiguous, as Peter Conti-Brown of the University of Pennsylvania notes in his book on Fed independence.

Other sources, [here](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/why-trump-cant-fire-powell-for-disagreement-over-monetary-policy-2018-10-11), and [here](https://apnews.com/847d1f81a7d04cec841d35ee26a42a2d), are even more pessimistic that the President's power extends this far, at least not without more cause than has currently been displayed. 

Is Trump actually able do this, and is there anywhere in history (US or otherwise) where something similar has happened or gives this precedence?
