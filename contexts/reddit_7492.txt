Defending tomorrow!
Holy cow guys, this is it. I am so nervous, but at the same time very excited. I have had such a rough time with this thesis and I can’t believe it’s almost over. 

That being said, I am terrified of failing and was wondering if any of you had any last minute tips? I think I am gonna run through everything a few more times aloud to really get the pace down and then I will stop for the day.

Post defense edit: I PASSED WITH ONLY MINOR REVISIONS! Thank you to those who wished me well wishes on this post! I’m gonna go sleep for three days straight
