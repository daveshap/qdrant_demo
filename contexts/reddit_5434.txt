Looking for advice
Hello Everybody,

I was wondering if anyone here works in transport in the UK?

I'm working as a transport supervisor for a transport company, and eventually i want to climb the ladder. I'm not in a hurry, but I would like to start preparing for it early  i guess. 

I know you need a CPC and an O Licence but i don't want to go through that just yet, so i was wondering if anyone knows where i can find some reading material related to this so i can go through it until i'm ready to do the CPC course? Like business and company law, financial management etc.

Also, is there a minimum number of years that i need to work in transport before being able to apply for a job as a manager?

Any help or advice will be very much appreciated :)
