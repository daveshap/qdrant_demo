Changing Text Color in Finder on Mojave Dark Mode? I recently switched over to Dark Mode, and for visual symmetry, I made my Finder window backgrounds dark grey (so that I don't have a black window with a white filled-in background. However, this makes the text quite hard to read -- is there any way to change (or simply invert) the text color for icon labels in Finder?Thanks for your help!
