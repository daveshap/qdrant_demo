PETER: I gather we’ve done business with a friend of yours?
LOMBARD: Have you?
PETER: The person who put us in touch seems to think so.
LOMBARD: I don’t recollect mentioning a friend.
PETER: Your lady friend did.
LOMBARD: The lady’s not a friend. She’s a whore. Someone at a special screening I attended mentioned certain goods could be got from an Austrian here in London. And not just movies.
PETER: And while visiting our fair city you... An Austrian?
LOMBARD: An Austrian.
PETER: An Austrian... Not much to go on, is it?
LOMBARD: Questions can amount to revelations. Now, I’d hate to think I was made to come here carrying a substantial amount of money in order to be subjected to a cross- examination. Mr Friedman led me to believe we had a deal. Do we?
PETER: Will you be alone? The merchandise. Is it just you or...
LOMBARD: I’ll be alone.
PETER: You must agree to be blindfolded... Just for the journey. It might appear unseemly - you’re the paying customer - but ordinarily clients come with some kind of endorsement.
