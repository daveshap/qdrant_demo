LOUISE: I have a savings account with about sixty-seven hundred dollars in it. Now I know you won't be able to get it out, but I'm good for it. I need that money. Can you wire me the sixty-seven hundred dollars and I'll pay you back? Please, I'm desperate.
JIMMY: What the fuck is going on?
LOUISE: Something real bad has happened and I can't tell you what, just that it's bad and I did it and I can't undo it. Can you help me?
JIMMY: Of course. Of course! Where? Can't I bring it to you? For God's sake, baby, please, just tell me what's happened, what could possibly be so bad?
