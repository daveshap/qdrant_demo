My[26F] life is going great but I’m lonely and I don’t feel like I’ll ever find that person
Hey guys. I’m just generally frustrated and I’m coming here to vent.

I haven’t dated someone since July of last year. It’s been a whole year. And it’s not because guys haven’t approached me, it’s because I haven’t found anyone even remotely interesting. And when I do, they don’t seem interested back.

I’m 26, I started a business last year and it’s just now starting to pick up. I’m doing better financially, living in my own apartment, confident in my looks (obviously to an extent because we all have our days), have great friends and family. I’m generally very happy. The only thing that upsets me is feeling really lonely most of the time.

Loneliness is taboo to talk about but we all experience it. I’ve tried online dating and it’s a disaster. The guys on there are mostly looking for random hook ups and I’m not. I’m dating for the long term.

The guys who do want to go out with me seem to be endlessly boring. A lot of them lack ambition, the ability to plan a decent date or basic conversational skills. When I do find a guy who has what I’d like in a partner (ambition, intelligence, kindness, etc), they don’t seem interested in ever meeting me in person.

I refuse to settle, but after a year without so much as dating someone for longer than 3 dates, I start to feel like I’ll never find my person. I won’t date anyone unless they add to my already full life and at the moment no one is making the cut. And it makes me sad sometimes.
