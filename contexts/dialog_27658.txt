ANNIE: Are you a friend of Mitch's?
MELANIE: No, not really.
ANNIE: I've been wanting a cigarette for the past twenty minutes, but I couldn't convince myself to stop. This 'tilling of the soil' can get a little compulsive, you know.
MELANIE: It's a lovely garden.
ANNIE: Thank you. It gives me something to do with my spare time. There's a lot of spare time in Bodega Bay. Did you plan on staying long?
MELANIE: No. Just a few hours.
ANNIE: You're leaving after you see Cathy?
MELANIE: Well... something like that. I'm sorry. I don't mean to sound so mysterious.
ANNIE: Actually, it's none of my business.
