Do you have a business card? Would you recommend having one as a grad student, and what do/would you include on it?
I’m an incoming PhD student thinking about getting business cards just in case an opportune moment arises. I have some side hustles that I would like to continue, which would mean building up a new (albeit smaller) client base. There’s also the chance for increased ease of networking and professional development, maybe?

I just would like to hear some thoughts on designing, having, and using them!
