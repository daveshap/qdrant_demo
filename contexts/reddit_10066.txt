PhD Funding - Where can I find it?
Hey, y’all! I just got accepted into a Higher Ed PhD program and I’m super excited. It’s at the institution I work at because I get some tuition benefits, but I’m honestly really hoping to go full-time at some point. From what I can tell, there are some scholarships available, but nothing as far as full-funding opportunities right now. I gather because the program has historically been mostly made up of people working full-time and attending part-time.

I feel silly because I have been googling a ton to find fellowship/scholarship opportunities that I qualify for, but am coming up short. Has anyone else had any luck finding anything?
