JOHNS: Look, we gotta think about everyone now -- the kid especially. How scared is she gonna be out there?
FRY: Oh, don't use her like that, for a smoke screen.
JOHNS: Smoke screen for what?
FRY: For your own fear.
JOHNS: Hey. Why don't you rag your hole for two seconds and let someone else come up with a plan that doesn't involve MASS SUICIDE?
FRY: How much you weigh, Johns?
JOHNS: What the hell's it matter?
FRY: How much?
JOHNS: 79 kilos.
FRY: Because you're 79 kilos of gutless white meat, and <u>that's</u> why you can't come up with a better plan.
RIDDICK: Think about that reward, Johns.
JOHNS: I'm willing to take a cut in pay.
RIDDICK: How 'bout a cut in your gut?
JOHNS: Oh, Trash Baby, you're gonna regret this.
IMAM: Please...this solves nothing...please....
FRY: They're afraid of our light. That means we don't have to be so afraid of them.
IMAM: And you're certain you can find the way back? Even in the dark?
FRY: No, I'm not. But <u>he</u> can.
