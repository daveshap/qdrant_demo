TOM: I've been doing some morning show stuff, but mostly radio -- that doesn't bother me. I'm in no rush for anything. It's just the snotty attitude, even if I have it coming, it's still...
BUDDY: Bad manners.
TOM: Yes. That's right.
BUDDY: I know...I mean you didn't do anything special for me tonight. You just had what I think are good manners, decency. And it really makes me want to be nice back and it has nothing to do with any homosexual thing. Honestly. Because I don't know if you've homosexual or not and -- you're not, are you?
TOM: No...no.
BUDDY: One's enough.
TOM: I really have to go.
BUDDY: Okay. At least let me show my appreciation. The Secretary of Labor is going to be indicted on Wednesday. For the graft thing he supposedly did before he was appointed.
TOM: What?
BUDDY: Yes, it's true. They're going to make it public Wednesday but isn't it a big deal for you to have it a day and a half early?
TOM: Yes. How do you know?
BUDDY: My roommate's very social -- somebody from Justice was over and...I always hear things before they happen. Hey, and from now on, so do you.
