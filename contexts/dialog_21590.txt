ELIZABETH: Hey....I was just telling everyone about how I was gonna bring this girl for you but you wouldn't let me do it.
BARRY: Hello everyone.
KAREN: Did you think that we'd all be looking at you?
BARRY: No, no, no.
KAREN: Well it's just not true. We wouldn't be looking at you -- why are you wearing this suit? Did you say hello to your brother in law's?
