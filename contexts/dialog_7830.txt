HARRY: Right.
LLOYD: Okay. Which one do you want?
HARRY: The one on the left.
LLOYD: Damn! What are the odds?
HARRY: What?
LLOYD: That's the one I wanted.
HARRY: She's one of a kind.
LLOYD: Try one in a million!
HARRY: Well, what should we do?
LLOYD: You take her.
HARRY: No Lloyd. Chicks are for fags - I'm not going to do it.
