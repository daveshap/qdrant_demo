I got drunk for the first time in over 6 years this weekend. My anxiety is now so bad, that I am considering suicide.
I haven't drank in many years. This weekend I got drunk. I don't know why I allowed myself to drink, I guess I am not as strong as I thought, and now my anxiety is out of control. It has been almost two days since I drank, but my anxiety is still so bad that I feel that I would rather die than experience one more day feeling this badly. 

I have attempted suicide twice in the past, the last time being 5 years ago. I really don't want to die, but can no longer live with near constant and debilitating anxiety. 

Has anyone ever experienced these feelings after using alcohol? Thanks for reading.

Edit: I don't think it is right to downvote posts about suicide. Can someone please tell me what I said in my post that was wrong? I am really sorry if I should not post here.
