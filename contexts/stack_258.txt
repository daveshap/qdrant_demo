TimeMachine/AFP extremely slow when accessing NAS over wifi we operate an 80TB QNAP NAS, both for storing bulk data as well as TimeMachine backups of our laptops. The NAS itself can sustain over 300 MByte/sec of write speeds when accessed from multiple ethernet-connected machines, and TimeMachine has decent performance (configured as AFP share).However when accessed over wifi, the performance drop is massive - it doesn't show any \"live\" speeds but leaving a laptop for 20 hours (no energy saving) and only 850MB of transferred data speaks enough. Granted, our network setup is a bit non-standard as our Cisco WLAN AP controller is at our central datacenter connected to our office via a 100/100 leased line and has to share traffic with other clients, but even under loaded conditions an SSH transfer to the NAS achieves ~5 MByte/sec.What exactly does TimeMachine do when using a network share? Is it possible that there are MTU fuck-ups somewhere along the connection, or does AFP require ultra low latency links (when over wifi, ping is 40ms)?
