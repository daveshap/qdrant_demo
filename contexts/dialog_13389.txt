SARAH: What is it, Eddie?
EDDIE: Nothin'. Want another drink?
SARAH: What do you want to tell me?
EDDIE: Well, I, uh, I'll be leaving town for a little while.
SARAH: For how long?
EDDIE: Oh, I don't know.
SARAH: A week? A year?
EDDIE: More like a week. Look, I'll be back.
SARAH: Sure. Let's go home.
