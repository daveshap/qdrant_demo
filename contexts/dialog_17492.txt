QUINCE: Well, I'm happy to tell you I've got good news. As I was telling Drew, I've been making a little hay while the Bontecou sun was shining -- two, possibly three new and boiling hot prospects for merger.
DREW: How did Bill react to the leads you've developed?
QUINCE: He was interested.
DREW: -- But he was concerned about the timing?
QUINCE: The timing -- yes. He says it's up to Joe.
DREW: 'It's up to Joe'?
QUINCE: That's what he said.
PARRISH: What is this?
ALLISON: Annie made them.
PARRISH: Who's Annie?
ALLISON: From La Rosette, only the greatest pastry chef in America. This is orange, from real Seville oranges. Lemon, on a mille-feuille crust, a little on the fanciful. And a while, nothing like a good old white cake, vanilla, with Angel food but some maroons shavings thrown in.
PARRISH: I don't like cake.
ALLISON: It's for the party, Dad --
PARRISH: Oh, the goddam party --
ALLISON: 'Goddam party'!
QUINCE: This is great, honey. The orange. Has it got a little vodka in it? Like that Finnish stuff, orange vodka -- Put your lips around this one, Bill. It's out of this world.
PARRISH: No thank you, Quince. I'm sorry, honey. I'm no good at this. Why don't you choose whatever cake you like?
