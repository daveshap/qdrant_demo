DUNBAR: I... I don't know...
PIKE: What don't you know?
DUNBAR: This is a lot of information to be getting... I have to think --
PIKE: There's no time to think, Ray, we gotta get out of here! You untie me, we grab the guns, get Kendall and Nunez, and make a run for it --
DUNBAR: No... no, we can just wait till we get back and then tell the M.P.'s --
PIKE: We wait and I'm a dead man. I got a black face, a criminal record, and over a hundred other cadets who'll testify how much I hated West -- my court martial will take six minutes. It's either me or them, Ray, and you gotta decide right now.
