MUNNY: Shit.
NED: How far kin you see?
THE KID: Far enough.
NED: We ain't goin' to Nebraska on no turtle hunt. A hundred yards?
THE KID: More.
NED: See that scrub oak yonder?
THE KID: Fuck you.
NED: He's blind, for Chri...
THE KID: I ain't blind, you asshole.
MUNNY: Now hold on, boys, hold on. Now, Kid, you kin see fifty yards, can't you?
THE KID: Bet your ass I kin see fifty yards an' I kin shoot this sonofabitch...
MUNNY: Easy, Kid, easy. Now, you hear that, Ned? The Kid can see fifty yards fine, hear?
NED: Jesus.
MUNNY: Fifty yards ain't bad. Guess we better get along.
