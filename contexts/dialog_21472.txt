WESTLEY: Can you move at all?
BUTTERCUP: Move? You're alive. If you want, I can fly.
WESTLEY: I told you, I would always come for you." Why didn't you wait for me?"
BUTTERCUP: Well ... you were dead.
WESTLEY: Death cannot stop true love. All it can do is delay it for a while.
BUTTERCUP: I will never doubt again.
WESTLEY: There will never be a need.
THE KID: Oh no. No, please.
GRANDFATHER: What is it? What's the matter? --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 56.
THE KID: They're kissing again, do we have to hear the kissing part?
GRANDFATHER: Someday, you may not mind so much.
THE KID: Skip on to the Fire Swamp -- that sounded good.
GRANDFATHER: Oh. You're sick, I'll humor you. So now, where were we here? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Ah. Oh. Okay. Westley and Buttercup raced along the ravine floor.
