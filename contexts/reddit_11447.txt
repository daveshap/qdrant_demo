My dog won't make it past 5 if my step-dad keeps feeding him the way he does
We have a pug named Otis, and my stepdad refuses to feed him properly. He regurgitates food into his mouth, and has gotten Otis to where you have to feed him kibble by kibble. He refuses to eat out of a bowl. 

Now, he refuses the dog food unless he's absolutely starving, because he wants people food and treats only. My stepdad feeds him treats like it's nothing. Treats no longer mean "good boy!" in this household. They've become a huge chunk of Otis's diet. When I ask him why he just showers Otis in treats, he says "Otis really wants one!" 

Now the people food...candy, chocolate, ice cream, anything on his plate...just everything. "A little bit won't hurt." Since when did "a little bit" mean the majority of his diet? 

His excuse for all this? "He's gonna die sometime, at least he'll be happy when he dies at 5." This is the same guy who always says "I want Otis to live forever." 

I've tried talking to him about this but he refuses to listen.
