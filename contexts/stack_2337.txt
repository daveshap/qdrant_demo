Minecraft Pushable Blocks I am making a legend of zelda minecraft custom map, and zelda games have pushable blocks, so I've been busting my head for a long time trying to figure this out, and I couldn\u2019t, so I turned to arqade for help. If you can help me that will be great.P.S.: I\u2019m in minecraft version 1.12.2
