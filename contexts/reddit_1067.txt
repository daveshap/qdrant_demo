I don't give a shit about "leaving my comfort zone", I just want to feel comfortable right now
I've never in my life *not* felt anxious, so why the hell should I force myself to keep "facing my fears" if it does nothing to help me? Fuck it, I just want to feel okay right now. I don't want to expand my horizons or whatever, I just want to stick to things that make me feel okay-anxiety wise, and if that means staying at home most of the time, then it's fine. I don't give a fuck.


EDIT: I was going to delete this in the morning, but it really blew up, so I'm leaving it, lol. 


For what it's worth, I know this isn't exactly the healthiest mindset, but I'm so goddamn tired of expanding so much energy on *trying* with nothing to show for it.
