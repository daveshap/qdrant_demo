MADOX: Certainly not.
KATHARINE: I insist. There clearly isn't room for us all, I'm the least able to dig, and I'm not one of the walking wounded. Those are facts. Besides, if I remain it's the most effective method of persuading my husband to abandon whatever he's doing and rescue us. It's hard to argue with this logic.
ALMÁSY: What's this?
KATHARINE: I thought you might paste them into your book.
ALMÁSY: We took several photographs, there's no need.
KATHARINE: I'd like you to have them.
ALMÁSY: There's really no need. This is just a scrapbook. I should feel obliged. Thank you.
KATHARINE: And that would be unconscionable, I suppose, to feel any obligation? Yes. Of course it would.
ALMÁSY: You should come into the shelter.
KATHARINE: I'm quite all right, thank you.
ALMÁSY: Look over there.
KATHARINE: What am I looking at?
ALMÁSY: See what's happening to them - the stars.
KATHARINE: They're so untidy. I'm just trying to rearrange them.
ALMÁSY: In an hour there will be no stars. The air is filling with sand.
KATHARINE: This is not very good, is it?
ALMÁSY: No.
KATHARINE: Shall we be all right?
ALMÁSY: Yes. Absolutely.
KATHARINE: Yes is a comfort. Absolutely is not.
