I (24F) just love how my boyfriend (27M) says ‘we’ all the time
I think my friends are probably sick of hearing how much I love my boyfriend, but I honestly think he is the sweetest person in the world. Over the weekend we went on a road trip to his hometown with some friends and I noticed something that made me so happy. Whenever my boyfriend talks about his future, he always says ‘we’ he might be talking about something simple like next weekends plans or something more serious like his next house, but he’ll always say ‘yeah *we’re* free next weekend’ or ‘maybe *we* could live in ___’. I love the way he does it as it makes me feel so important and loved. 

While we were away, we had a bonfire and were all sitting outside drinking. I got tired and decided to go to bed, leaving my boyfriend outside with my friend. The next morning she pulled me aside to tell me how sweet he is and that he was absolutely gushing about how much he loves me and told her how he really wants to get engaged next year and adores me so much...it made my heart melt knowing how serious he is about me and how badly he wants our future together. 

I truly think I’m the luckiest girl in the world, he is so perfect in every single way and I can’t wait for our future together
