REGGIE: Yes -- ?
BARTHOLOMEW: Mrs. Lampert? -- Bartholomew. I've spoken to Washington, Mrs. Lampert --
REGGIE: Go ahead, Mr. Bartholomew -- I'm listening.
BARTHOLOMEW: I told them what you said -- about this man being Carson Dyle's brother. I asked them what they knew about it and they told me -- you're not gonna like this, Mrs. Lampert -- they told me Carson Dyle has no brother.
REGGIE: Are you sure there's no mistake?
BARTHOLOMEW: None whatsoever. Please, Mrs. Lampert -- be careful.
