MRS. MURPHY: Good morning. You unpack your stuff yet?
DADE: Mm-hmm.
MRS. MURPHY: Up all night again, huh?
DADE: Can this wait until both my eyes are open, please?
MRS. MURPHY: Can I cut the electricity to his room so he'll sleep normal hours? He's been playing with his computer all night for a solid week. Well yes, he could be playing with himself. Mmm hmm. Yes I'll ask. Dade, you like girls, don't you?
DADE: Well, yeah, I just haven't found one as charming as you yet.
MRS. MURPHY: You haven't been doing anything stupid, right, Dade? Right, Dade?!
DADE: Right, mom. And I'm still a virgin!
