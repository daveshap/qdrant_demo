Simultaneous equations and instrument selection The demand curve $$P_i= b_1 +b_2 q_i +b_3p_{sub,i}+b_4p_{com,i}+b_5w_i+u_{i1}$$The supply curve$$P_i= a_1 +a_2 q_i +a_3p_{sub,i}+a_4p_{com,i}+a_5w_i+u_{i1}$$Which instruments would you use to instrument $q_i$ in each of the two equations? And which restriction should I apply in order to estimate first one as demand and second one as supply curve?$p_{sub,i}$ is the price of the substitute of the good i$p_{com,i}$ is the price of the complement of the good i$w_i$ the wage$p$ the price of the good i$q$ is the quantity of good i. My idea is that (maybe it is wrong. I am not sure)In the demand equation, wage is the instrument to q. In the supply curve, $p_{com}$ is the instrument to q. What do you think?
