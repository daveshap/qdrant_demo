I left a stable, stagnant job a year ago for career growth, then got let go from that position after 8 months. Now I fear I will never work in my field again. RANT
As the title said I had a stable job in as a pharmaceutical manufacturing engineer at a smaller pharmaceutical company in MA for 4.5 years. The pay was below market rate and not much opportunity for growth, but had great job security. However, I got antzy and wanted better career growth. I found a role that promised that with a $20k pay increase, so I left my comfortable but stagnant role and took a chance with a new role.

This new role did not work out. The role was different than advertised and I could not adjust well to it. I was let go in June. I wasn't really distraught over it, because I felt I could pick myself up quickly. Plus the job market was "hot" according to recruiters.

I have not been able to find an equivalent job since. I have had multiple interviews with companies large and small. However, none have yielded a suitable offer. Now I'm approaching 6 months of unemployment and I fear I am being shut out of the job market because I made one mistake one year ago to leave a comfortable job to "find my market value".

Sometimes I miss working in retail where you don't have to deal with "cultural fit" bullshit and recruiting agencies who just farm you for contacts and throw you to the curb and tell you your experience is worthless.
