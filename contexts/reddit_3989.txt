So do people go on dates anymore?
I mean like damn, people asking for a date is like offending everyone's great great ancestors. New flash- dating is supposed to be fun! I feel like this generation is so scared of commitment, they cannot even go on one or two dates.  
What im saying is, in 2019, lets bring back dating. Its OKAY to ask someone on a date. Its okay to reject- to say "hey Im not feeling it, I wish you the best though" instead of ghosting. In 2019, Lets bring back dating 👍. Anyone else agree?
