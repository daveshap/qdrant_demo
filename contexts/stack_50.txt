Why does High Sierra quit all my programs when I lock and close the laptop? After installing High Sierra, whenever I lock and close my MacBook Pro (2015), all my programs have quit once I open it again. Chrome will often show an \"unexpectedly closed\" message, which seems to indicate that it was not a graceful logout but a sudden forced quit of all programs.It doesn't happen if I lock the computer and immediately unlock - only, apparently, if I close the laptop and come back after a while (sometimes as little as 5-10 minutes).Why would this be happening?High Sierra also freezes for around 5 seconds when I try to Lock the computer before actually locking, which is extremely slow and did not happen in Sierra.I tried to ask this on Apple forums and got the message: \"You are not allowed to create or update this content.\"Additional info:- I'm running latest version of macOS (10.13.1).- When I unlock the Mac after this kind of mass-crash I often get the Optimizing Your Mac notification- It just happened to me again after closing the laptop for about 2 minutes- Twice today, instead of a mass crash, the Mac has just displayed a black screen (though the keyboard lights are on) and I was forced to restart.  (This also happened intermittently with Sierra but not usually 2x in one day.)
