DAVID: I like your hat.
VIVIAN: Huh? Oh... yeah. S'okay? Uhm... how're... business things going.
DAVID: Let's not talk about it, it's too depressing. Come on, I'll show you Thunder.
VIVIAN: Please, we hardly know each other.
DAVID: Thunder's a horse. Come on.
DAVID: Hey, big guy, you getting tired, yet? I am. This is Vivian. You two been together long? You and Edward?
VIVIAN: No.
DAVID: Hope to be?
VIVIAN: It's... it's not like that.
DAVID: I see. Well. Maybe that means you'd have lunch with me sometime then.
VIVIAN: You don't know anything about me.
DAVID: I'd like to find out. You don't know anything about me either. That's why people have lunch.
STUCKEY: Fill me in on this. How'd you and Vivian meet?
EDWARD: We just did.
STUCKEY: Come on, you can tell me. I sure would like to know where a guy runs into a girl as attractive as this.
EDWARD: The night I left your house, I was lost. I was looking for directions.
STUCKEY: And you just happened to run into her. Great. What's she do? She work?
EDWARD: Yes...
STUCKEY: Doing what?
EDWARD: Vivian's in sales.
STUCKEY: Sales, really? That's great. What does she sell?
EDWARD: Why do you want to know?
STUCKEY: Hear me out. I've known you a long time. I see a difference in you this week. Like that tie. I'm suddenly wondering if this girl's not the difference. Especially when I see her talking with David Kross.
EDWARD: She met him at dinner last night... I like this tie.
STUCKEY: So now they're best friends? Edward, this girl appears out of nowhere and now I see her talking to a guy whose company we're trying to buy. It's too convenient.
EDWARD: You're being ridiculous.
STUCKEY: Industrial espionage is not ridiculous. Edward, how do you know she hasn't attached herself to you so she can bring Kross back information?
EDWARD: Christ, Bill, she's not a spy, she's a hooker. I picked her up off Hollywood Boulevard.
