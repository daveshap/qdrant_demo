AMY: So beautiful, Irena. So beautiful.
IRENA: You wanted to share this moment with me.
AMY: It stands so still.
IRENA: Because it knows it can move with the swiftness of strong wind.
AMY: I can sea its breath in the cold.
IRENA: It's a warm breath -- warm and strong â€” warmed by the sunlight that shone on the deer's back in the hot summer; sweet with leaves and mosses.
AMY: May I pet the deer?
IRENA: It is wildness and freedom. No one can touch it.
AMY: I want to touch it.
AMY: There was a deer on the other side of the fence.
EDWARD: It's a hard winter. All the animals are bold as brass, coming down into the streets for food. You'll see a lot of deer this winter.
