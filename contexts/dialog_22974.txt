THEO: Are you okay?
CINDY: I think so.
THEO: Come on. We better get you cleaned up.
CINDY: I'm telling you, it was possessed.
PROFESSOR: Theo, did you see the animal?
THEO: No, I just heard the commotion, and when I got there I guess it was gone.
CINDY: What, you think I did this to myself?
PROFESSOR: No, I'm just saying cats are known to be very territorial animals, and it is likely it did attack, but it doesn't mean it was possessed. Maybe the two of you should sleep together.
CINDY: What are you getting at, Professor?
PROFESSOR: Only that if this cat did attack, he's less likely to come back if the two of you were, let's say, together. Come on, it's college. Time for you two to experiment.
