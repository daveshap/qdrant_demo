Sexually confused, friendless, and frustrated
I’m really not sure how to start this, but here goes.

This year, after hating my time at summer camp and making no friends, is the year I’m going away from home. 

All throughout high school I’ve gotten straight As, done well on the violin, played some video games. So, instead of focusing on my grades this year and especially this semester, I’ve decided to focus on the fact that I don’t enjoy my life at all. 

First came my sexuality. I’ve always been someone who’s super conscientious - always want to fix myself, never really enjoying the moment. The thing is, when I was around 12, I started paying more attention to guys and, even though I’d had a gay moment or two as a kid, I totally denied it. Now, a lot of gay kids do that, but the problem is that after forcing myself not to look at guys for a summer, I literally lost my whole sex drive. I feel totally confused. I know it’s useless to stress more, but I just can’t get the stress off my mind. I’m constantly worried about what I’m attracted to. And I wonder if being gay is even worth it or what I want. 

On top of that, I have absolutely no friends. I have 2 people I talk to at school, both of which I feel like Im just trying to please so I’m not totally alone. I try my hardest to relate to them, but I just end up a) stressed out b) not enjoying talking to them or c) feeling alone once they reject me. I feel useless. I don’t even really feel a drive to hang out with anyone. It just stresses me out and is no fun. I’m totally quiet in groups.

Then came the frustration. I am so freaking frustrated with all of this. Why can’t I have friends? Why can’t I have a normal sexuality - gay or straight (I want to be with someone!)? Why can’t I enjoy playing my violin, or being with friends, or just doing anything in my life? I feel like I try so hard and stress so much and it goes nowhere...

I feel like a total moron posting this, but here goes. Thanks for reading.
