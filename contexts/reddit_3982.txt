Online dating sucks for everyone, not just guys
I see a lot of posts on here about how online dating is not for guys and only girls have any luck finding a lot of dates. 

I (24F) go through weeks where I might get one match, maybe two if it's close to a holiday.  An issue I have with matches is guys not messaging for days at a time, then saying sorry, I was busy for "x" reason. Also, most of the messages I receive are guys "complimenting" my body and messaging inappropriate or unwanted sexual advances without any provocation. 

For every good date I actually have, there are 5 that are horrible... I'm not talking about no chemistry or had a difficult time conversing, I'm talking about comments that make me cringe and shutter or inappropriate touching. 

So, next time you're frustrated about not getting matches, please remember, this sucks for everyone. 

EDIT: I am not saying that it sucks the same way for everyone. Men and woman may or may not have different challenges with online dating. This was a vent directed towards people who think if you are even a remotely attractive woman, online dating is an all you can eat buffet. Online dating sucks for everyone in one way or another. 

Thank you to those that gave actual advice and showed concern. You're the real MVPs.
