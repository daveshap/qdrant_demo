KORBEN: Other than that... You all right?
MOTHER: ...And now you're making fun of me? I'm warning you! If you don't take me after all these years of sacrifice, I'll never forgive you!!
KORBEN: I'm coming!. Ma, what're you talking about?
MOTHER: I get it! You want to make me beg, is that it?
KORBEN: All I want is an explanation! I just got in, I lost my job. I smashed my cab. I got mugged, but other than that everything's peachy, Ma, thanks for asking!! Now settle down and explain to me calmly..
MOTHER: You just won a trip, you dolt! Ten days in Fhloston Paradise for two!
KORBEN: Ma. If I'd won, I'd know about it. Someone would have notified me.
MOTHER: They've been blaring out your name on the radio for the last hour, blockhead!
