How normal is miscommunication/disorganization in a company?
I've worked at a non-profit for about two years, and the one thing I've noticed about this company is that none of its employees have any idea what it does as a whole. I routinely hear from clients that some of my co-workers told them completely wrong information about our programs. I actually got cursed out today by a client who'd been told one thing by a co-worker only to have me tell her something completely different. I always verify any information with my boss, but it's clear that my co-workers (most of whom work at a different location) don't do the same. I'll tell my boss about these issues without dropping names, and at our monthly meetings she'll go over what's right and what's wrong. The problem? Nobody ever seems to remember what she says at these meetings, and the same problems happen all over again.

My boss herself is disorganized; she never remembers what she did or didn't train/tell us. Occasionally, she'll come up to me and go "Hey, did you complete this project I told you about last month?" She NEVER tells me about these projects before they're due. At first, I'd thought I'd just forgotten, but I consider myself to be a pretty decent organizer/planner, and after the fourth or fifth time this happened, I assumed that I wasn't to blame. 

Some of my co-workers have started calling/messaging me whenever they have questions, which is fine; I've made it clear to them that they can. But everyone in my department has been working here significantly longer than I have, so I'm just confused why I seem to know more about our agency than they do.

I was looking to leave my job before the world started falling apart. If things ever go back to normal, I'm outta here. 

This is the first "real" job I've ever had, and I just want to know: is this level of disorganization normal in many work companies? 

**TLDR: Just read the title.**
