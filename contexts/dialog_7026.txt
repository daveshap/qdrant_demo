TALBY: Doolittle, Doolittle, where are you?
DOOLITTLE: Here I am. I think I'm spinning... We're both falling, Talby, in opposite directions, away from each other. My -- my jetpack's gone.
TALBY: What happened, Doolittle?
DOOLITTLE: Bomb must have gone off inside the ship. Nothing we can do about it now. Hey, it looks like... the skipper. He made it. Commander Powell made it!
POWELL: Men... men... what happened, men?
DOOLITTLE: Yeah, the skipper always was lucky.
DOOLITTLE: Looks like I'm headed for the planet, Talby. Going right toward it.
TALBY: When you fall, Doolittle, if there's anyone down there on the planet, somebody may see you. They may see you coming down. What a beautiful way to die... as a falling star...
DOOLITTLE: Guess you're right.
