GITTES: How much do you owe me, Curly?
CURLY: Oh, gee, Mr. Gittes we're going out tomorrow. I know you been real good about it but my cousin Auggie's sick.
GITTES: Forget it. How would you like to pay me off by taking a couple of passengers to Ensenada... you'd have to leave tonight.
CURLY: I don't know...
GITTES: I might be able to squeeze an extra seventy-five bucks out of it for you. Maybe an even hundred.
CURLY: Plus what I owe you?
GITTES: I'll throw that in too.
CURLY: Okay, you got yourself a boat.
GITTES: Tell Mrs. Mulwray to wait for half an hour after you get there. Then if I don't show, take her down to the boat.
CURLY: You sure this is okay?
GITTES: Curly, you know how long I been in business.
