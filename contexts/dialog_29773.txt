CLARENCE: What?
ELVIS: Can you live with it?
CLARENCE: Live with what?
ELVIS: With that son-of-a-bitch walkin' around breathin' the same air as you? And gettin' away with it every day. Are you haunted?
CLARENCE: Yeah.
ELVIS: You wanna get unhaunted?
CLARENCE: Yeah.
ELVIS: Then shoot 'em. Shoot 'em in the face. And feed that boy to the dogs.
CLARENCE: I can't believe what you're tellin' me.
ELVIS: I ain't tellin' ya nothin'. I'm just sayin' what I'd do.
CLARENCE: You'd really do that?
ELVIS: He don't got no right to live.
CLARENCE: Look, Elvis, he is hauntin' me. He doesn't deserve to live. And I do want to kill him. But I don't wanna go to jail for the rest of my life.
ELVIS: I don't blame you.
CLARENCE: If I thought I could get away with it -
ELVIS: Killin' 'em's the hard part. Gettin' away with it's the easy part. Whaddaya think the cops do when a pimp's killed? Burn the midnight oil tryin' to find who done it? They couldn't give a flyin' fuck if all the pimps in the whole wide world took two in the back of the fuckin' head. If you don't get caught at the scene with the smokin' gun in your hand, you got away with it.
