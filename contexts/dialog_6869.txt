SEBASTIAN: Alone again. What are you up to today?
ANNETTE: I'm doing some volunteer work.
SEBASTIAN: Need any company?
ANNETTE: You? Volunteer? I don't think so.
SEBASTIAN: I don't know? Maybe I'd like it. I'm trying to change here. You could be supportive.
ANNETTE: Okay.
SEBASTIAN: Babe, you're looking at the next Mother Teresa.
