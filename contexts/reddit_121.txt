Should I wear coloured contacts to school? How would people react? How would you react? Is it considered a part of makeup?
Recently I have bought some coloured contacts because I don’t like the brown colour of my eyes. I am also joining a new school however, I do know some of the people that already go there. What happens if they think I’m weird? Should I just not bother?
