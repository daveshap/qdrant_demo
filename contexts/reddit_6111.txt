Advice about working for a construction company. And maybe about life in general.
Hi so I'm in highschool but now we are doing online learning and I have a lot of free time to do stuff. I applied to a couple jobs and a construction company I applied to wants to set up an interview for a general labor position. I was wondering if I should pursue this or just go back to work with my summer job. I'm 17 and havent worked in construction before but it could be interesting and I have done manual labor previously as a job and it wasn't bad. I think it wasn't that bad because the business was a family operated and small. And I had a decent amount of downtime to rest between lifting heavy things or helping fix things. Any advice is appreciated thank you.
