CHARLOTTE: I'd call it stupid at any time.
RALPH: Well, that's just how stupid I am. When you go riding, it will be with me. And if it's with someone else, you can make it a permanent arrangement.
CHARLOTTE: So that's the way it is?
RALPH: That's the way I feel about it.
CHARLOTTE: I'm glad you told me. Good night, Mr. Burton.
