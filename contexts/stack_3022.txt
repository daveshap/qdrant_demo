Is the two events of an orbiting moon of Jupiter added together to calculate the actual moment? An observer on earth watching the orbit of a moon around Jupiter.Jupiter is at it's farthest distance from earth roughly 601 million miles which takes light roughly 54 minutes to arrive to earth. When the event of the moon during the observation of the moons orbit passes behind Jupiter the observer views the event happening 54 minutes in the past and the event of the light reappearing at 54 minutes in the past. So does the observer on earth view the whole event 108 minutes in the past for each orbit observed?
