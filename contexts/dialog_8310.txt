GIN: We going somewhere?
MAC: Possibly.
GIN: Maybe I should drive this time.
MAC: Maybe you should go buy yourself some clothes.
MAC: Very nice.
GIN: Not a word.
GIN: You want me to pick up a painting?
MAC: Quite a good one. A Monet. Not major, but it is Giverney.
GIN: I'm not here to run errands. I'm here for the Mask.
MAC: If I can't trust you to pick up a painting, how can I trust you about the Mask?
GIN: It's a test.
MAC: That's my girl.
GIN: Fine. What do I do?
MAC: It's simple. You pick up the painting, you pay for it with this debit card.
GIN: How much am I paying?
MAC: I'm paying...one point five million and change. I hate round numbers.
