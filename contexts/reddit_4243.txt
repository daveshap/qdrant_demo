[22M] Any advice for a guy who can't get any dates?
I've tried every free dating site but have never got a match or reply. When I was at college I joined social clubs, such as the drama club, but I never met any women who were interested. I have been clubbing many times to try get my first kiss and/or have some casual fun but again no women were interested. 

In terms of looks, I'd say I'm average. I workout, have a trendy haircut and always make sure my hygiene and clothes are on point. In terms of personality, I'm an easy going, friendly guy. I enjoy movies, music, exploring the world of food and most importantly hanging out with friends.

Any advice would be much appreciated.
