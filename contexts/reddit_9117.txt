Do not underestimate the effect of working a few extra hours a week. Every dollar of high interest debt you pay now will save roughly two dollars in the long run. 10-12 hours extra a week can pay off $10000 in one year by eliminating $5000 in future interest, or take nearly a year off your mortgage
Ever wonder if taking a second job or extra shifts is really worth it? Wonder if your spouse working a light job will really help? 

If you have high interest debt like credit cards, the answer is absolutely yes! 

At the average credit card rate of 15% or higher, every dollar you pay now saves 2 dollars by the time you pay it off. So that extra $7.75 or $10 per hour becomes $15.50 or $20 per hour when you take into effect how much it saves you when you put it towards paying off that high interest debt. 

Even if you don't have high interest debt and you have a decent mortgage, over the life of a 20 or 30 year mortgage you pay nearly $2 for every dollar you took out. 

So paying an extra $5000 a year up front from a 10 hour a week second job will end up saving you nearly $10,000, or almost a year of payments for every year you work the second job.

If you work an extra 10 hours a week for 10 years and put that towards the average mortgage, it will save you 10 years of payments for the equivalent of only 2.5 years of full time work. 

So yes, if you work a little extra and put that towards your debt, you can dramatically improve your debt situation and free up years of your life in the future. 

It DOES make a difference. Don't let anyone tell you it doesn't.
