ARTHUR: Look, Bobby, I don't know what happened, and I don't want to know what happened, but something's up.
BOBBY: What are you talking about?
ARTHUR: Maxie wants me to replace you on the job tomorrow. He wants you to come by the office today.
BOBBY: They were grabbing her fucking ass --
ARTHUR: Hey. I don't know, I don't want to know. Far as I'm concerned, you're a good kid. I got news, though, without you here I can't keep on your friend. I got enough people pretending to sweep.
BOBBY: Do me a favor, Arthur, keep him on til I see what's happening.
ARTHUR: Good luck.
BOBBY: Hi, uh, excuse me. I'm here to see Mr. Reuben.
AUDREY: You're Bobby, right?
BOBBY: Yeah.
AUDREY: Good afternoon, Bobby. I'll let Max know you're here.
AUDREY: He'll be a minute, hon. You want some coffee?
BOBBY: No thank you.
AUDREY: You sure? I just made it.
BOBBY: No, thank you. I'm good. Thanks.
