BUGGIN' OUT: It's so nice to see a family hanging out together.
MOOKIE: We're not hanging out. I'm being escorted back to work.
JADE: That's not even true. I just want a slice.
BUGGIN' OUT: Jade, you don't know this, but I'm organizing a boycott of Sal's Famous Pizzeria.
JADE: What did he do this time?
BUGGIN' OUT: Y'know all those pictures he has hanging on the Wall of Fame?
JADE: So?
BUGGIN' OUT: Have you noticed something about them?
JADE: No.
MOOKIE: Yo, I'm gone.
JADE: I'll see ya there.
