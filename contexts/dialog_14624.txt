KATHRYN: You look like an orange worm.
PHILIP: Shark bait. Draws them over for closeups.
KATHRYN: What in hell is that?
PHILIP: Lunch for Whitey. Something to munch on in case things get dicey.
KATHRYN: We're taking that shark alive!
PHILIP: Let's hope he knows that.
KATHRYN: I know it and I will not go down into this lagoon as long as you carry that!
PHILIP: Why?
KATHRYN: Because I don't trust you, that's why.
MIKE: You set that thing off down there, you don't know what will happen.
PHILIP: Precisely.
KATHRYN: I insist you get rid of that bomb.
PHILIP: Afraid I can't do that.
KATHRYN: You're supposed to film it, not turn it to hash!
PHILIP: Look, Doctor, this isn't one of your pet porpoises we're after. It's a torpedo of muscle. Murderous expertise! I've seen bleeding sharks try to eat themselves! Don't be so concerned about them. Worry about yourself.
