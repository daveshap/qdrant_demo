DR. DREYFUSS: Good evening, Baxter.
BUD: Hi, Doc. Had a late call?
DR. DREYFUSS: Yeah. Some clown at Schrafft's 57th Street ate a club sandwich, and forgot to take out the toothpick.
BUD: Oh. 'Bye, Doc.
DR. DREYFUSS: Say, Baxter -- the way you're belting that stuff, you must have a pair of cast-iron kidneys.
BUD: Oh, that's not me. It's just that once in a while, I have some people in for a drink.
DR. DREYFUSS: As a matter of fact, you must be an iron man all around. From what I hear through the walls, you got something going for you every night.
BUD: I'm sorry if it gets noisy --
DR. DREYFUSS: Sometimes, there's a twi-night double-header. A nebbish like you!
BUD: Yeah. Well -- see you, Doc.
DR. DREYFUSS: You know, Baxter -- I'm doing some research at the Columbia Medical Center -- and I wonder if you could do us a favor?
BUD: Me?
DR. DREYFUSS: When you make out your will -- and the way you're going, you should -- would you mind leaving your body to the University?
BUD: My body? I'm afraid you guys would be disappointed. Good night, Doc.
DR. DREYFUSS: Slow down, kid.
