EMIL: You can't kill me. You're not a cop. Just fireman with a gun. I bet you never shot anybody in your life.
JORDY: You'll be my first.
EMIL: C'mon. Pull the trigger. Do it. Oh, look, you're sweating. You don't have the balls.
JORDY: Get down on your knees.
JORDY: Where's your partner?
EMIL: The Sheraton! On Broadway! Room 210. Go get Oleg. He'll kill you.
