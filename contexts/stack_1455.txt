Modifying existing PCB design of nodeMCU I am looking for a way to modify existing nodeMCU PCB layout. I want to re-build it from scratch and add more components to it namely 0.96dpi LED display and few buttons. I want to also change the existing dimensions of the PCB Board. That means I need a project file, whoes components placement can be modified. I am using Eagle for PCB designing.P.S I can't use genral purpose PCB for a fully fledged working Prototype.
