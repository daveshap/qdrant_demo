If you collected unemployment in 2018 don't use TurboTax.
There are a lot of tax posts around about how to get your taxes done free in person, but I wanted to share this info if you're like me and prefer to do them myself at home.

TurboTax changed what forms are about to be filed for free and the 1099G you get from government rebates and unemployment payments is not one of them. They will charge you $39.99 to file.

H&R Block, on the other hand, will not charge you for that same paperwork. There is no fee for using the free version, and you can save a copy of your return at the end for your records. I did two sets of taxes yesterday and neither one cost anything but my time.
