When to expect Internship background check?
Hello, I accepted my summer internship offer on November 11. I got the obligatory "Welcome to company" email on November 18 that gives you the graphic to post on Linkedin to post regarding your new job. However, I still haven't been contacted regarding the background check, which my offer says it is contingent upon. Should I keep looking for internships while I wait for this to be cleared? Should I ask HR about my background check status? The company is a subsidary of a large company.
