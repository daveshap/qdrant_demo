Minority Governments in Germany
The 2017 Federal Election in Germany saw [major losses for the CDU/CSU and and the SPD, while minor political parties such as the FDP and AfD made significant gains](https://www.economist.com/blogs/kaffeeklatsch/2017/09/first-results). After receiving the [lowest share of the vote since the Second World War](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-09-24/merkel-wins-fourth-term-as-main-parties-suffer-historic-setbacks), the SPD lead by Martin Schulz decided to [go into opposition and not renew its 4 year assosiaction with the CDU/CSU](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-09-24/merkel-wins-fourth-term-as-main-parties-suffer-historic-setbacks).

This has lead to talks these past few days wherin high ranking officials from both parties came together to strike a new deal in order to effectively form a government, though there has been serious backlash from within the SPD leading to citizens and high ranking party officials [voicing their doubts on the German news service, Tagesschau.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2yrPCiaV8M)


I don't know how these talks will turn out, I'm not a fortune teller, but in hearing and reading this news I realized I really didn't know what would happen if the talks fell through and a coalition (whether the Grand Coalition or the Jamaica Coalition) wasn't formed. I'm not familiar with the Grundgesetz, and I don't know what is and isn't possible within the German government, which leads me to my questions:

**What happens in the German government if no party can form a majority?** Are minority governments possible given German law? I can't find anything references the formation of a minority government since German reunification, so I assume there hasn't been one. Am I correct in assuming there hasn't been one though? And if that's the case, was it because such a thing was unnecessary or impossible?

**Furthermore, if the existence of minority governments is possible in the German system, what are they like?** Do they share similarities with other nations' minority governments, such as in the United Kingdom or the Netherlands, or are German minority governments unlike all others?

Thanks for your time.
