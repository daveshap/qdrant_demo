I got stood up and I feel pretty crappy.
Let met preface this by saying I realize this is a minor issue (that will certainly pass) compared to what other people deal with, but I still feel really crappy.  

So this has never happened to me before and it feels strange. I had made plans with a girl to grab drinks last night. She wanted to bring her roommate (she seemed pretty shy so this seemed normal, and I'd bring my roommate too). Anyway, on Friday, we set up a place and a time, etc. Saturday night, she texted me a handful of times to let me know she was on her way and to see if I was there yet. Obviously she doesn't come to the bar. I guess I just don't get why (1) she would give me her number, (2) set up a time and place and tell me she was coming, and (3) if she's not interested, why not just tell me? It doesn't seem like it should be so difficult. I'm super embarrassed. I sat there with my roommate while currently getting stood up. I feel really stupid, and I'm not one who feels stupid very often.
