After HS anxiety
I'm sorry if this isn't very detailed, but I'm a 18 m in my senior year of highschool and I have no idea what I'm going to do after I graduate and it's happening in 5 months! I've thought about joining the Army or any of the other armed services but that's not for me, not that I'm lazy or anything, I'm just too sensitive for it, and I probably won't make it past basic. I thought about doing college to but I don't think I'll be able to handle the work load. I'm sorry if I rambled on but it's stressing me out.
