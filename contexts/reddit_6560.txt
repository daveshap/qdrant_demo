Job has no breaks and it sucks
(AZ) 

I just got hired at this local coffee shop, i had my first day yesterday of a 6.5 hour shift. I did great on the job, everything came really easy. But there were a couple red flags before I started that sort of make sense now.


I got a call the day after i applied online. He asked a few questions about scheduling and all, then mentioned there's a high turnover rate. Red flag #1


On Monday I got an interview, the girl was young and very chill. She asked maybe 3 questions , forgot my name and what experience I had on my resume. Then said "well i like you, when can you start?" I'm desperate for money right now, so i said asap.


 Then we went into the shop and she was telling me about it all. Then she mentioned that two people just started and left suddenly for no reason. Red flag #2

Now during my shift, I asked about breaks, she ignored that part and answered another part of my question. The other 2 people working with me didn't get a break, nor was the word even said. My feet hurt so bad after standing for over 6 and a half hours, on top of Walking to and from the shop.


Now i know in arizona, there are no laws regulating breaks, employers don't have to give on. But do you think this is some kind of sign about the company itself?
