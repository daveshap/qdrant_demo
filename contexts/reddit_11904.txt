I just need to rant a bit.
I will warn you that the following text will not be the best grammaticality so please bear with me I'll do the best I can.

 You know what's really bothering me? The fact that this ISIS group or whatever has killed that journalist. Its making so unreasonably angry because of the fact that they did it and because that we (America) can't do shit about it. I mean what is really stopping us from going over there and completely and totally wiping the radical elements off the face of the planet forever? Like who in the world would be mad? No one at all. We would be doing the world a favor by cleaning that hell hole of a country cause the civilians don't want them there. Also it makes me angry that they are beheading people for not following their beliefs. Seriously what the actual fuck we are not in the crusades anymore. I seriously think that we should go there wipe them out and be done with it. I'm tired of the fact that these people can get away with genocide and the rest of the fucking world just twiddles their god damn thumbs. /rant.
