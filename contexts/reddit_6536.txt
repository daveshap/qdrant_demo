Chances of a permanent position within World Bank?
Don't know if this sub is qualified to answer this question, but there seems to be a few 

I'm wondering about. I've read the position descriptions, policies and reviews. Apparently permanent positions are considered on a discretionary basis? 

Does anyone have any insights into how you get a "permanent" position at the World Bank? Does everyone start temporary, and then get offered a permanent gig on a discretionary basis? Do you need to be an exceptional performer? Indispensable to the org? Politics? (both "small-p" office politics, and "big-p" national politics?)

This is almost a theoretical consideration. If i did pursue this, it would be in around 5-10 years time, I would be applying as an Energy Specialist, since i'm adamant that it's where i want to focus my career.

I'm currently an energy economist at a central government agency (not US), working on some high-profile policy, governance, economic and finance issues. I'm well educated, a Law degree and Engineering degree, and honours year in Electricity Market Economics. I will most likely add a Masters in Economics to that soon.
