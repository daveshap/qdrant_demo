Started new job one month ago - scared of getting fired
So i started a new job one month ago. I am 28 and studied engineering. To give some background since graduating in 2015 i worked at one company for 4 years. Then laat october i switched to a new company and i hated my new role so i quit without nothing lined up. I quit after 3 months in january.

Recently got hired at another comoany and its been one month already. Its a manager position although i do not have any direct reports. However, you need a lot of communication and presebtation skills which i dont have. I had social anxiety my whole life and i stutter a bit when i get nervous or when i dont know what i am talking about.

Anyhow, i feel my coworkers think i am stupid for my poor communication skills and i also do not understand very well what i need to do. And i dont know who to ask for help. My boss is always very ambigous.

this new job is huge challenge for me and really scared i will not pass probation. I am already falling behind and my communication skills are really hindering me. When people explain things to me i am really slow to understand and process them so its almost like a waste of time. Same with talking, it takes me a while to figure out what to say and what to ask sk theres a ton of awkward silences in some meetings


Any advice?
