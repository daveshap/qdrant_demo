D'AGOSTA: I'm telling you, something's wrong. I still haven't heard from Pendergast. I think you should call it off.
CUTHBERT: It's too late now. Guests are arriving. The Mayor's car is pulling up.
D'AGOSTA: I'll go down and speak to him.
CUTHBERT: You haven't got the authority. Only Pendergast can pull the plug.
D'AGOSTA: Pendergast may be in trouble. Don't you understand? He still hasn't come back. It's been over three hours --
CUTHBERT: He'll be back. Relax. We're in good shape. Your security is air tight. There've been no more incidents, nothing suspicious. There's no reason to call off the opening now.
KAWAKITA: What kind of egg is it?
MARGO: It's reptilian.
FROCK: Like the claw.
MARGO: Let's not jump to conclusions. This egg could belong to any number of reptiles, Dr. Frock.
FROCK: Come on, Margo. We're on the verge of something huge. Let's consider the possibility, just the three of us, alone in this room. What if John was right. I mean, what if? And he sent back an egg of his monster in the crates. When it got to the museum, it hatched.
MARGO: Several problems with that theory. For one thing, this egg is intact. For another, according to Pendergast, the crates were shipped here on a boat. Everyone on board was killed like Beauregard. If the thing hatched in mid-ocean, where did it go?
