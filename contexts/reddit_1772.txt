I wrote 1,655 words about my college application process to help current juniors (and younger people) with theirs. You should read it but you'll probably skim it and maybe upvote it because you respect how much time I put into it. Oh well
Hey /r/A2C,

I graduate in about week and haven’t been spending much time on here lately because my college apps process is done. I’ve been meaning to write something like this for a while but just never got around to it because I kept putting it off. I’m going to list off some tips that helped me during the process.

To start, I’ll give some background. I’m going to be a CS major next year at a pretty good CS school (PM me for more info because I'm not trying to give away a lot of personal info, but I would say it's one of the most popular schools on here. It's not an Ivy, but it's near the top for CS).

Research now what you need to do. I found out last September I needed two recs and SAT subject tests for some schools. Make sure you find that stuff out now so you aren’t in trouble next fall.

I think essays are a big source of anxiety over the summer before senior year and your first semester of senior year. It might sound crazy, but my honest advice is to not take them so seriously. Like, yeah, they matter, but you can literally write about almost anything. **You don’t have to write about some life-changing event.** All that matters is that it says something about you. Looking back, I spent way too long thinking about what to write about, but it became clear after the process that I didn’t need to dedicate so much time and energy to picking a topic. Have fun writing your essays. It sounds wild, I know, and I actually enjoy writing when I get to write about a topic I’m passionate about, but just chill out and write about whatever the hell you want. It’s supposed to be a view into your personality, not your best rendition of Joey's letter for Chandler and Monica. I’m the kind of person that doesn’t take things too seriously, but I know not everyone is like that, so this advice might not work for everyone. But I’m just giving my $0.02 on this whole process, so that’s what worked for me. I remember everyone freaking out about essays and what to write about last year, and, sure, I was stressed, but I just didn’t think of it as that big of a deal. Be yourself, that’s it. Some of this is on the schools too. It’s really freaking hard to write about why you want to go to a school. I’ve seen people say, “If you can’t write 300-500 words on why you want to go to a school, you shouldn’t apply there.” Maybe it’s just me, but I struggled to reach the word minimum even for my top schools. Shoutout to schools like UChicago and Georgia Tech and other schools like that for actually giving us a chance to showcase our personality. For the Why X schools, I kind of just BS’ed them. Just wrote I thought they wanted to hear and left it at that. It was in the Common App essay and other more personal essays that I took my earlier advice about just having fun writing and not taking myself to seriously.

Second, there’s a *lot* of great info on this subreddit. That said, there is a *lot* of misinformation too. Again, I don’t want to get into this too much because I’m trying to keep it private here because people from my school go on this subreddit, but I know way too much about my top three schools because I researched them hardcore, and I have seen a lot of wrong things on here about them. Still, in general, this subreddit is hugely helpful, especially for someone who didn’t have much help from parents throughout this process.

Keep an open mind. The school I’m going to next year wasn’t even on my mind in August of last year. My counselor gave me a list of schools he thought I should apply to, and I went back and forth on even keeping it on my list. Come December-January, it was my top school.

Don’t ED unless you’re 100% totally sure you want to go there. My top school in October didn’t have ED but I probably would have ED’d there if they did. I’m glad I didn’t.

Start essays early. I say it, everyone says it, and I know you probably won’t. For me, it’s not that I was so super stressed in late October, but instead it was looking back later and knowing I could have done better if I started earlier. That probably didn’t make sense. Let me rephrase: I started most of my essays about a week before they were due (I know, I’m literally the worst). I finished in plenty of time because I didn’t go crazy trying to think of ideas and nitpick every single thing. But I looked back at my essays in March (after I had gotten my decisions - *never* look at your essays after you apply until you get your decisions because you will drive yourself nuts finding tiny mistakes) and realized that I had gained so much knowledge of the college apps process since applying and I would have done a much better job if I started research earlier. Do that. It helps. I know you probably won’t, but you can’t say I didn’t warn you when you look back at your essays next year and kick yourself for how much they suck.

Finally, don’t be a dick. Don’t brag to others about where you got in and didn’t. I made a point to be vocal with where I got rejected because I think it’s important that people know it’s not the end of the world. Ask “Do you know where you’re going yet?” instead of “Where are you going next year?” because some people don’t get in anywhere they applied. Don’t look down on others because you never know what they’re going through (money concerns especially. College is expensive). I heard someone say, “Oh, I thought you’d go somewhere better” to one of their friends. They probably just didn’t think before they said that and meant it as a complement of their intelligence, but, I mean, come on, don’t say that. People say it’s a crapshoot, and that applies when you get in as well as when you’re rejected. Be humble when you get in places because a lot of people didn’t, and brush it off as best you can when you don’t in places because there’s another place out there for you. I’m not a big believer in the whole dream school idea because I honestly think a lot of schools can give you pretty much the same experience. We sometimes fetishize certain schools in our heads even though you’ll probably have a relatively similar experience at most of the schools you apply to. At least for me. I know some people are just applying to the top X schools for their major. Miss me with that. I would despise life at Carnegie Mellon even if they’re really good at CS. I’m just different than that socially. Not trying to hate myself for the next four years, you know? Editing to add this last part in now because this sounds like I’m just roasting CMU. I’m not. I just mean it’s not right for me personally. It’s perfect for a lot of other people. I just think I wouldn’t like it there.

Before I go, I want to echo what I talked about in my first paragraph about not taking this process too seriously. That’s not to say it’s not a big deal - it is - but don’t base your self-worth around where you’re going to college. My parents were pretty hands-off throughout it all so I didn’t have that much pressure, but I know some people’s parents aren’t like that. Sit back and think every once in a while, like, whoa, I get to pick where I study. I get to pick what I study. In X months, I’ll have independence and be living on my own in a place I earned the right to be at. That’s pretty fucking cool. Make this thing fun. You only get to/have to do it once. Stop putting so much pressure on yourself to get accepted to all of these colleges. If you had told me this a year ago, I would have sent you to /r/wowthanksimcured because I know you can’t “just stop” putting so much pressure on yourself, or at least most of you can’t. Just, please, try to have some fun with this. College isn’t the end, it’s the beginning (and now I’m a philosopher I guess). This is the start of your new world of independence, but thankfully you’re eased in with the help of parents and teachers and counselors. Enjoy it. Sit back and smile and think about how you’re picking your own path.

That’s it. Definitely not proofreading this so my bad for any typos. Again, PM me for any personal/CS-specific/school-specific questions. These are just my $0.02 so YMMV. This process is different for everyone, this is just what helped me.

One more thing, about ECs, I literally had 0 CS-related ECs. 0 math competitions. 0 science competitions. No DECA or Science Olympiad. Nothing like that. I had a couple years of varsity sports, community service, and some clubs I’m interested in. Do stuff you like. Not stuff you think colleges will like. I’m not going to lie and say it wouldn’t have helped me if I had USACO Gold (I honestly don’t know what that is but I’ve seen it on here as a good thing), but I don’t think the cost of trying to get that (and probably failing) is worth what I would have given up. Do shit you like.
