Proper installation procedure for external Kubuntu install and rEFInd Given:A laptop (albeit a tablet in a laptop chasis) with an eMMC as an internal storage;Contains an existing Windows 10 installation (out of the box),A live Kubuntu USB stick and;A USB flash driveHow do you properly install:rEFInd (see below for more details)Kubuntu unto the USB flash driveProvided that the desired outcome and rEFInd behavior would be that:rEFInd automatically presents an OS (Operating System) as an option if and only if that OS is bootable / present, i.e. the USB flash drive where Kubuntu is installed is plugged inI have attempted to do the installation twice, and twice did rEFInd present an Ubuntu option both when the USB flash drive with Kubuntu installation is plugged and when it is not (presents screen with \"grub>\" when option selected with USB flash drive unplugged);First install, /dev/sdb (the USB flash drive, as sda is the live USB) was selected as the boot loader installation deviceSecond install /dev/sdb5 (the USB flash drive's EFI System Partition) was selected as the boot loader installation deviceHoping for some answers. Thank you.
