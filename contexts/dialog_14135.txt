BOY: We ain't ate nothin' since yestidday.
PETER: What happened to your money?
BOY: Ma spent it all for the tickets. She didn't know it was gonna be so much. We shouldn'a come, I guess, but Ma said there's a job waitin' for her in New Yorkâ€”and if we didn't go, she might lose it.
PETER: Going without food is bad business, son. Why didn't you ask somebody?
BOY: I was gonna do it, but Ma wouldn't let me. She was ashamed, I guess.
