Almost told him I love him and them he reminded me I'm just "kink community"
Isolation has been really, really hard. I've been seeing a guy since November and at first it was meant to be casual but I have been upfront an honest since I started feeling more. We discussed it and, I dunno, maybe I misunderstood him but he sounded like he decided he wanted more out of the relationship too. But since we haven't been able to see each other for awhile it feels very much like he's over it. And I was trying to explain how out of it I feel because he hasn't been talking to me much and he said something along the lines of "yeah it's been hard to keep up with kink community right now." And i...  I dunno. I guess I thought I was more than that. But maybe not. Maybe I'll always only be a sexual object to people. Maybe I not worthy of being loved. Maybe my brain telling me I'm worthless and unlovable and a waste of space is right. I've spent so many years trying to convince myself that's not true but time and time again people treat me otherwise. And I'm so tired of being alone and not being loved. I don't wanna do this anymore. I'm so tired of being a burden.
