Fn keys for volume and brightness don't work on Lenovo Thinkpad e460 running Ubuntu 18.04 On my Lenovo Thinkpad e460, Fn keys don\u00b4t work.I tried to enable/disable in the BIOS but it didn't help. When I was using fedora with GNOME 3 on this device it worked perfectly. I don't know how to adjust volume or display brightness without the Fn keys. What could be the problem and how can I fix it?
