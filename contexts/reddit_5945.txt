Looking for new career opportunities
So I'm moving to Chicago to be with my fiance by the end of the year on the k1-visa. Which means I won't be able to work for about 9 months (give or take)

  


I'm Gunna have to start fresh and look for work, which gives me serious anxiety.

  


I only have my GED, but I'm looking into taking a course that could lead me to a lucrative career and prove stable.

  


Does anyone have some suggestions.
