Dealing With Isolation From Being Out of Work and Sabotaging My Interviews?
Long story short, I'm a recent grad who worked in their job for 2 years before there was a reorganization and I was fired.  

I've been out of work for a **year** now and as a result have had to move in with my parents. Home situation is kinda toxic and there's not much communication. As a result, I've forced myself to get out even just to hit up the local coffee shop and clear my mind and "be out in society". I've tried to start attending some meetups and make some friends in this new city but I feel like I've started experiencing anxiety and even panic attacks sometime when I think of not being able to find a job...and with all the recruiters ghosting and lousy phone interviews...I feel lucky to have 2 friends right now but its **extremely** **lonely**. 

I **don't** want this to be a barrier. I'm willing to get out and work on myself. I've always been a social butterfly and make friends easily but now I'm finding it hard. Sometimes I'll be practicing for interviews and I feel like there's so much noise in my brain that I'll go insane and if only I could just talk to someone. *I'm worried that because I've been so isolated during interviews I won't be able to clearly articulate myself or come off rehearsed in my interviews. I've been practicing for interviews and my problem is that I feel like I'm not able to articulate myself well* if I don't communicate with anyone for a long time. It's the same effect on someone who comes out of solitary confinement. 

 I don't want to become so socially isolated and allow this to become a barrier to entry again into the workplace. I haven't had a setback this large and I'm really trying to stay positive but how can I find a way to go about this. **Has anyone been in similar situations or have any suggestions on how to go about tackling this issue?**

On a side note,  Q1 is apparently really good for landing new jobs? I wouldn't know.
