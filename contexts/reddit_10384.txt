I plan my suicide 1-3 times per day
if I get an urge to end my life while I'm at work, out running errands, with friends, etc., I usually zone out without realizing and think through exactly how I can kill myself after I leave that function. e.g. "I can go to this store for a rope but they close at 9, so I'll have to leave early, then I can go here, so on and so forth". 

Does anyone else have this issue ? I'll usually zone out for 30 seconds or so and people are wondering why I look all spaced out
