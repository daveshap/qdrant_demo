RIZZO: Jason? He's on this ship?!
YLLO: Of course he is. He's the most relevant find in 400 years...except for you, of course. Look if you're worried about PR don't be. You're walking and talking. He's a stiff. You'll get the publicity.
RIZZO: Are you finished?
YLLO: God damnit! Will you stop doing that?!
DELONGPRE: Oh I like her a lot.
BRODSKI: I'm with you kid.
RIZZO: Where is he?
BRODSKI: Lab two, relax. What's the matter? He's dead.
RIZZO: No, you're dead! You're all dead!
YLLO: Jesus!
JANESSA: Oh my God! Adrienne?
THORGAN: What have you done?
RIZZO: What have I done?! Idiots.
BOEMAN: Brodski! Get to Lab two. We have an emergency!
DELONGPRE: Er, guys. Where's the Hockey Player?
RIZZO: I'll tell you where he is. He's walking around this ship, killing anything that moves.
JANESSA: Maybe she tripped.
BRODSKI: Jesus, God!
KICKER: Oh man, what the hell happened?
RIZZO: Jason! Can't you see? He did this.
YLLO: Impossible! He was dead before he entered Cryo-statis. There is no possible way he could be alive.
RIZZO: I didn't say he was alive.
DALLAS: That's nine to four, geek-boy.
AZRAEL: You got lucky.
DALLAS: You got lucky. I could have waited until he ate your head.
AZRAEL: Speaking of which, duck!
