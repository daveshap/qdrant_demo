How do I get over being fired, even when it’s been a year or two?
I don’t understand why I am still really bitter and angry about this. I was fired from a job about 2 years ago and I don’t fault them, I was getting increasingly ill and my work became sloppy as a result. But I am still bitter about it, I feel stupid that I feel angry but I just can’t forget how insincere the goodbye was. I still feel the rejection of it. I want to get over this but the feelings won’t go away. 

This makes no sense since I got another job soon after and did really well at it, and just recently left it because I have to return to school. But my performance was very good and experience good, and I left on my own terms. 

So even with this success I still feel bitter as hell about being fired issue that’s from two years ago. Any tips on how to get over it. I feel stupid but still so angry about it
