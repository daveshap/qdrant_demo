CURATOR: When Ramesses destroyed Syria, it was an accident. You are a catastrophe! Why do I put up with you?
EVELYN: You put up with me, because I can read and write ancient Egyptian, decipher hieroglyphs and hieratic, and I'm the only person within a thousand miles who knows how to properly code and catalogue this library.
CURATOR: Who needs smart women? I put up with you because your mother and father were our finest patrons, Allah rest their souls. Now straighten up this mess!
