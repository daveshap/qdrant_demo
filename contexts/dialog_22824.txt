DANNY: Jimmy?
GARCETTI: Who the hell is Jimmy?
DANNY: He's the only one I told.
GARCETTI: And he probably only told two people and they probably only told four people and on and one. You know better than to tell a secret to a tweaker, Flynne. Might just as well broadcast it on the evening news.
DANNY: I met the guy at a party. He said he wanted to do a biggie. He's new in town so I offered my services.
TANNER: This chink have a name?
DANNY: Bubba.
TANNER: You better not be blowing smoke up My ass, Flynne.
DANNY: After that ass-whipping you gave me?
GARCETTI: What's on the other end of this thing?
DANNY: Now that I can help you with. Nasty boy ... goes by the name of Pooh-Bear. He's a chef. Check with Palmdale P.D. I'm sure they're keeping box scores on the guy.
GARCETTI: Sounds like you hooked up with some fine citizens, Flynne.
DANNY: Oh they're all that and the proverbial bag of chips.
TANNER: What're your taking down?
DANNY: Standard vig. Minus five for a certain blabber-mouth moron by the name of Jimmy the Finn, who's living proof that natural selection is a flawed theory.
TANNER: Did you really think you were slick enough to pull this off?
DANNY: Look man, I just wanted to make some dough and disappear. I didn't want to wait around for Domingo to figure out who doubled back on him.
