Help with Choosing a GAship
Hello, r/StudentAffairs!

I'm interviewing for GAships at the moment, and I'm wondering what guidelines you used to help you choose which GAship to accept. I'm interviewing both on and off campus, and I want to make sure I make the right choice when choosing a place to work. What were some 'must-haves' for you? How did you choose which area of student affairs to work in?

Thanks!
