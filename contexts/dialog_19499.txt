WALT: What can we do, Mother?
ICEY SPOON: I thought if you went and talked to him -- another man --
WALT: Mister Powell?
PREACHER: A strange woman is a narrow pit!
ICEY SPOON: Amen! Amen!
PREACHER: She lieth in wait as for a prey. And increaseth the transgressors among men.
PREACHER: My dear, dear friends! Whatever would I do without you!
ICEY SPOON: Mister Powell!
WALT: Is there anythin' -- anythin'...?
PREACHER: It is my shame -- my crown of thorns. And I must wear it bravely.
ICEY SPOON: What could have possessed that girl!
PREACHER: Satan.
ICEY SPOON: Ah.
WALT: Didn't you have no inkling?
PREACHER: Yes; from the first night.
WALT: The first night?
PREACHER: Our honeymoon.
WALT: How's that?
PREACHER: She turned me out of the bed.
