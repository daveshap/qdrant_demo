ZUKOVSKY: What are doing, Bond? Trying to impress this innocent thing?
BOND: She’s no innocent. This is my nuclear consultant.
ZUKOVSKY: Ah, I see. A purely...plutonic relationship.
ZUKOVSKY: Really Bond, couldn’t you find a nice Russian scientist with hair growing out of his ears?
BOND: What’s your business with Elektra King?
ZUKOVSKY: I thought you were the one in her business.
BOND: She dropped a million and half dollars to the House -- your House. And you didn’t even bat an eyelid. She was paying you off. What for?
ZUKOVSKY: As ever you are the spy who has to see a plot wherever he looks.
ZUKOVSKY: That is 5,000 dollars of Beluga ruined!
BOND: You are out of your league. She’s working with Renard.
