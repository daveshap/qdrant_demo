I hate living in this world. Everything is about money and I’m sick of it.
I don’t want to sound ungrateful or like I’m complaining. But I’m really fed up with living in this world everything is so expensive I’m so miserable. I feel like for the rest of my life I’ll be slaving for some green paper till I’m dead and gone. I’m tired of paying bills and I’m tired of living here. People keep saying that this is a free country and you can achieve anything that you want to. But how can you when everything is so hard. Nothing is free here everything has a price tag. Everything is not easy they make life a living hell. I feel so trapped I’m tired of it I want out. The crazy thing is we cannot take none of this with us so why is it so much pressure and stress on us to make money. I understand this is the way the world was formed but it’s honestly draining.
