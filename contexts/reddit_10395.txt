Does anyone else just wish someone would come up behind them and just shoot them in the head?
I want to die so beyond badly, but I dont have the courage to do it myself. I'm afraid of failing, becoming brain dead, becoming paralyzed, getting committed and losing my job, my boyfriend... I just wish someone would do it quick for me this way I wouldn't be scared or nervous about it. Itd just finally be over. I'm such a coward...
