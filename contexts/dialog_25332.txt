ARTIM: Chase me!
DATA: For what purpose?
ARTIM: Because you're it. And if you tag me... then I'm it.
DATA: But I can run much faster than you... I am capable of exceeding forty-seven meters per second...
ARTIM: Data... haven't you ever just played... for fun?
DATA: Androids... don't have...fun.
ARTIM: Why not...?
DATA: No one's ever asked me that before.
ARTIM: If you want to know 'what it's like to be a child', you need to learn how to play...
PICARD: You need a haircut, Commander.
WORF: Accelerated hair growth is often experienced by Klingons during Jak'tahla...
ANIJ: Jak'tahla?
PICARD: Roughly translated: puberty... although for a Klingon that's not doing it justice... Any severe mood swings, unusual aggressive tendencies -- be sure to let me know right away...
WORF: The Ba'ku could use some rest, sir. According to the geo-scan, this may be the safest area for the next few kilometers...
PICARD: Very well. We'll take an hour. Break out some rations...
ANIJ: Right beyond that ridge is where the caves begin... we can hide for days...
PICARD: By now the Son'a have scanned the area and know that just as well as we do.
