COLLEEN: Ford Fairlane, I'm Colleen Sutton and I need your help. I have a problem and it pertains to the music industry. What is it they call you? Mr. Rock and...
FORD: Don't say it. Orange juice?
COLLEEN: Please.
FORD: Sorry about the glass. And the house. And the breath.
COLLEEN: Mr. Fairlane, I'm very rich. The kind of rich that warps minds. Nothing offends me. When I was eleven, I walked in on my father and the Shetland pony he had given me for my tenth birthday. Does that excite you?
FORD: I don't know, I never met your father.
FORD: Oh, that! Don't take it personally. He always wakes up before I do. Down boy! Roseanne Barr naked!
COLLEEN: Who's your decorator?
FORD: Some fag. Charged me up the ass.
COLLEEN: Fag? Ass? I'm sorry, is that a joke?
FORD: Poor taste. I know. Listen, I respect homosexuals. When I was young, my maid was a homosexual. My maid was a homosexual.
COLLEEN: I don't have a sense of humor, either. Sorry.
FORD: Now that we've broken the ice...
COLLEEN: I need you to find my little sister. She goes by the name Zuzu...
FORD: Zuzu Petals. You want me to rescue her from the gorgeous hell that is L.A.
COLLEEN: But how did you know? Here, take this picture...
FORD: No thanks. I carry my own.
COLLEEN: Excuse me?
FORD: Let's see, you're her worried sister. Yesterday I met her worried father who incidentally was about five years younger than you. In fact, I capped off the evening by watching him get electrocuted. They talk about cases like this in the private eye handbook... something about a ten-foot pole.
COLLEEN: Five thousand should be enough to assuage any qualms you have about my family tree.
FORD: Yeah, but of course for now, I only get a twenty.
COLLEEN: Actually, you may take it all now.
FORD: Oh... I have some questions.
COLLEEN: I have no answers. Thanks for the stain. Find the girl. In the envelope are tickets to the Dorothy Chandler. We'll chat again, then.
FORD: Ah, the Dorothy Chandler. I was just there with my good friend Art Mooney the other night...
COLLEEN: Who?
FORD: Nuthin'.
