Have countries that enacted public health policies in reaction to new outbreaks that focus on economic development fared better than countries that take a science-driven approach?
**The stark differences in the response of China to the original SARS outbreak and the response of South Korea to the current outbreak make a good starting point for discussion...** 


> [In November 2002, a form of atypical pneumonia called severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) began spreading rapidly around the world, prompting the World Health Organization (WHO) to declare the ailment “a worldwide health threat.” At the epicenter of the outbreak was China, where the outbreak of SARS infected more than 5,300 people and killed 349 nationwide](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK92479/). 

[The Chinese government was slow to respond, in part to avoid making the administration look bad, and prop up the economy](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK92479/):

> Evidence also indicates that the provincial government, in deciding whether to publicize the event, considered not only the public health implications of the outbreak, but also the effect such information might have on local economic development  

> ...

> To publicly acknowledge the outbreak at this critical juncture might have risked not only causing socioeconomic instability but sullying the party’s image among the people.

Ultimately, [a fatal period of hesitation regarding information-sharing and action spawned anxiety, panic, and rumor-mongering across the country and undermined the government’s efforts to create a milder image of itself in the international arena.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK92479/)

&nbsp;

In contrast, the South Korean government has taken a [much more aggressive and science-driven approach](https://fortune.com/2020/03/03/coronavirus-us-test/) to the current outbreak,

> South Korean officials are setting up "drive-thru" coronavirus screening facilities. Manufacturers in China have the capacity to distribute more than 1.5 million tests a week. The countries, alongside Italy and the U.K., are testing tens of thousands of people for the coronavirus, in many cases processing thousands of samples a day. 

while simultaneously being [much more open with the public](https://www.pri.org/stories/2020-03-03/south-korea-s-approach-containing-coronavirus-model-rest-world),

> in stark contrast to China’s hard-handed tactics, such as locking down entire cities and tightly controlling the dissemination of information about the disease, Korea has adopted a gentler policy of voluntary containment and keeping citizens updated on its efforts in near real-time.

which has been [well received](https://www.pri.org/stories/2020-03-03/south-korea-s-approach-containing-coronavirus-model-rest-world),

> “The reason why we are receiving so many messages about the rising number of infections is because the government is quickly carrying out tests for the virus,” he said. “I’m happy with the way the authorities are handling the outbreak.”

* **What policies might the US government enact to minimize harmful rumors, disinformation, and misinformation about the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak?**
