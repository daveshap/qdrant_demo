What to Expect When Going Through the Technical Interview
Iâ€™ve just published the second post of my series called "Interviewing for an IT job". 

My goal is to share personal experiences regarding technical interviews and help others by giving tips and relevant information that may help them go through a typical IT job interview.

Check it out: http://www.technoideas.com/the-technical-interview/

Let me know if I can help you.

Cheers.
