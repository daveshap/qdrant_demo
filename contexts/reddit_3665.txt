Ghosters, get your shit together
In the past year I have sent a few “hey I had a nice time but...” messages. THAT IS HOW SIMPLE IT IS. I have gotten a thanks for being honest message every single time. If someone reacts negatively to your honesty after one date and starts negotiating then by all means block and delete. But at least let them know you aren’t interested instead of just not replying.
