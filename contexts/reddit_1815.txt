this sub in a nutshell
* **"unpopular opinion:"**

   * High Test score, High GPA:
      *  " try hard"
      *  "no social life"

      * "go to community college"
      * "go through \[an extremely competitive, cut-throat\] transfer process"
   * Sub-Par test score, high GPA:

      * "easy classes"
      * "probably live in a potato farm in Idaho" (inflation)
      * "no social life"
   * High test score, low GPA
      * "payed >1k for prep books and classes"
      * "no social life"
* "This sub is toxic" -- posts that provide great observations, but add to the somewhat pessimistic tone in the subreddit
* "y'all need to get a social life"

The biggest concern I have for the sub is the fact people seem to be evaluating others' social lives based on their GPA and SAT/ACT score. In real life, would you really quantify someone's people skills based on academic numbers? Would you say out loud: "Wow, a 4.0 GPA? Do you ever get out of the house?" 

Second, there seems to be a huge dispute between GPA or SAT/ACT score. I too, am biased when it comes to disputing whether test scores or GPA is a better measure of academic potential (stronger GPA than test scores). Yet, they're both going to be evaluated, and people shouldn't be discredited for having a strong GPA or strong test score.

I really hope this didn't hurt/offend anyone. I'm truly grateful this subreddit exists and have gotten great advice from you guys.
