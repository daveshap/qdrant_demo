Getting out of the long term unemployment trap.
I'm honestly near the end of my rope here.  


I'm hoping someone here will be able to get me squared away so I can get back on my feet and moving forward in life again.  


My situation. I'm a 90% service connected disabled, medically retired Veteran and I have been unemployed now for almost four years. I've been applying for work starting when I received notification that I was going to be medically retired almost four years ago knowing I'd need a job, gone to school to renew industry certifications and keep my skills current but I'm getting absolutely nowhere.   


I have solid references, enough IT certifications to wallpaper a house, extensive experience and training. 

I've had my resume professionally reviewed, gotten on Indeed, LinkedIn, USAJOBs, the State unemployment office and applied for any position posting that was even tangentially related to my past work history and experience.  Thus far out of hundreds of applications I've had only 3 responses with 1 interview and that did not result in a callback.   


Am I missing something or approaching the situation the wrong way?
