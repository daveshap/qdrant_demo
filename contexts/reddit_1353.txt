Does anyone else fear that people you interact with might think you're insane because of how weird anxiety makes you act?
Sometimes I'm totally fine and can hangout with complete strangers and have a great time and all is well but other times (probably the majority of the time) I'm a nervous wreck and my voice cracks or gets way lower than usual and I mumble and can't look people in the eyes and (apparently, from what I've been told) have a super pissed off look on my face for no reason when I'm interacting with people I don't know and I'm starting to get scared that a lot of people think I'm some kind of psycho from how weird I may seem when my anxiety's flaring up.

I also start over analyzing the way I walk so I walk super weird and sometimes have intrusive thoughts of super embarrassing moments that make me visibly cringe.... Jesus, even as I'm typing this I'm realizing I probably look even worse than I thought.... Anyone else fear that those around them think they're some kind of psycho when they're actually just super nervous for no reason?
