Should I take tech recruiters seriously who are unprofessional and speak broken English?
I am recently laid off so I have begun my job search as an Android mobile developer. After submitting my profile to a few job board I am receiving many calls and emails every day from recruiters who all seem the same:

* They have very heavy Indian accents, which makes it very hard to understand over the phone.
* Even after sending over my resume, they expect me to fill out a bunch of information that has already been provided to them in my resume (a few have even asked for the last 4 of my social security number).
* After calling some will them text me (a recruiter yesterday texted me in Hindi and English after a call)

Should I start not taking these recruiters seriously? I have never had one of these types of recruiters help me even land an interview.

Should I stop wasting my time with these types of recruiters?
