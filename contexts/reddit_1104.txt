Does anyone else find it a little surreal that people just go about their lives?
I don't know if I'm alone with this thought, but the idea that my friends can just go out is mad. Like people just get up and do. Daily stuff like catching a bus, going to the supermarket, going to lessons, all things I'd have to do with at least some level of panic involved. And people just get on with it.

Back when I was still able to go out, there were hours before hand of making sure I've eaten properly, washed thuroughly, at least 30 minute lie-down to calm. And then there's my housemate who just hops out at a moments notice.

It just seems... strange  


P.S. I was not expecting this many people to see this, I can't really imagine 900 indeviduals. There was 600 at my secondary school, that's mad. Thank you everyone for sharing your stories and perspectives. It's been a really plesant to read them all <3
