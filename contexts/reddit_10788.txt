Why can't there be an easy and peaceful way to die?
I've wanted to kill myself for a while now, but I'm afraid of suffering or being in a panicked situation even if it's only for the brief moment. Why are the only options inhumane methods? It's so stupid that society is against assisted suicide, especially because what's the harm with it? Some might say it's unethical, well it's also unethical to force someone to kill themselves inhumanely... I hate this.
