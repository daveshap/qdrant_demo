TOM: Yes. You didn't have to come here. It's just that I'm going to anchor this special report on this Libyan thing...
BUDDY: Anchor?
TOM: Yes, stop! I wondered if you could find out anything about what's happening. What's wrong?

TOM: No. I'm doing fine...Look.
BUDDY: Good. He's on the world's longest ego trip, let him take it alone.
TOM: Hey, okay. Look Buddy -- I've got to go to work.
BUDDY: ...good-bye then.
TOM: I'll speak to you.
BUDDY: Well, who knows. Just let m tell you what my favorite teacher ever, told me -- 'Don't be afraid to be wonderful.'
