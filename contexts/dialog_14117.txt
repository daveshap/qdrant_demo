SHAPELEY: But I don't go in for that kinda stuff—much. I like to pick my fillies. Take you, for instance. You're my type. No kiddin' sister. I could go for you in a big way. Fun-on-the-side Shapeley" they call me
ELLIE: Believe you me, you bore me to distraction.
SHAPELEY: Well, you're two up on me now.
PETER: Hey, you!
SHAPELEY: Huh?
PETER: There's a seat over there for you.
SHAPELEY: What's the idea?
PETER: I'd like to sit with my—uh—wife—if you don't mind.
SHAPELEY: Wife?
PETER: Yeah. Come on—come on!
SHAPELEY: Oh, excuse me. I was just tryin'—you know—to make things pleasant.
ELLIE: If you promise not to snap my head off, I'd like to thank you.
PETER: Forget it. I didn't do it for you. His voice got on my nerves.
