Residence Advisor/Don/Staff Syllabi?
Hi Everyone,

I am doing some research on Residence Staff courses, and I'm looking for some syllabi or course outlines from other universities/colleges. It's proving to be a bit more difficult than I thought it would be. I was wondering if anyone knows of any institutions that have a course for their Residence Staff (Advisors/Dons), and would be able to point me in that direction? Preferably from North America, but at this point I'll take anything.

Thanks in advance!
