TALL KNIGHT: When you have found the shrubbery, place the shrubbery here, beside this shrubbery ... only slightly higher, so you get a two-level effect with a path through the middle.
OTHER KNIGHTS: A path! A little path for the late Knights of Ni!
TALL KNIGHT: When you have found the shrubbery, then you must cut down the mightiest tree in the forest ... with a herring.
OTHER KNIGHTS: Yes! With a herring! With a herring! Cut down with a herring!
ARTHUR: We shall do no such thing ... let us pass!
TALL KNIGHT: Oh, please!
ARTHUR: Cut down a tree with a herring? It can't be done!
OTHER KNIGHTS: Oh!
TALL KNIGHT: Don't say that word.
ARTHUR: What word?
TALL KNIGHT: I cannot tell you. Suffice to say is one of the words the Knights of Ni! cannot hear!
ARTHUR: How can we not say the word, if you don't tell us what it is?
TALL KNIGHT: You said it again!
ARTHUR: What, is"?"
TALL KNIGHT: No, no ... not is"!"
