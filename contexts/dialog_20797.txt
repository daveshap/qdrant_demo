BELINDA: When? Approximately what year did this event take place?
ANDREW: I guess it was 1984, 85.
BELINDA: Were you aware in 1984 or 1985 that there was a fatal disease out there, called AIDS, and that you could contract it through sexual activity?
ANDREW: It's impossible to know exactly when or how I was infected with HIV.
BELINDA: But you <u>were</u> having anonymous sex in porno theaters in 1984 and 1985?
ANDREW: That happened once. People weren't talking about AIDS then, the way we are now. Or safe sex.
BELINDA: You'd <u>heard</u> of AIDS in 1984, 85?
ANDREW: I'd heard of <u>something</u>. The gay plague, gay cancer, but... we didn't know how you could get it, or that it could kill you.
BELINDA: Do you need a break?
ANDREW: No.
BELINDA: While you were employed at Wyant Wheeler, you did everything you could to make sure no one knew you were an active homosexual, correct?
ANDREW: That is <u>not</u> correct. I never lied about it.
BELINDA: Did you keep a picture of your lover on your desk?
ANDREW: No.
BELINDA: Do other lawyers at the firm keep pictures of their spouses or fiances on their desks?
ANDREW: Some do. I didn't.
BELINDA: As a homosexual, one is often forced to conceal one's sexuality, is that right?
ANDREW: In some situations.
BELINDA: Isn't it true you have spent your life pretending to be something you're not, so much so that the art of concealment and dishonesty has become second nature to you?!
JOE: Objection!
BELINDA: I'll withdraw it. Mr. Beckett? Were you living with Miguel Alvarez in 1984 or 1985 when you had your anonymous sexual encounter in the porn theater?
ANDREW: Yes.
BELINDA: You could have infected him, isn't that right?
ANDREW: Miguel has not been infected. As I said, we weren't aware of AIDS, then, or how it is spread.
BELINDA: Really?
ANDREW: Yes.
BELINDA: You've testified the lesions on your face were visible to the people you worked with, correct?
ANDREW: That's right.
BELINDA: And it's your contention, that when the partners were made aware of the lesions, they jumped to the conclusion you had AIDS and fired you.
ANDREW: Absolutely.
BELINDA: Do you have any lesions on your face at this time?
ANDREW: One. Here, in front of my ear.
