I’m bi. A trend I’ve seen is that women seem to see me as good end game material (but not yet) but don’t want to hookup with me. Whenever this coronavirus thing is over with I think I’ll just focus on bettering myself and maybe hookup with men from time to time
I’m just tired of being treated like an awesome guy that is totally wanted but when it comes down to it is kinda not. Not yet. I’ll still be friends with several women. We’ll still be cool. But I need to get over looking for a relationship. I’m about to be making a bunch of money and I’m sorry but if that’s how it plays out I’ll feel like I’m being used. I’m not gonna let myself get treated like that. I’m not gonna let that happen
