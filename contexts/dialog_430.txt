DAN: About him?
ALICE: No. Well, not exactly...it's that...I felt like I wasn't in control. For the first time since...all that. I'm scared.
DAN: You stopped it didn't you? It was probably just a regular bad dream.
ALICE: Yeah...I guess.
DAN: You don't dream him up, he can't hurt you. Or me. Or us. Remember...
ALICE: You're right.
DAN: There you go. Love you.
ALICE: Me too.
