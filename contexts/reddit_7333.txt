Employer paid for training, applying for another job
My employer paid for me to take a series of classes between May and this month that led to me getting a few certifications.  They spent about $12k total. 

Since then, a job opportunity popped up.  I've been looking for jobs for years but it's rare that I find something this specific to what I want to do that doesn't require me to move or commute over 3 hours a day, so I applied and now I have an interview scheduled.  It's not a sure thing but I think I have a really good chance to get an offer.  

What are the ethics here?  If these jobs were common I'd probably wait a year for another one to pop up but there's no guarantee that would happen.  I've been with this company for over 10 years.
