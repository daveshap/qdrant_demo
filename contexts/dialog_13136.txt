BLACKBURN: Easy. You've got to keep still for a bit, the last thing we need is a coronary.
EVELYN: You're the Doctor, sweetheart. 'Guess the atropine worked, then.
BLACKBURN: Convinced all those that needed convincing: you're an official dead lady.
EVELYN: And what's Steven's status?
BLACKBURN: Still alive, but it's just a matter of time. And then will come your miraculous resurrection --
EVELYN: -- oh
BLACKBURN: But you didn't
EVELYN: -- the James Dean wannabe with the hair trigger --
BLACKBURN: -- or might turn out to be -- very big surprise -- that Jenzen girl. The little bitch has the right stuff. She nearly put a bullet in Price right after your demise.""
EVELYN: So what stopped her?
BLACKBURN: It's complicated. But don't worry --
EVELYN: -- there's already been way too many complications for a very simple plan. You ever find out what happened to Melissa Marr?
BLACKBURN: Not yet.
EVELYN: So we don't even know if she's alive or dead --
BLACKBURN: -- Price killed her, there's no other explanation --
EVELYN: -- there's plenty: for all we know, Steven's got her spying on us right now --
BLACKBURN: -- bullshit --
EVELYN: -- the whole thing is falling apart!
BLACKBURN: It's not, baby. Just a matter of minutes now, before somebody pulls the trigger --
EVELYN: -- but nobody has yet, Donald. They just haven't been brought to that breaking point. They have to believe proof-positive that their lives are in danger.
BLACKBURN: How much more do they need than your death at his hands?
EVELYN: But they didn't see it happen, they still have doubts. What we need is another body, and Steven's bloody hands right next to it!
BLACKBURN: And how the hell are we going to do that?
EVELYN: Okay: this may sound crazy, but --
EDDIE: This is the best we're gonna do.
SARA: It'll have to do.
SARA: You coming, or are you waiting for Blackburn?
PRITCHETT: Blackburn's dead.
SARA: Excuse me?
PRITCHETT: He would have been back by now.
