*Please* never get a payday loan
This is an embarrassing situation I got myself into. I want to share for anyone considering a payday loan.


My first payday load was $700. When my checks would come in I had other bills I needed to pay first and just paid interest. I paid this loan off finally after 14 weeks. Total of $980 in interest.

After that loan was paid I needed some more cash for bills a few months later. $1,000 payday loan. Again, when my checks came in, other bills had to be paid. Took 20 weeks to pay it off. $2,050 paid in interest.

Total of $3,030 paid in interest for a $1,700 dollar loan.


Just don’t do it. I would have been better off paying every single bill late and just paying a late fee. I felt desperate at the time but getting those loans did not help. I have a lot of shame around money and took these loans so I wouldn’t have to call those I owed and tell them I had to pay late.

 $3,030 down the drain to save myself from a few moments of embarrassment.
