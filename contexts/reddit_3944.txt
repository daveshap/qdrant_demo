How to get out of the “forever alone/single” mindset
I’m a 25 year old straight guy and I can’t get out of the forever alone or forever single mindset. I haven’t really had a girlfriend since high school and even that wasn’t a super long term relationship. 

I’ve got a great career and lots of great friends, but one area of my life I wish was different is my love life. I think part of the reason I don’t really have one is I’ve been focusing on my career and stuff so I kind of put it to the side. 

But now that I’m ready to start looking, I don’t really have any confidence at all. I’m overweight which certainly doesn’t help (I’m looking to improve this as well by losing weight and getting in shape, but that’s a different conversation). I have Tinder/bumble and I do get matches but nothing ever comes out of it (mostly my fault). I’m great at talking to women over text and Snapchat but I never actually make the next step to go on a date or hang out with them even though they always ask “when are we going to hang out?” And all that kind of stuff. I don’t know why I just never go to that next step, maybe because I’m not truly interested in them?

I also have never been the type to go out of my way to talk to strangers. If I’m in a bar with friends, I really just talk to my friends and never have the balls to approach a girl at all. Is this some sort of social anxiety or something, or just shyness? 

I guess I’m just looking for some advice from those of you that have been through this kind of thing because whenever I bring it up to friends, they always just say “you’ll find someone!!”

Edit: just wanted to make it clear that I’m not depressed or anything like that. I’m a very happy person and enjoy almost all aspects of my life, I just want to finally focus on my love life
