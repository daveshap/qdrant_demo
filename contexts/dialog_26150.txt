LT. QUIFFER: Sorry, King. My leg's stiff as a board.
MAJOR KONG: Hey, Terry, I'm hit.
LT. TOEJAM: So am I.
MAJOR KONG: Listen, I think I'm hit bad.
LT. TOEJAM: Where'd they get you?
MAJOR KONG: Damn you, Lieutenant Toejam! Lothar!
LT. ZOGG: Yes, Major.
MAJOR KONG: Lothar, get up here fast, and bring your First- Aid kit! I'm hit kinda bad, I think.
LT. ZOGG: Can't Ace" help you?"
MAJOR KONG: He's dead.
LT. ZOGG: What happened?
MAJOR KONG: I bit his jugular vein. Now will you shut up and get up here???
LT. ZOGG: Sure! Sure, I'm on my way.
LT. ZOGG: Where'd they get you?
MAJOR KONG: In the back...feels like an arrowhead.
LT. ZOGG: How do you know he's dead?
MAJOR KONG: Hell, he looks dead.
LT. ZOGG: He's dead, all right.
MAJOR KONG: Listen, give me a shot quick!
