THEO: Stop the crying.
MALE VOICE: She's yours. What are we waiting on?
THEO: I'm backing up.
LENORE: Rachel was terrified when I left her. I could see it in her eyes.
THEO: She'll be with you soon. They're pulling up. They'll realize I kept my part of the bargain.
LENORE: She'll never be the same. None of us will.
THEO: Include me in that.
THEO: Count it.
MALE VOICE: Don't worry.
THEO: Next I want to see Rachel. Put her on the phone before she gets out so her mother can tell her exactly what to do. Keep her calm. Tell her you're fine and that she can join you in this car.
