MANZANO: My family lives in Miami. Because of the death threats.
CREASY: It's not worth it. Be with them instead.
MANZANO: It galls me to watch you. You can do as much in days as I can in years. Men like the 'The Dreamer' are protected. Out of everyone's grasp it seems, but yours.
CREASY: Are you going to arrest me or talk me to death?
MANZANO: My country needs justice. Proper justice. Gunning men down in the street only feeds the violence. They need to be brought to trial. Dealt with properly. Then people will respect the law. When they see it works.
CREASY: So you are going to talk me to death.
MANZANO: You walk out and deal justice. You're what I wish I could be. The policemen who kills you, his family will have all they want.
CREASY: Then I hope the one who gets me has got lots of kids. What do you want?
MANZANO: I want to arrest you for murder! I want to shake your hand and reload your gun! I want to kill my pride and give you my blessing.
CREASY: My deal is with Rosanna. I knew you guys were up to something. Are you two fucking?
MANZANO: No, but I have to admit I thought about it.
CREASY: Liar. Just tell me who the bank card belongs to. Name and address.
MANZANO: You have no interest in making things easy, do you?
CREASY: I'm not... easy.
