LOKI: How do we know this is the way?
ERIK: We blew the Horn Resounding.
LOKI: SHE blew the Horn Resounding.
KEITEL: Don't you see, Erik! She wants revenge!
ERIK: What are you talking about?
LOKI: Shut up!
KEITEL: She knows it was our fault!
LOKI: Keep your mouth shut, Keitel!
KEITEL: No! It's YOU, Loki! I should never have listened to you!
LOKI: You've lost your mind.
KEITEL: We came to stop you waking the Gods, Erik! But I didn't want anyone to get hurt!
LOKI: You fool!
LOKI: I should have got rid of you long ago!
KEITEL: Like you got rid of Snorri!
AUD: No! No! We are in the spell of the Horn! Hatred will destroy us.
ERIK: That's right!
