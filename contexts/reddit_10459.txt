Enough
I am 40 years old. Another failed relationship, no kids. 10 brothers and sisters only one speaks to me. I was convicted of manslaughter at 16 years old and spent 7 years in prison. Prior to that was raised in system in southern California. Dad was murdered when I was 6 and mom is a junky. I know all the things people want to say, sadly, I'm just tired of chasing a dream. I have seriously  given this a really good shot. The only positive thing I did in my life was quit drinking four years ago. Dont know why I'm posting here. Just interested I guess to see what if anything will come of it. Take care
