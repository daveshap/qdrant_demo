WICHITA: Howdy Pouty.
DONALD: I was pretty confident that I was going to blow it with Talia, but I must say, I outdid myself.
WICHITA: She's still pissed at me and took it out on you. We should have taken it slower. It's hard to operate in the woods. Much easier in, like a club. Tell the girl you've got to go do something, leave her view, take way too long until she is worried that you're not coming back. Just as she starts feeling awful, you come up from behind and touch her neck...
DONALD: You are the prince of the darkness.
