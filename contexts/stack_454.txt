How to get special characters on keyboard input? I am taking a latin class, and I need to be able to type latin on my keyboard. Due to the fact that latin uses all the characters in english, it's been fine so far, but now I've run into a problem.I need the characters \u0101, \u0113, \u012b, \u014d, and \u016b to be easily accessible via the keyboard (e.g. Alt+A to get \u0101, or something of the such).How can I do this in Ubuntu?
