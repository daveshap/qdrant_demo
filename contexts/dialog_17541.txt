LEONARD: It's my condition. I never know if I've already eaten, so I always just eat small amounts.
TEDDY: You don't have to remember to be hungry.
LEONARD: It's weird, but if you don't eat for a while then your body stops being hungry. You get sort of shaky but you don't realize you haven't eaten. Have I told you about Sammy Jankis?
TEDDY: Yeah, yeah. I heard enough about him. Tell me about John G. You still think he's here, right?
LEONARD: Who?
TEDDY: The guy you're looking for, Johnny G. That's why you haven't left. Am I right?
LEONARD: Why?
TEDDY: Well, the other day you made it sound like you thought somebody might be trying to set you up. Get you to kill the wrong guy.
LEONARD: Yeah, well I go on facts, not recommendations, okay?
TEDDY: Lenny, you can't trust a man's life to your little notes and pictures.
LEONARD: Why?
: 30.
TEDDY: Because you're relying on them alone. You Don't remember what you've discovered or how. Your notes might be unreliable.
