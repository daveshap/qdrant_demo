Data entry/Lockbox job at a bank: What's it like?
I'm considering trying for a lockbox processor job in the offices of a major bank because I'm looking for something centered around data entry.  However, try as I might, I cannot get a good sense of what this job entails.  I know that it involves entering remittances from checks.  Aside from that, I can find no info on how much financial or mathematical acumen is needed, how taxing/stressful a job it is, and how busy daily.  I've asked on this board and others and even asked a former co-worker who worked in a bank's offices, but still can't get an idea.

Does anyone know anything about this type of job?
