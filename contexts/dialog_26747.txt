ANSWERING MACHINE: Don't do it, Mike.
MIKE: Shut up.
NIKKI: Hi. This is Nikki. Leave a message.
MIKE: Hi, Nikki. This is Mike. I met you tonight at the Dresden. I, uh, just called to say I, uh, I'm really glad we met and you should give me a call. So call me tomorrow, or, like, in two days, whatever. My number is 213- 555-4679...
NIKKI: Hi. This is Nikki. Leave a message.
MIKE: Hi, Nikki. This is Mike, again. I just called because it sounded like your machine might've cut me off before I gave you my number, and also to say sorry for calling so late, but you were still there when I left the Dresden, so I knew I'd get your machine. Anyway, my number is...
NIKKI: Hi. This is Nikki. Leave a message.
MIKE: 213-555-4679. That's all. I just wanted to leave my number. I don't want you to think I'm weird, or desperate or something... ...I mean, you know, we should just hang out. That's it. No expectations. Just, you know, hang out. Bye.
NIKKI: Hi. This is Nikki. Leaves a message.
MIKE: I just got out of a six-year relationship. Okay? That should help to explain why I'm acting so weird. It's not you. It's me. I just wanted to say that. Sorry. This is Mike.
NIKKI: Hi. This is Nikki. Leave a message.
MIKE: Hi, Nikki. This is Mike again. Could you just call me when you get in? I'll be up for awhile, and I'd just rather talk to you in person instead of trying to squeeze it all...
NIKKI: Hi. This is Nikki. Leave a message.
MIKE: Hi, Nikki. Mike. I don't think this is working out. I think you're great, but maybe we should just take some time off from each other. It's not you, really. It's me. It's only been six months...
NIKKI: Mike?
MIKE: Nikki! Great! Did you just walk in, or were you listening all along?
NIKKI: Don't call me ever again.
MIKE: Wow, I guess you were home...
