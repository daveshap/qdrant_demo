Im surprised with how comfortable the thought of suicide has gotten with me and it scares me.
The thought of taking my own life has become surprisingly more comfortable/normal . It scares me. I have thought of it before but it was always " im never going to actually do that." But now its been cnsuming my thoughts more and more. I feel i have nothing , no one, no purpose. Im useless, i have no where to turn. The silence is deafening and the thought of taking my life just creeps up more and more and it doesnt feel so crazy anymore. This is what scares ne to se ehow my thinking has changed and maybe in a month itll be the only thing i think of. It seems im going that direction
I dont know what to really do. 
I tell nyself im being selfish and i have family that cares for me and theyll be sad but its not convincing me anymore.
i just hate how lonely i feel.
I look around and think what am i doing. Im fooling myself. I try to be happy and joke around with others. Tell myself its all in my head but i feel im losing control. 
im scared.

Edit- sorry lots of grammar and spelling errors. I'm on an old phone thats a little hard to fix
