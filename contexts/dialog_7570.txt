CHOCO: <i>Holy shit... this bitch is fierce.</i>
DOMINO: I've been training since I was twelve. Knives. Guns. Throwing stars. You name it... I can fight with it. I'm a hard worker and a fast learner. Nothing scares me. I'm not afraid to die.
ED: You want to be a bounty hunter. Why does a pretty little thing like you want to be a bounty hunter?
DOMINO: Because I want justice. I want to help put these sleazebags back in jail where they belong. And I want to have a little fun.
