Knowing When To Quit Your Job
I felt it was appropriate to share some guidelines to consider when you feel it's time to leave your job and start over. This list is a combination of my personal experience and articles I've read in making my decision to leave. When we're so comfortable in a job that we've been at for a few years, it is sometimes easy to be deceived that we're in a "good place". Just like any bad relationship, it's hard to break up when you're comfortable.

A quick background of my career history - I was a paralegal for a few years looking to change law firms due to boredom and unhappiness. Was offered a non-legal position through a temp agency for a job I did not apply for, but this new position resulted in a  free ride to law school and an entryway to an attorney position with the business. Would've never had this opportunity if I didn't take the leap of faith to quit.

**1) Quit your job if you're more often bored/dissatisfied with your days at work** 
Regardless of how happy you are at your job, we all have bad days. However, if it gets to a point where the bad days outweigh the good and you start dreading going to work because you can foresee a bad day, then it's time to reconsider your job.

I used to find myself throwing tantrums on Sunday evenings because I could not stand the thought of going to work on Monday. 

**2) Quit your job if you're underpaid**
My husband used to always ask me why I was settling for only $11/hour for a paralegal position. I used to continuously tell him that it was a good place to be and I was learning new things. His rebuttal was simply, "How do you know other places can't offer the same but for more money?" Essentially, he was right. How can you really say your position is "good" if you haven't seen what else is out there. I now make nearly triple the amount I used to and it is definitely a better place to work and it is definitely a job I keep learning in. I would have never known about this position if I didn't step out of my comfort zone.

**3) Quit your job if you're being verbally abused by your boss** 
When we're too comfortable in our position, it's as if office etiquette flies out the door because coworkers start feeling like family. Regardless how close your peers become, the office is still the office. My previous boss used to cuss up a storm and emotionally abuse us when our working performance was not up to par. I truly believed this was just how a typical law office was like and any "good" company would push their employees in the same fashion. Wrong! I now work in a Fortune 500 company and no one would dare treat their employees like such.  

**4) Don't be afraid of the unknown** 
What if I don't like my new job? What if I lose a good opportunity here? Stop thinking of the negative and think "What if I never made the change?" If you're even in a place where you're daydreaming of a new job, then maybe that's where you need to go. The change in my life started with simply applying to as many legal jobs, but the search concluded with a job that was offered to me through a temp agency. Even though the position had nothing to do with my career choice, I still chose not to fear the unknown. You never know what's on the other side of the road you'll take, so the best way to take that route is to simply go for it and don't look back.

**TL;DR - Quit your job if you're bored, underpaid, and abused. Don't be scared :)**
