Does SQL Server use (unused)index stats for optimizer I am wondering about unused index in MS SQL Server. By the Index usage DMV I can identify an index which has not been used for seeks, scans or lookups.However I know from Oracle that an index might not be used in such a way in a execution plan, however it can still contribute statistics/cardinality information to the (Oracle) optimizer. This contribution is not monitored in the same way.So I am wondering if in MSSQL a Index can have a similar positive effect even when it is not directly used (in a representative time frame)? And specifically, if it can be better than a column statistic (I.e. dropping the index would be harmful).I haven\u2019t seen this mentioned in any of the index tuning articles I have come along, so I assume MSSQL (up to 2017) does not have this concept, is that correct?
