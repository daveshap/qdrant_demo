BRODSKI: How do you know that piece of cursed rock down there doesn't carry something metal tits can't detect?
YLLO: Well, when we rejuvenate this one you can ask her.
BRODSKI: Damnit, Yllo! I don't like it.
YLLO: I don't give a shit. This one's prime for decryonization. We're brining her back.
BRODSKI: I still think we should send for a team of real scientists.
YLLO: I am a scientist you asshole! This could be the most important discovery in 400 years. Do you have any idea what a find like this could mean?
BRODSKI: Right now, I care only for the safety of this crew. You don't know anything about these two -
BRODSKI: Jesus what the hell is that?
YLLO: That's exactly what we need to find out. Check your orders, Sergeant. I out rank you where discovery is concerned. Now step aside. I have a medical emergency to deal with.
AZRAEL: Watch it punk, I'm armed.
DALLAS: Punk?
