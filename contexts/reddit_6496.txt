Any recommendations for interviewing with a startup?
I have an interview soon for a fintech that was founded  in 2019. The pay is decent and similar role as my previous job. I would like to hear both upsides and downsides to working for a startup plus tips and advice on interviews. Also, any questions I can ask during. Thank you.
