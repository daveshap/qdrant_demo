My wife's boyfriend told me to kill myself
My wife left me in September after 8 years of marriage. This last Saturday, I received a phone call from my wife's number. When I picked up, there was a man's voice on the other end. The first question he asked was why I hadn't already killed myself. I was taken aback at first, then he kept convincing me to do it, with my wife laughing in the background. He kept saying it would be the best thing for everyone if I did so. He told me my sons wanted me to do it as well. I haven't seen them since September. They are only 7 and 6. He said they were his kids now, which made me angry and extremely upset because I am over 200 miles away from them. On Sunday, November 12th, I attempted suicide by overdosing on my heart medication. Before I was fully unconscious, my sister stopped by because she hadn't heard from me in over a day. When I came to, I was in the trauma unit upside down with tubes in my nose and neck, one pumping the contents of my stomach out, while the other was desperately pumping dopamine into my bloodstream. After spending 48 hours in the ICU, I'm home. I have an appointment on the 22nd of November with a therapist and a doctor, but I don't think that's soon enough. I'm scared. And ashamed. And I feel even more alone. I miss my wife and my children dearly. Which makes this so difficult to comprehend. I still can't believe that someone could say that to another human being. It cut deeper than any wound I could possibly imagine.
