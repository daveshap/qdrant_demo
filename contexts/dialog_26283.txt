GILLIS: How did it go?
NORMA: It couldn't have gone better. It's practically set. Of course, he has to finish this picture first, but mine will be his next.
GILLIS: He must be quite a guy.
NORMA: He'a a shrewd old fox. He can smell box office. Only I'm going to outfox him a litt1e. This isn't going to be C. B. deMille's Salome. It's going to be Norma Desmond's Salome, a Norma Desmond Production, starring Norma Desmond...Home, Max.
