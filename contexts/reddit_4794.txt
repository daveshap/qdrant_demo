I have let myself go, how can I get myself back?
Update: I brushed my teeth this morning. I am incredibly touched...like, actually crying (nothing new there!) by those who took the time to respond and offer suggestions and words of encouragement. I also saw some of you who could relate, please feel free to message me at any time...I always feel better when I see there are other people who feel the way I do because depression can be so isolating. Here's to all of you, and me brushing my teeth again tomorrow <3  

Throughout my youth I was always considered "pretty", I had a lot of friends and an active dating life. Then, about 5 years ago-I had a major depressive episode, this lead to medication changes, which led to weight gain. In the past 5 years, I've gained 100 lbs. I can't remember the person I used to be, she seems so far away. It's almost like I've lived two lives, the then and the now. Sometimes I sleep in so late, I end up leaving the house without brushing my hair or my teeth. I know what I need to do and what I should do to fix this all, but everything just seems so far out of reach. I guess I will begin by brushing my teeth tomorrow before I leave my apartment....
