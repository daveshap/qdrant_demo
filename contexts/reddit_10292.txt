I'm still here
2019 was filled with 3 suicide attempts and 4 hospitalizations. I'm pretty sure I spent almost all of my year wishing I was dead. Despite this, I'm getting better. I'm finally on meds. I've reconnected with old friends, and became much more social. There are some days where I feel like giving up, but I know I'm stronger than my thoughts. I'm managing, I hope you are too. Please stay safe.
