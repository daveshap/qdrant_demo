Is it possible to make good money outside of an office job?
I make decent money climbing up corporate ladder type jobs and I am wondering is it even possible to start over and make decent money outside of an office setting? Decent meaning East coast cost of living, go to games , restaurants , etc and keep lifestyle intact.  Seems like a lot if jobs pay very little . Does anyone have any insight?
