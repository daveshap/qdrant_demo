BRANDON: Hello, Mitchell. Having fun?
MITCHELL: The liquors lovely. The rest of the party you can have.
MITCHELL: What's the matter, baby. Don't you like me anymore?
BRANDON: Lay off, can't you?
MITCHELL: Lay off what? This is my new girl friend. Met her on the train. She's very fond of me. Love at first sight. Wasn't it, baby?
