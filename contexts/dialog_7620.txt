EDDIE: You're right. Roberta Sparrow was famous for her gem collections. Kids used to try and steal stuff from her all the time. Over the years... as she got older, she became more and more of a recluse... now she just likes to stay up there all by herself.
DONNIE: I guess she just lost faith in the world.
DR. THURMAN: How many times have you seen Frank?
DONNIE: Four times... so far.
DR. THURMAN: Can anyone else see him?
DONNIE: I don't think so. It's like a TV station. And they're tuned into mine and no one else's.
DR. THURMAN: Who is they? Is Frank part of some larger group?
DONNIE: I don't know. Gretchen has a theory. That Frank is a sign. I told her I thought it was ridiculous.
DR. THURMAN: A sign from whom?
DONNIE: I think that Frank wants me to go to this woman. She wrote a book about time travel. Frank asked me if I believed in time travel. That can't just be a random coincidence. My dad almost hit her with the car the other day, and she said the creepiest thing. She said that every living creature on this earth dies alone.
DR. THURMAN: How does that make you feel?
DONNIE: It reminded me of my dog Callie.
DR. THURMAN: Is Callie still around?
DONNIE: No. She died when I was eight. We couldn't find her for days. She went and crawled underneath our back porch...
DR. THURMAN: Do you feel alone right now?
DONNIE: I'd like to believe that I'm not... but I've just never seen any proof. So I just choose not to bother with it. It's, like, I could spend my whole life thinking about it... debating it in my head. Weighing the pros and cons. And in the end, I still wouldn't have any proof. So... I don't even debate it any more. Because it's absurd. I don't want to be alone. So, does that make me, like, an atheist?
DR. THURMAN: No. That makes you keep searching.
