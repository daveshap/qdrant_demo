I can’t stop thinking about my best friend after what happened
So I’ll add a little bit of background info for this one, last night (when I’m writing this) I was at my best friends house for a sleepover, 2 of our other best friends were there aswell, I’ll change their names up for this story, so there’s me, Danielle (that’s my real name btw haha) I’m bisexual, there’s Heather, Skoliosexual (possibly pansexual she’s still figuring stuff out) then there’s Melanie and Katelyn they aren’t interested in dating and find it disgusting (I’ve asked if they’re asexual but they claim they aren’t) anyway we had a sleepover last night at Heathers house and me and Heather we have quite a lot in common and she was one of the people who I told first after me and my first girlfriend got together and broke up so me and her are really close. We have this inside joke that we’re married to each other (weird I know 😂😅) and at this sleepover we were kinda like flirting a little but then we were hugging and in the background Melanie and Katelyn were playing some kinda cheesy love songs in my opinion haha, and me and Heather were lying down on the mattress while like hugging up with each other and then I thought about and lesbian mini movie I saw on YouTube were something kinda similar to this happened and I pointed it out, and then Katelyn brung up something that happened at a sleepover about 7-8 months ago (I’ve known Katelyn since the beginning of primary school) where I kissed another girl and sung ‘I kissed a girl’ after it as a joke (I hadn’t come out of the closet yet so the girl I kissed didn’t know I was bisexual, to be fair I kinda thought I was straight at the time) and then Melanie told Heather “I think you should kiss Danielle” and put on ‘I kissed a girl’ and then Heather said she had cherry chapstick as a joke and then she put it on, then it was at the first “I kissed a girl and I liked it” and me and Heather kissed, but since I was nervous I came in too aggressively she told me to do it again and then we ended up doing it again and again til the song was over . But it was moving so so quickly like I was on top of Heather, she was on top of me it was, amazing. So amazing we ended up doing it with the song on all over again. It was one of the best parts of the night haha (I’m such a horny spaz..) but after I was red as a tomato, Melanie was crying, Katelyn and Melanie were pretty grossed out (they’re not homophobic just grossed out by dating in general) and then Melanie was like “I didn’t think you’d actually do it!” And then it kinda all came to me
“I think I like Heather” 
but then later Katelyn told me that Heather said she wasn’t into it (I highly think she was because after it she pinned me down on the bed 😅😂) and my heads been messed up all day because of it, like I don’t know if I should ask out Heather, if I should just try not to think of it but, it’s been really hard 
What should I do?

EDIT: So I asked Heather a little while ago how she felt when we kissed and she wasn’t into it 😅:( but I’m over it now, I got a new girlfriend a little over a week ago and Heathers still one of my best friends so it’s all worked out well 😊
