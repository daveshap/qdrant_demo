MARY: I want sleep more than anything. Except maybe, food.
NORMAN: There's a big diner about ten miles on up... just outside Fairvale.
MARY: Am I that close to Fairvale?
NORMAN: Fifteen miles. I'll get your bags.
NORMAN: Stuffy in here. Well... the mattress is soft and there're hangers in the closet and... stationary with Bates' Motel" printed on it in case you want to make your friends back home envious... and... the... over there...."
MARY: The bathroom.
NORMAN: I'll be in the office if you want anything... just tap on the wall.
MARY: Thank you, Mr. Bates.
NORMAN: Norman Bates.
NORMAN: You have something most girls never have.
MARY: I have?
NORMAN: There's no name for it... But it's something that, that puts a person at ease.
MARY: Thank you. Again.
NORMAN: You're not going to go out again and drive up to that diner, are you?
MARY: No.
NORMAN: Then will you do me a favor? Will you have supper here? I was just about to, myself... nothing more than some sandwiches and a lot of milk, but I'd like it if you'd come up to the house and... I don't set a fancy table but... the kitchen's awful homey.
MARY: I'd like to.
NORMAN: All right, you get your dresses hanging out and... change those wet shoes, and I'll come for you soon as it's ready... ...with my trusty umbrella.
