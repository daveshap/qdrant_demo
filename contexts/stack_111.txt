Reinstalling iMovie on a mid 2009 MacBook Pro I accidentally uninstalled my iMovie from my MacBook Pro mid 2009. Thing is, when I go to the app store and try to reinstall it, I can't \u2013 my system's too old.When I try to get an old version of iMovie, they're just updates \u2013 not the core application itself.I need any (really... any!) version of iMovie running by today because I have an urgent video edition due. Anyone has any clue about how to reinstall the iMovie on my old MacBook?
