Internal University 5k grant
Hi,

My university has a 5k competitive grant process for any department willing to submit a submission. I work in the disability services office. Are there any programs/equipment/services your disability office offers that might be worthwhile to bring to our campus? We are a public California university so our weather is generally good. (I only mention this in case folks have ideas to mitigate weather barriers for students.) 

Thanks!
