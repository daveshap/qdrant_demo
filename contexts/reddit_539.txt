im broke when i shouldn't be
What should i do. i'm younger than 14 and i got a total sum of $320 from various sources over the last 2 years; my parents, behind my back used the money. I only found this out when i had decided i wanted to buy something with the money. When i asked my mom she said that our "finances are tight and she'll get the money back by July, but the item i want is limited edition and is almost out of stock. I feel in debt to her because she is my mum also all my friend's are saying that the item is super neat and the all want to see it irl and i have to keep making excuses. This item NOT fortnite related?
