What would be the pros and cons of transferring all current public, government run roads, into the hands of private ownership?
[Private roads, otherwise known as free-market roads,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-market_roads) is a system of roads that are owned entirely by private companies and entities.

According to Freedom Economic Education, they claim that [free market roads would help end congestion](https://fee.org/articles/privately-owned-roads-would-end-congestion/). Advocates also reflect back to the early days of America's expansion, and how many of the roads were [private, thus helping fuel development and investment.](https://www.accessmagazine.org/spring-1993/private-toll-roads-in-america-the-first-time-around/)

However, other reports claim that [private roads would increase costs through tolls, spiking during "peak hours" like those done on the London Underground and Uber](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2018-02-07/privatizing-roads-was-a-great-idea-not-anymore), and [fail to maintain road condition.](https://www.accessmagazine.org/spring-1993/private-toll-roads-in-america-the-first-time-around/)

Have there been examples in the past, or in other countries, where all (or a majority) of roads were privately owned? 

In countries that have vast private road system, was there a decrease or increase of cost on consumers of the road?

Would limiting people's access to travel under burden of cost, be a violation of any human rights?
