People that have been laid off: How did you handle it?
I just found out today that the company I've worked for for just under 8 years is laying me off. I have 1 week to get everything together and transfer my stuff to whoever takes over my duties in the 'new organizational structure'. 

I have been considering leaving and lightly job searching for a few months now, so this isn't a HUGE loss for me, but it still feels devastating. I'll be 29 two days after I'm officially terminated (great birthday present, eh?!), and in the history of my company, they haven't done lay-offs like this where they get rid of people who've been there less than 20+ years... so it was a bit of a surprise. I just finished my BA (literally this weekend) and I just bought a house - everything seemed to be going really well and then BOOOOM. I'm out of a job.

Anyway, does anyone have tips on how to stay positive through it and maybe where to start with moving forward? I kept my emotions together in the meeting but I'm struggling now. Lol.
