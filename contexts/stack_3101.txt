Why High Voltage Power Lines need more Insulation than a low one? \"A 400 kV cable requires less insulation than a 240V cable.\"This was regarded as False in one of my question papers, but why? Doesn't a higher voltage means, lower current(P=V. I) and a lower voltage means higher current which brings us to P=I2.R | Therefore the higher the current, the more power is lost as heat, and shouldn't this mean the 240V cable needs to be insulated more?
