Fuck you chemistry.
I was a 4.0 student in school up until the second semester of my senior year. Ever since then I've been a lazy slob and every part of me doesn't want to be anymore. I came to college this semester as a freshman and was pretty much drunk for the first two months. I've tried so hard to get back to my hard working self. I joined hall council and student government. I volunteer for around four hours every Friday. I am part of an organization that matches foreign exchange students with English speaking students who help them with their English.

Due to partying too much early in the semester my grades were not something I was proud of. I've been working hard to get my grades up. Every class is up at least 1 whole letter grade except for fucking chemistry. I finally have my work ethic back, the only thing I'll ever be proud of. But turns out I naturally suck at chemistry. I've always thought anyone can learn anything if they put enough time and smart effort into it. But this class is testing that philosophy to the limit. I know I can do it, but I just seeing the uphill battle ahead of me is pretty disheartening.

I want to go to med school and also be a multicultural advisor at my college but my mistakes this semester seriously make me hate myself just a bit. Fuck me I can be so stupid.

I've decided I won't give up and that I want to do good in this world. I need to spend my time with purpose. So fuck you chemistry I will master your ass if it's the last thing I do. You're the hardest thing I haven't been able to overcome within a month and I will master you.

My message for you is to go master your own chemistry. That is all.

Also if you have any advice when it comes to studying the sciences I would appreciate it.
