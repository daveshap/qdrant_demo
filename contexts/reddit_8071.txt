Advice wanted for grad school choice
Hi all, I’m hoping you can help me with this decision.

I’m hoping to go to grad school for a position that needs a grad degree in order for me to practice. (Licensed Mental Health Counselor)

I’m planning on going in 18 months after saving enough money to not take out any loans in order to go.

Currently I live in a HCOL area in affordable housing (read: about 20% of my income) and make about $52,000 a year. My job is manageable and provided good health care and benefits but not what I want to do for long term.

The decision is this:

I could apply to a state school program of which only 6 people get in each year, where I have to take two courses at a community college and a GRE before applying. The program costs $26,000 in tuition over a two years being a full-time student. I would have to move to the town where the school is (and housing is more affordable there) but I would have to quit my job and give up benefits. The kicker is, I have the options of working as a Teaching Assistant and having that pay for most of my tuition. So the program is essentially free minus what I need to stay alive, which isn’t much. Also, I could not get in initially and have to wait another year before applying again.

OR

I could go to CityU, pay $52,000, rolling admission and more lax application process but the program is three years and designed to be done while working a full-time job. I wouldn’t have to quit or move, and I wouldn’t get the opportunity to teach college classes.

Do I go through the hoops and try to go to the practically free full-time program or do I try to balance both work and school to pay for a more expensive part-time program but would hopefully get to continue working at my job?

I know this is probably a “well do what you value more” kind of question, so if that’s where you’re leaning please tell me what you would do in this situation.

Thanks to anyone who participates!
