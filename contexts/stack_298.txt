Removing a debit card from apple wallet I have a debit card in apple wallet that I no longer use. The card has actually been deactivated by my bank because I requested a new card.When I attempt to add the new card I get an error, \u2018invalid card\u2019. I\u2019m certain I typed in everything correctly.I try to remove the old card first but I do not see it anywhere in wallet until I attempt to add a new card. How do I delete the old card from apple wallet if I do not see it in the wallet?
