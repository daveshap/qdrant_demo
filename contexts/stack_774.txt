Problem on Windows after DualBoot (Windows 10 / Ubuntu 18.04 LTS) I downloaded the ISO of the new Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, made a Bootable USB, created an empty partition next to the Windows partition. I booted with the pendrive and followed the installation of Ubuntu normally in the new partition.My goal was to install Ubuntu 18.04 next to Windows 10 (LEGACY), but at the end of the whole installation, Ubuntu normally entered by selecting the option in GRUB. However when selecting Windows 10 in Grub, a black screen appears and stays forever.I've tried all the Grub repair solutions that I found and nothing worked. The Windows option appears in Grub, but it no longer works.I have a lot of things working inside Windows, and if you can help me with this, I'll be very grateful !!Thank you all!
