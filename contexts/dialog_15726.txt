ARDELIA: Not random at all, maybe. Like there's some pattern here...?
CLARICE: But there is no pattern. There's no connection at all among these places, or the computers would've nailed it! They're even found in random order.
ARDELIA: Well, except for the one girl.
CLARICE: What girl?

CLARICE: Fredrica Bimmel, from Belvedere, Ohio. The first girl taken, but the third body found... Why?
ARDELIA: 'Cause she didn't drift. He weighted her down.
CLARICE: But why? He didn't weight the others.
