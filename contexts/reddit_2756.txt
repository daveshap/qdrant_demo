I quit, but my job is still scheduling me?
So, I handed in my two weeks notice three weeks ago, and my employer seemed fine with it. She didn’t ask me to stay past the date I stated as my last day or anything, but I’m still being scheduled? I had shifts for this week and next week, but I’m no longer working there. I haven’t showed up to any of them, but I’m not really sure what to do? This was my first job so I haven’t had any experience with this kind of thing before.

Edit: Ok, thank you guys for the advice! I’ve let them know more than once that I don’t work there anymore, so I’m just going to leave it be. Sorry if this question came off as kinda dumb, I’ve just never quit a job before and didn’t know if I’d done something wrong. Thanks again :)
