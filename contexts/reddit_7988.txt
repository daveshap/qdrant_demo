Health insurance
Hi everyone,

For 2019-2020 I applied to a few grad schools and received a few offers for PhD programs. One is really tempting and the program seems really good but only issue that is keeping me from accepting the offer is that  it doesnâ€™t have health insurance. I checked their website and they do not even have subsidized health insurance at all for any graduated students. Is this a good sign for the program and how do people people survive without health insurance?
