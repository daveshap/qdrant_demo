After 22 years, my student loans are FINALLY paid in full
I wish I was here with advice or wisdom to help you do the same. I'm not. I'm here as a cautionary tale to tell you what not to do.

I graduated with a degree in mathematics in 1997.  I can not precisely tell you what my loan balance was (cautionary tale, remember?) but it was probably around $30,000.  Yep. You read that right.  $30,000 and it took me 22 years to get it dealt with.

Over those years, I defaulted twice.  Had wages garnished twice.  Went into a repayment program after the first default and was doing pretty darn well until 2016.  Had a bunch of personal stuff happen, and ended up in default again.  I didn't open my mail. I dodged every phone call from them.  I just couldn't face the idea of talking to them.  I got really lucky and got a bonus at work.  They garnished part of that, and it was enough to finally pay off the loans.  I'm free.

But - if I had just communicated with them and kept myself together, I could have been free years ago.  

I do have a tiny bit of advice learned from the school of hard knocks:

When bill collectors call you, they can be jerks.  However, if YOU call THEM, it's a different story - at least when it comes to student loans.  Sit down today and call them if you are in arrears.  Talk to them and don't bury your head in the sand.  They can do things to help you avoid defaulting - or help you sort it out if you have defaulted.  I know it's no fun. I know it's mortifying.  But, if you suck it up and make the call, it will be better in the long run.  It will give you a path to freedom.
