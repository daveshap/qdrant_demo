ARCHIE: That really you, Red?
MALCOLM: You saved my life, Archie. Running me out of Harlem. When I think how close we came to gunning each other down, I have to thank Allah.

ARCHIE: Yeah. I got a couple a new angles ain't been figured yet. All I need's a stake and a chance --
MALCOLM: Can you use a few bucks? I ain't got much, but --
ARCHIE: No, man, I'm doing okay. Thanks.
MALCOLM: Take it easy. Lay down and don't think about it.
ARCHIE: Yeah.
MALCOLM: You could of been something, Archie, but the devil got to you.
