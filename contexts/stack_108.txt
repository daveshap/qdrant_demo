Can I prevent some iPhone apps from needing to be reloaded? Recently some iPhone apps which are already installed are not available when clicked. I noticed recently some apps I don\u2019t use often need to be reloaded. I assume this is some kind of memory reallocation innovation to make room for all of my favorite podcasts. It happens like this, I click on an icon, and a clock-like loading animation covers the icon and it\u2019s unavailable until it\u2019s \u201creloaded\u201d. Ok. But this necessitates WiFi, and near impossible to reload while on the train, for example.Today I was not able to use my gmail app, and more importantly Transit app were unavailable when I needed them. I absolutely can\u2019t have Transit app ever unavailable or requiring download  as I rely it to find alternate routes home during my NYC commute to work and home.Is there a way to prevent certain critical third-party apps from unloading?
