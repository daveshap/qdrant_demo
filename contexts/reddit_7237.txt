How long should it take someone to fully be on their own in a new job?
I’m 24. I started my new job 2 weeks ago as a legal assistant. Professionally, my background is in criminal law and drug and alcohol. 

I had an internship in probation and parole with a full caseload which is why I was hired for this job with the public defenders office - they use the same programs and procedures tend to cross over. They flat out told me they didn’t want to have to train someone. 

I understand just about everything, I’m doing my own work filing motions, doing paperwork, managing cases with no questions whatsoever. I’ve essentially been thrown to the sharks, sink or swim. However, I also handle bench warrants and extraditions that I didn’t have to deal with in this aspect. 

Warrants and extraditions are very complex, there’s a lot of steps required and one size doesn’t fit all. When it comes to this, I’m constantly asking questions and I’m getting confused easily. I’m not doing them consistently because those hearings are only MWF and I could have 0 or 10 to do. 

The people around me tell me that it takes a while to understand and encourage the questions. I just feel bad asking questions a lot and feel like I’m annoying at this point. 

How long should it take someone to fully understand what the hell is going on? When do employers begin to get annoyed with a new employee?
