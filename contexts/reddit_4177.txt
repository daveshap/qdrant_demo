Hello reddit,

I've just completely purged my social medias because I no longer feel the need to keep them. No one talks to me. No one goes out of their way to contact me. I feel as if I'm talking to a wall at certain points. I just don't understand why I can't keep people in my life. Naturally I'm not a shitty person, I'm actually very selfless. I always tend to put other before myself.... Maybe that's the root of my issue....

I just want friends. I want someone I can trust and I don't know how to put myself out there and I don't know how to appeal to people in a way that will make them want to stick around.

For some reason it just feels like no one wants to deal with me or be a friend to me and i have no idea as to why ....


*Update: I now have an Instagram which is x.tva.x 

I decided to give it another shot as far as meeting friends and trying to keep in touch with ones I really enjoyed. Plus, Reddit people seem cool ðŸ˜Š
