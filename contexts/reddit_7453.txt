I'm almost done??
It's weird, I have been in school for most of my 23 years here on this Earth. Once I submit my paper tomorrow and if I pass everything (fingers crossed) I'll have a Master's in Medieval History. This is such a surreal thing.

  
PhD stuff didn't pan out this year so I'm reapplying next year but this is so weird. It's done??? What do I do now besides worry about papers and research?? I am applying to jobs and working as a caretaker, babysitter, and dogsitter right now as I wait for the job market to unfreeze and for jobs to get back to me but it's so weird. It almost feels anticlimatic but also very scary.

Anyone else gets what I mean?
