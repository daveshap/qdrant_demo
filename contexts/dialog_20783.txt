LISA: Joe?
JOE: Yeah... ?
LISA: Two men making love... ? Now tell me again... <u>why</u> is that disgusting?
JOE: Lisa, c'mon. One guy sticking his dick in another guy's mouth? It's disgusting.
LISA: Okay, so... help me with this one, Joe... Is it disgusting for someone to put his dick into someone's mouth? Or, is it disgusting for someone to take a dick into <u>their</u> mouth?
JOE: Great, Lisa. Thank you.
