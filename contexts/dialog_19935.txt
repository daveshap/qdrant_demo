BETTY: Did you watch it yet?
SUE ANN: Sure did. I'll tell you, if that man was any better looking it'd be a crime 'a some sort...
BETTY: Yep. Hey, I got a surprise for tonight. We're going to the Starlite in style!
SUE ANN: Oh, Betty --
BETTY: I'll give you a hint. If you scrunch up your eyes a bit it looks just like a Jaguar...
SUE ANN: Honey, I'm really sorry, I was gonna call you about tonight. Larry's got a lodge meeting. There's no way I can get a sitter this fast.
BETTY: No... what about your sister?
SUE ANN: I can't ask her again -- Nathan, stop it! Jesse, don't take that, hit back! -- I feel terrible, hon.
BETTY: It's all right.
SUE ANN: You sure? Maybe next week we could...
BETTY: Uh-huh. No, we'll do it later. 'S only a birthday, right? I'll have another one next year...
SUE ANN: Aahhh... So what color is it?
BETTY: What?
SUE ANN: The LeSabre!
BETTY: Maroon. I stole it.
SUE ANN: What?
BETTY: He wasn't going to let us use it, so I just took it.
SUE ANN: Oh, I wish we could just get in it and drive, and drive, and drive!
BETTY: Yeah, me too.
SUE ANN: Sorry, hon. Happy Birthday...
BETTY: I gotta go make dinner.
BETTY: Sure you don't want any salad?
DEL: No, I do not want any goddamn... what was all that shit on the phone about the new Buicks?
BETTY: I told you. Sue Ann was gonna take me out tonight, but...
DEL: She's not comfortable in a Corsica? 'S got air and leather...
BETTY: I took the blue Corsica, Del. Relax.
DEL: All right, then. Actually, I'm glad you're going out. I got something going on tonight. Some serious clients, with real potential.
BETTY: ...like the water purifiers?
DEL: What?
BETTY: Or the vitamins? Or the...?
DEL: Hey, the FDA screwed me on that when they changed the law, and you know it! Anyway, 'least I try shit, still got some dreams left... you're a goddamn waitress, what do you got?
BETTY: I got you, Del...
DEL: ...well, then you ain't got much.
BETTY: Oh, I know. So, who're these clients?
DEL: Couple 'a guys in from outta town. They want to see the new LeSabres.
DEL: And I don't need Sue Ann's fat ass around to fuck it up...
BETTY: Just knock it off, 'kay? Anyhow, they're 97's, they're not even new.
DEL: They're new to us...
