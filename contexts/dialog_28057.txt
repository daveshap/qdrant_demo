LADDIE: I had the dream again about <u>them</u>.
STAR: Who, Laddie?
LADDIE: I know it was them, Star. I'm sure of it. He was working in the yard -- hammering something. The yard was big with lots of grass. There was no boardwalk and no ocean. She was bringing him something cold to drink... and had red hair. I was there, too. And a dog -- but I don't know its name. I was running and the dog was chasing me. Then I turned around and chased the dog. They were watching me. Drinking their cold drinks and laughing. And I was laughing, too.
STAR: Laddie... you can <u>still</u> remember. You can still remember home.
LADDIE: It was a dream, Star.
STAR: No, Laddie. It was a <u>memory</u>.
STAR: You didn't tell David?
LADDIE: No. Just you.
STAR: Promise me you'll keep it that way. You're not like the others, Laddie. You're like me. I can still remember, too.
LADDIE: You like Michael.
STAR: I like Michael.
LADDIE: You better not like him too much.
