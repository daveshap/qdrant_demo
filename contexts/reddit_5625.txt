How to get a job at a cafe (NYC)?
I’m a college student currently off for summer. I’m back home in New York City and really want to get a part-time job at a cafe until college begins (which is who knows when). 

I’ve applied to at least FIFTY cafe/ barista/ server jobs this week on sites like LinkedIn, New York Coffee Jobs, and Indeed. I’ve emailed places that state they’re hiring on their websites. I’ve even custom-tailored my resume to not include my college background (in case of “over-qualifications”) and to only include relevant experience. I’ve spent a LOT of time writing a decent cover letter as well.

Yet, I’ve heard NOTHING back. Is it ok to just walk into a cafe or restaurant and ask if they’re hiring?? I really want a job and don’t know what to do.
