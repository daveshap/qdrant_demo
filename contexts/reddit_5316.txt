Is This Harassment?
Throwaway for obvious reasons.

I live in an at-will employment state. I'm an exempt salaried worker. I haven't signed a contract of any kind. 

&#x200B;

Now that that's out of the way, down to business. Due to new management, our formerly flexible office (which allows people to work periodically) has turned into a hellscape where we're required to stay in our seats at all times. I do not work a job that should require this, as most of my work is done on a computer without input from other people. So, to avoid the noise, I often leave the area and work elsewhere in the open office.

This behavior has put a target on my back, and now I've received disciplinary action from this new manager in spite of being in my seat the vast majority of the time. We had the discussion, and my manager told me that I wasn't in trouble per se, but that we were just correcting a behavior. So, I had PTO scheduled for the next couple of weeks and figured if I'm not in 'trouble', why would it hurt to take it? It was on the calendar as requested, but I've apparently received a flurry of emails in my absence which I haven't been checking due to PTO. 

&#x200B;

So, rather than wait until I'm back, new manager has decided to send me certified mail demanding that I check my email or call her during my PTO. This has never been an expectation in the past as we don't have company provided phones.

So ultimately, is this harassment? Do I have any case here?
