The list I keep on my phone to help me calm down during high stress and anxiety
Not sure it will help anyone else but here is a list of stuff I keep on my phone to help me calm down during moments of high stress and anxiety.  I have been slowly adding to this list over the past 4 years when I first started experiencing daily panic attacks and now I find myself rarely referring to it. Hope it helps someone else!

**Note to Self**

* Give it 20 minutes.
* When you have a negative thought, replace it with a positive one or make up a positive one and fake it til you make it.
* The more I say “fuck it”, the better I feel.
* It’s just your thoughts.
* I don't know what's going to happen in the future but I know everything is going to be okay.
* You got this. You know you're competent enough so that you won't fail in life.
* What’s the worst that can happen if you fail? Nothing.
* Look at the grand scheme of things. Don’t focus so much in the moment. There will be a tomorrow.
* You don’t have to do anything.
* It’s not what I have to do. It’s what I want to do.
* If you feel doomed, that’s because that’s what anxiety tends to do. It escalates a situation that, in reality, isn’t going anywhere.
* Don’t be afraid of your anxiety.
* You are the play, and the world is your audience.
* You shouldn’t be scared. Treat the event or activity as a challenge or opportunity.
* Why do you feel like you have to do anything? You don’t have to do anything.
* The best thing to do is not think about it.
* Staying in the situation will teach your body that everything is ok and there’s nothing to worry about.

(I know some things on this list repeat but I left them there for reinforcement)

**4-7-8 Breathing Technique**

* First, let your lips part. Make a whooshing sound, exhaling completely through your mouth.
* Next, close your lips, inhaling silently through your nose as you count to four in your head.
* Then, for seven seconds, hold your breath.
* Make another whooshing exhale from your mouth for eight seconds.
* Repeat.

**AWARE Calming Technique**

* Accept the anxiety. Don’t try to fight it, because it will not take away the anxiety.
* Watch the anxiety. Tell yourself which changes in your body and perception you notice and try to look at yourself as if you are an observer of yourself.
* Act normal. Breath normal and remain calm. Don’t try to escape because that will make you experience your symptoms even more intense. Instead, stay in the situation and experience the anxiety fading away.
* Repeat the steps 1, 2 and 3. If the anxiety is not reduced to an acceptable level yet, then repeat the steps. You’ll see that you’ll calm down soon.
* Expect the best. Practice makes perfect, so practice a lot. Don’t focus on what may happen to you, because that chance is really small.

**Other**

* As cliched as it sounds, I really recommend trying to live one day at a time. You're overwhelming yourself by trying to do too much/fix too much/make too many decisions at once. Try to breath, enjoy each day as it comes, and give yourself small goals to get back on track.

Edit: Wow! This post really blew up from when I posted it during an anxiety attack. I'm glad that so many people find it useful and hope you guys gain as much mileage from this list as I have. :D
