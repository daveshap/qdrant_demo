VON SWIETEN: This is embarrassing, you know. You introduced Mozart to some of my friends and he's begging from practically all of them. It has to stop.
SALIERI: I agree, Baron.
VON SWIETEN: Can't you think of anyone who might commission some work from him? I've done my best. I got him to arrange some Bach for my Sunday concerts. He got a fee - what I could afford. Can't you think of anyone who might do something for him?
SALIERI: No, Baron, no. I'm afraid Mozart is a lost cause. He has managed to alienate practically the whole of Vienna. He is constantly drunk. He never pays his debts. I can't think of one person to whom I dare recommend him.
VON SWIETEN: How sad. It's tragic, isn't it? Such a talent.
SALIERI: Indeed. Just a moment - as a matter of fact I think I do know someone who could commission a work from him. A very appropriate person to do so. Yes.
