STEPHANIE: Hey, guys. How's it going?
JACK: Excellent. My friend and I are up here doing the wine tour, and he tells me that you folks make one hell of a Syrah.
STEPHANIE: That's what people say.
MILES: You gotta excuse him. Yesterday he didn't know Pinot Noir from film noir.
JACK: I'm a quick learner.
