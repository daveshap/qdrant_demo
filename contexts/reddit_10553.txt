I tried hanging myself but feel happier
i tried hanging myself a couple hours ago. i had planned it all day. i even asked for help for the first time ever. but still up until the hanging i felt hopeless. 
it didn’t work because i hung it too low and i was able to push myself out before i could breath my last breath. 
i took down the rope, got into bed, finished homework due today i guess and here i am. 
i feel happy though. not happy to be alive but just happy that a part of me is still fighting to live. i’m not sure how long this feeling will last but i do still intend on getting help because i’m worried that one day, when i’m not ready for it, i’ll just give up. 
i’m not sure where to go from here or how to hide the burning red mark across my neck but i do know i’m the happiest i’ve been in a while.
