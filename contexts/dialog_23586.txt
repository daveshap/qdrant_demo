GEORGE: Yeah, baby...
JILL: How did it go at the bank?
GEORGE: Great.
JILL: Could I talk to you for a second?
GEORGE: Hey, I'm, you know --
JILL: Could I?
GEORGE: Yeah.
JILL: I said I wasn't sure if I could go.
GEORGE: Go where?
JILL: Egypt!
GEORGE: Oh, great, listen, baby, I gotta get back, okay?
JILL: Okay, but how did it go at the bank?
GEORGE: Great... can we talk later?
NORMAN: George!
GEORGE: Yeah.
NORMAN: You're late, we're all backed up and you're supposed to go to Buffums.
GEORGE: Buffums?
NORMAN: Yes, Buffums.
GEORGE: I've got heads here, Norman.
NORMAN: You promised you'd do the show.
GEORGE: Oh fuck, Norman!
NORMAN: Don't use that tone of voice with me... never mind, I'll take Gordon.
RICCI: Do you know what that Lillian Bercovici just did?
GEORGE: No, man.
RICCI: -- Right after I sprayed her?
GEORGE: What?
RICCI: She touched it! Then she played in it and got it all into something else. Now I don't know what it is!
RICCI: I can't even stand to talk to her on the phone.
GEORGE: She's heavy. See, Norman expects me to get in here, take care of all the customers and then do his show out in Norwalk. I gotta have my own shop, just out of self defense.
FELICIA: I can see that.
GEORGE: You're looking great, baby.
FELICIA: What're you doing later?
GEORGE: Whatever you say.
FELICIA: We have this political thing tonight. Could you comb me out at the house?
GEORGE: I don't know. I'm beginning to feel guilty.
FELICIA: What about?
GEORGE: All I ever do is play. I should be doing something to get my own shop open.
FELICIA: Why don't you see Lester?
GEORGE: Your husband?
FELICIA: Yes.
GEORGE: What about?
FELICIA: The shop. I think you're a good investment, and I don't mind telling him.
GEORGE: Hey, listen, baby, I'm a star.
JILL: George.
GEORGE: Hey, baby, say hello to Felicia.
JILL: I already said hello.
GEORGE: Okay.
JILL: George.
GEORGE: Yeah, baby.
JILL: When can I talk to you?
GEORGE: Baby, I'm in the middle of work.
JILL: I know but this is important. I have to make a decision.
GEORGE: About what?
JILL: Whether or not I'm going.
GEORGE: Going where?
JILL: Egypt.
GEORGE: Honey, have they offered you the job?
JILL: No, but I think they might.
GEORGE: Just a second, I'll be right with you...
FELICIA: Is she all right?
GEORGE: I don't know. Just a minute...
GEORGE: What do you want?
JILL: Your advice!
GEORGE: They didn't offer you the job yet.
JILL: I want your feelings about it.
GEORGE: Right now?
JILL: Look, either we have a meaningful relationship or we don't, I've got to know.
GEORGE: Look, baby, can we talk about it later?
JILL: When?
GEORGE: When I get off work.
JILL: When is that?
GEORGE: I'll call you.
JILL: When is that, George?
GEORGE: I'll call you.
JILL: But I never know when you're working and when you're not working!
GEORGE: Neither do I, baby.
JILL: What?
GEORGE: Nothing, I'll call you, okay?
JILL: ... Okay...
GEORGE: -- Anyway.
FELICIA: I hope she's all right.
GEORGE: She's fine. You really think I'd be a good investment?
FELICIA: I wouldn't say so if I didn't.
GEORGE: No, I know.
FELICIA: And I certainly wouldn't tell Lester.
GEORGE: I know.
FELICIA: I mean it or I wouldn't say it.
GEORGE: That's great. You look great, baby, great. Dennis, look at Felicia's hair.
