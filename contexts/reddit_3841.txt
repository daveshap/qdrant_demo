So, when a girl repeatedly says yes to a date, but won't actually agree to a specific day/time, is she saying yes or no?
...or, third option: are you insane like she's making you feel with her mixed messages?

EDIT: Jeezum Crow!! (as they said in my redneck highschool) This thread blew up!

Because I can't reply to everyone, I just want to say thanks so much for all your replies, the concensus is more or less unanimouse that **"If it's not a Hell Yes, it's a No".** The *reasons* for interpreting such mixed signals as "No" are still worth debating.... In my case I am lucky because I can be sure it's not due to lack of interest or any intention of manipulation (because the female is too sweet, flirty, and humble for those to be plausible). But it definitly may be another dude in the picture or more likely (I hope) an oppressive, toxic family situation that is the root of my woes.

Love you all, as I always will.

PS/ 2nd Edit: I'd like everyone to remember that while many women do give mixed signals and "lead men on" the motive for that is not always manipulation! In some cases, the confusion is due to the woman genuinely desiring a relationship but being tentative or even just plain scared due to previous bad relationships or trauma. All humans want some form of closeness, but most have been hurt by closeness as well. You might say the very thing we all want most is the same thing which has hurt us all the most.
