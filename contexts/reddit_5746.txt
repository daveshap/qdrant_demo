Feeling down about not being able to find a job.
I'm 25 and have never had a full time job, a couple of small time seasonal positions here and there, but nothing permanent or lasting. I know what you're thinking, 25 and never had a real job, what a loser. And I know, I think so too. I spent the last few years not doing much and falling on some hard times, got knocked down, and am only just now trying to get back up. I've applied to like 50+ places that are said to be entry level and not require any experience, and haven't heard back from anyone, I called back and haven't been able to get interviews either, and it just sucks and feels bad. I'm not looking for sympathy, honestly I brought this all on myself for being a moron, but if anyone is reading this, late teens/early 20s, don't let life kick you down and wait years to get back up, get back up right now and keep trying. I'm sorry if this isn't a good place to post this and if it's not appropriate the mods can remove it, I just really needed to get my thoughts out there, somewhere, anywhere. Thanks.
