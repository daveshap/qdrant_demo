Implementing a function using decoder, encoder and some gates Implement the function F(A,B,C,D,E) = A\u2019B\u2019C\u2019DE\u2019+ABCD\u2019E using only the components required from the ones given below:One 3:8 decoder with active high outputs and an active high enable inputOne 8:3 Priority Encoder with input no. 7 at highest priority with one active high enable which if disabled forces the outputs to logic lowOne 2 input XOR gateOne 2 input OR gateOne 2 input AND gateMy attempts:I have noticed that the function has the minterms 2 and 29 - 00010and 11101. I can make the decoder have four inputs using an enable pin (for avariable).Drawing the K-Map doesn't seem to simplify anything.Applying De-Morgan's law doesn't seem to simplify things.Tried using B,C and E in the decoder and A or D in the enable. This provides me with 8 minterms of B,C and E.I am stuck on how to implement it using only these.How do I approach this question(and other such design questions) further?
