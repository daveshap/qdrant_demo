MBA/Masters in Business -> Ed.D.
Hello, anyone ever had this career route? Iâ€™m finishing my masters in 2021 and then I got plans for a doctorate. However, not interested in a PhD but instead either an Ed.D. or DBA so that I could teach part time in college. How was the switch and how did the academe accept professional doctorate instead of a PhD? Thanks!
