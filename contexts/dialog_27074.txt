GRAMMS: Valentine had himself a party, I hear.
FIELDING: My client has already given a statement regarding yesterday's events.
GRAMMS: A <u>statement</u>? I wouldn't mind getting a statement. You see, <u>my</u> client -- the United States Government -- would love to get a statement about a few of the deals going down with your client.
FIELDING: Deals? My client is involved in any number of deals at any given moment. You'd have to be more specific.
GRAMMS: Your client have a deal in Long Beach? How about downtown? There's some folks there -- oh, wait, they're all dead. Any of this ring a bell?
FIELDING: My client is an entrepreneur. I am his lawyer, not his business manager.
GRAMMS: So you wouldn't have any idea how your client continues to make so much fucking money.
FIELDING: He's always been very forward-thinking. He invested wisely.
GRAMMS: Where is he now?
FIELDING: He had urgent business in the north.
WILSON: Where's Big Sur?
ELAINE: Up the coast.
WILSON: How far?
ELAINE: I don't know -- few hours, I guess.
WILSON: Fancy it?
ELAINE: I could use a vacation. Of course, I keep forgetting, for you this <u>is</u> a vacation.
WILSON: Never thought of that. Busman's holiday.
ELAINE: What's in Big Sur?
WILSON: That's where Valentine's scarpered.
ELAINE: How do you know?
WILSON: Bloke told me.
