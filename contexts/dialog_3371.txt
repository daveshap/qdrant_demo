EVE: ... Do you think we should look for him?
ALLENBY: I don't think so, he should be along soon...
EVE: I wish he were here...
EVE: We have to find him, Robert - he could be lost, something may have happened, we can't leave him!
ALLENBY: You really care for him, don't you, Eve?
EVE: I do - we do - both of us, Ben and I feel so much for Chauncey...
ALLENBY: I think we'd better go look for him. David!
