Is it okay to just not return a call for phone screening/interview?
I've been testing the water around my area with applications, a lot to places I don't actually care for like retail and fast food and would probably be miserable working at. I've gotten a few calls from these places asking if I could call them back for some questions and stuff. What are the consequences of not doing so? Do I get blacklisted? Will they remember my lack of return call months down the line if I actually need a job there?
