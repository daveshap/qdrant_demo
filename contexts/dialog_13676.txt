AL: I'm trying to get you to listen to reason.
AL: Look! I didn't ask to be in you. Don't blame me for it. You did it.
JOE: Me? What'd I do?
AL: Yeah. What did you do? You explain it. ...why I'm not at the lab right now, in my tube, with my crew. Explain that!
JOE: I don't know what you're talking about.
AL: The Nicholson Node. I suppose you haven't heard of that either.
JOE: No.
AL: You've heard of U.S.T.?
JOE: I just went there for a job.
AL: Then how'd I get here?
