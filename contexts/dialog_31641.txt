XANDER: We're on to the game, ese. You got the fake blood splattered all over the walls, you got your torture tools... It's all very cute. But come on, let's quit while you're ahead. I'm only trying to save you a beatin'.
JEFE: You saving me? You talking pretty tough for a guy got himself chained to the ceiling.
XANDER: Alright. You wanna eat through a tube, be my guest.
JEFE: Now you're gonna make me enjoy this, funny guy. Now I'm gonna take the whole foot off. Whatchu think of that?
