What is the difference between studying Applied Statistics vs Data Science vs Data Analytics vs Business Analytics?
Hello all,

I'm researching for potential graduate study and I was wondering what is the difference between studying Applied Statistics vs Data Science vs Data Analytics vs Business Analytics and which would you advise to choose for someone interested in spreadsheets and data analysis.

Basically quantitative skills that help businesses save costs or increase their revenue.

Background:

Business and currently in digital marketing SEO/SEM. I am also learning SQL in my free time
