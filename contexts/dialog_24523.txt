KELVIN: She knows everything. She knows who she is.
SNOW: She knows everything? Does she know she came once before and you put her in --
KELVIN: No.
SNOW: What do you want?
KELVIN: I want you to get Sartorius to abandon his plan.
SNOW: What plan?
KELVIN: Just get him to stop.
SNOW: What do you want to do, leave the station with her?
KELVIN: Yes.
SNOW: Kelvin, she'll disintegrate. You don't believe me? Let's radio that shuttle pod you launched -- better yet, let's go get it. I've charted it's trajectory, only take a few hours...
KELVIN: Her oxygen would have run out.
SNOW: Maybe she doesn't need any. Should we check?
SNOW: Who are you trying to please? Yourself? Her? Which her, this one or that one. Can you face both? We are in a situation that is beyond morality. So: Leave with her. You'll see the transformation.
KELVIN: Into what?
SNOW: You'll see her die, that's all. They're mortal, despite what she told you. She will die. Then what will you do?
KELVIN: I love her.
SNOW: You do, you don't. She's willing to give her life, you're willing to give yours, it's touching and magnificent, anything you want but -- this isn't the place for it. Don't you see? No, you don't.
