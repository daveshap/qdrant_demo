RAY: Think back, before the suit was filed, before the trial. Lombardo had an affair with Sandra, right? So why not tell us about the affair? I mean it could be a hell of a motive for Kelly to fabricate her charge in the first place.
GLORIA: Maybe Lombardo's attorney was saving the affair for the trial.
RAY: I thought of that. Then I said, come on, you're Lombardo. Your reputation is getting trashed. You want to stop the bleeding. You don't want to sit in jail for three months. Unless...
GLORIA: Unless what?
RAY: Unless you're setting up Sandra Van Ryan for the big payday.
RAY: They chumped us, Gloria, right from the start.
GLORIA: Why? You ask me, Lombardo had it pretty good already, nice job in a beautiful setting, popular, an active social life. He's gonna put this all on the line for some dicey play like what you're describing...
RAY: The job looks okay to us. But look at it from his point of view. The man's surrounded by wealth and privilege. But for him... it's just a reminder of what should have been his.
