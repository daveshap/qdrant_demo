BUD: Mrs. MacDougall, I think it is only fair to warn you that you are now alone with a notorious sexpot.

BUD: Ask anybody around here. As a matter of fact, when it's time for me to go -- and I may go just like that -- -- I have promised my body to the Columbia Medical Center.
MARGIE: Gee. Sort of gives you goose-bumps just to think about it.
BUD: Well, they haven't got me yet, baby. Dig up some ice from the kitchen and let's not waste any time -- preliminary-wise.
MARGIE: I'm with you, lover.
