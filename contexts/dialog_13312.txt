ROSE: My brother says things are going really well between you and Nathan.
LILA: I cannot believe how in love I am with this man.
ROSE: Yeah?
LILA: He's so cute. I even like his cute little penis. It's like a little pig's penis or something. Rose, we connect on every level. I've finally found someone I can feel completely safe with.
ROSE: Don't throw that away. I had that once with a guy. But I threw it away for a cheap thrill.
LILA: One night stand?
ROSE: No. I married a midget.
LILA: Marrying a midget was a cheap thrill?
ROSE: Well he wasn't really a midget. He was on the cusp of midgethood. That's what made it cheap. Had he been an actual midget, there would've been nothing cheap about it, my dear.
LILA: I didn't know you were into that sort of thing.
ROSE: Let me tell you, honey, midgets are the best kept secret in male companionship. They're portable. They're controllable. They're eager. And they're exactly the right height for a little covert oral fun on the dance floor.
LILA: I have a friend you might like to meet.
ROSE: Oh?
LILA: Three foot one.
ROSE: Be still my crotch.
LILA: Rose, Nathan's no midget, but he's asked me to move in with him.
ROSE: Yeah. My brother told me.
LILA: And I think I'm going to.
ROSE: Stand on a stepladder sometimes.
