Creepy Maintenance Man
So I won’t say my real name, but my nickname is Daisy. I’ll give my friends fake names also, to protect them. I am a student in university and I am in accommodation with 4 girls, everything is sort of going well. 

But we’ve really bad problems with this particular maintenance guy, that arrived just after Christmas, he’s very passive aggressive, rude to all 4 of us, and he’s very into special treatment of one girl, my roommate Lana, they’re from the same country and she is studying abroad. 

But it got pretty strange how the first time he came to inspect something, he just decided to sit down with Lana and her friend on the couch and make himself comfortable, and talked about how he used to pick up girls back home. 

It gets worse 

Queue him coming in for things that don’t make sense? We don’t report any problems and he literally just says “Oh I’m here to fix so-so.” But we all talk and we haven’t had any email about something needing to be fixed, and nobody has reported it. 

I remember not that long ago, Lana came in from university, and walked to the kitchen and he was just sat there; his music on full blast and said he was “taking a break because the flat down the hallway had a flood. “ Yep, that’s right, he just entered our flat when nobody was there and made himself comfy! What the fuck? 

We don’t even report any issues or technical problems, and he still comes around. Weird things he does like, leaving flour on our unit on pancake day, TWICE. 

What should I do? my other friends Amelia, and Lucy are the most willing to take action, while my other roommate, Rose who’s hardly ever here doesn’t want to because she’s leaving soon 😒 and Lana, my other roommate is very freaked out also, she’s his main focus, he comes in, let’s himself in JUST TO SEE HER? But she’s from abroad and dealing with a lot, so I don’t want to see her hurt. 

But honestly, I have no idea what this guy is capable of. He has keys to our flat door, our rooms and we’re all out most of the days, so I don’t know what he does do when we’re not here. 😬

Help!
