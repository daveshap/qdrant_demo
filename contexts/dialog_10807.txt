JUDGE: The witness is leading him. Sustained.
LOUIS: Okay, let me rephrase that question. Didn't you once coach a basketball team for underprivileged children?
VENKMAN: Yes, I did. We were city champs.
PROSECUTOR: Objection. Irrelevant and immaterial.
JUDGE: Sustained. Mr. Tully, do you have anything to ask this witness that may have some bearing on this case?
LOUIS: Do I?
