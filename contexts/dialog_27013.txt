THEO: Maybe he never came in. If he'd come in, he would have left his bags at the door, right? Or maybe he got here early, and went for a walk, and fell. Maybe he's outside.
THEO: Is it over?
NELL: No, it's getting worse.
MARROW: Nell! What's wrong?
NELL: That smell... oh, God.
MARROW: What did it smell like?
NELL: It was very specific.
MARROW: All right...
NELL: In the bathroom in my mother's room, the toilet was next to an old wooden table. It smelled like that wood.
MARROW: So... smell... is... Smell is the sense that triggers the most powerful memories. And a memory can trigger a smell.
NELL: I wasn't thinking about my mother's bathroom.
MARROW: What happened after you smelled it?
NELL: I looked at Theo. She had a look on her face.
MARROW: Like she smelled it too?
NELL: Yes.
MARROW: And then what happened?
NELL: I got more scared.
MARROW: Hmm.
NELL: I'm sorry. I'm messing up the study.
MARROW: No you're not. Something moved you. You saw something.
