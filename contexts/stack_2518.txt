Finding the \"square\" bounding boxes of a country I want to find the square bounding boxes that cover a country, of different sizes.First off, I know that they won't really be square, but just going by the numbers they can be said to be.The main challenge I have is I don't know where get the data of the points of the countries and/or the borders.  After that I think I can calculate the boxes by iterating over them.Let's say I want do this for the continental US and with boxes of size 50 (lat, lon), then I can easily do this manually.  The first box (starting from NW) would be [[50, -150], [0, -100]], and the second is [[50, -150], [0, -100]], and I'm done.Now let's say the size is 25, and now the first box is [[50, -125], [25, -100]].  I will end up with more boxes but a more defined area and overall smaller.  I guess another term could be \"search grid\" calculations.Is there any publicly available datasets or APIs that I can use to determine if a bounding box or a point belongs to a country?
