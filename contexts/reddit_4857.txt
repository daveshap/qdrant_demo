I just wanna talk
I'm 20 years old from Sao Paulo, Brazil. I've no friends around here cause I move to here about 2 years ago and after all this time I still making no friends. I've a lot to say, just wanna start a conversation with another people of my age or older. Idk, I think I'm too old for my age you know? I've many doubts about what I'm doing with my life. Maybe I'm little depressed so I think talk will help. 
Anyone?

Thanks a lot.
