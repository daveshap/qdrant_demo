Would you rather take a long commute for a super desirable job or take a satisfactory job within walking distance?
So I recently finished a round of interviews with two that I’m feeling really confident about. I’ve confirmed a tertiary interview with one, and was promised a decision by the end of this week from the other.

The tertiary interview I’m heading for next week is my dream job at this point in my career. I’d be managing an entire department consisting of multiple teams — it’s a big jump from the quasi-managerial roles I’ve had previously, the office environment is amazing, they’re in a big growth mode — everything about it is extremely exciting. But I don’t have a car and public transportation in my area is lacking, so it’s a bitch to get to considering it’s out in the suburbs.

The other I’m hoping for an offer from is a quick, free city bus ride away, or I could even walk there if I really wanted to... but it’s more of a lateral move, the company is in a niche industry and not expanding much, but the office is still a very cool environment, so I feel like I’d be happy there.

So, I’m curious what this sub has to say — would you rather take a really good job that’s a bitch to get to, or wipe out the commute for something less enticing?

EDIT: After reading the responses, I’m realizing I’d rather take the commute for the career jump. Commutes don’t bother me, work is life at this stage, and I’ll kick myself if I turn it down for a job I’m a lot less excited about just because I didn’t want to travel as far. Thank you all for your input, and let’s hope I get that offer to start off the new year!
