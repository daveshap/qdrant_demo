Required free Disk Space for Index rebuild offline Operations I have SQL Server 2017 Standard Editon with two Databases. The current total index size of Database1 is 111 GB and for Database2 is 122 GB. Since I'm on Standard Edition I can only rebuild the Index offline.  We have split the Database-Files on Disk D: and Log-Files on E:. Free disk space on D: is 290 GB and on E: 35 GB. How can I calculate the required free disk space for offline index rebuild on D: and E:? For online Index rebuilds, I've found a Microsoft article stating that total space required is approximately 1.2 times the total index size. Is the same estimate true for offline rebuilds?  Do I need this free disk space for Database-Files and for Log-Files?
