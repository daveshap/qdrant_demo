I really regret not just shooting my shot
I (25f) used to go the gym almost every day before everything shut down. I’d often see this cute guy there, and I’m pretty sure that I saw him checking me out sometimes too. Plus one time he was talking to his friend near me (I swear I wasn’t trying to eavesdrop!) and from what they were saying, it sounded like he was single.

I tried to work up the courage to talk to him, but I always chickened out. I go to a climbing gym, so people are generally friendly and it’s common for people to strike up conversations with strangers. And I reminded myself that there was no pressure because I could start out friendly and just see how we vibe. Yet I’d still get too scared to do it! It felt like I had an unlimited amount of time, so I always told myself, I’ll do it tomorrow, I’ll do it next week, the timing isn’t right yet. This went on for months. 

And now everything’s shut down. Nobody knows when things will open. Nobody knows what’s going to happen. When things do begin to open again, gyms will be the last to open. I don’t even have his number or anything to contact him another way. Idk when I’ll see him again, and idk if he’ll even still be single by then. I wish I could tell my past self not to take those opportunities to talk to him for granted!! 

When things start to open up again, I want to make dating more of a priority. I know that there are lots of wonderful men out there that I’ll be excited to meet. But I can’t help but feel a bit of regret for not knowing how things could have turned out. 

Idk why I’m writing this except to vent. Also to remind everyone out there - especially my fellow ladies - to not wait around and just take your chance! I know I’ll be better about it from now on.
