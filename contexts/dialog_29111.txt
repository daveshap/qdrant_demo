BOND: Paris?!? What are you doing here?
PARIS: Is that any way to say hello?
BOND: I thought your specialty was good-bye.
PARIS: Oh, James. I've missed you -
BOND: Is this another one of your games?
PARIS: Stop it! You're hurting me! Can't you just be nice?
BOND: I've got half the British government breathing down my neck. I don't have time for your nonsense.
PARIS: Don't you even miss me? Didn't I mean anything to you?
BOND: Nothing.
BOND: What about Elliot Harmsway? Or is this just another one of your stunts?
PARIS: No! He's crazy - he's insane. He hates everybody. He's got these plans - You've got to help me, James. I'm sorry. I'm sorry for everything. I know I was wrong - but you've got to protect me. I know you still love -
PARIS: Do you feel better now?
BOND: Do you?
BOND: What about the uranium?
PARIS: It's on the boat. He's holding a press conference tomorrow.
PARIS: I'm so sorry, James. I promise, I'll never leave you again.
BOND: Shhhhh...
PARIS: Just hold me.
