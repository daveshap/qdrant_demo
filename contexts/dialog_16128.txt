BOB: Mr. Stevens?
GEORGE: I've been dreading you.
BOB: Bob Larson. Do you happen to have an unenclosed toilet in close proximity to a kitchen?
GEORGE: A violation?
BOB: Oh, yes.
GEORGE: And if I enclosed it?
BOB: An exhaust system or a window is code.
GEORGE: A sink?
BOB: Allowed outside the enclosed area.
SAM: Where is it?
GEORGE: A friend of yours is here.
SAM: Did you got through my pants?
GEORGE: I might have a solution.
