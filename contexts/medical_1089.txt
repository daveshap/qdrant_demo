Cardioversion - Unsuccessful, REASON FOR EXAM:, Atrial flutter/cardioversion.,PROCEDURE IN DETAIL:, The procedure was explained to the patient with risks and benefits. The patient agreed and signed the consent form. The patient received sedation prior to the cardioversion with a transesophageal echo as dictated earlier with a total of 50 mcg of fentanyl and 6 mg of Versed. The pads were applied in the anterior-posterior approach. The synchronized cardioversion with biphasic energy delivered at 150 J. First attempt was unsuccessful. Second attempt at 200 J with anterior-posterior approach. With biphasic synchronized energy delivered was also unsuccessful with degeneration of the atrial flutter into atrial fibrillation.,The patient was decided to be on wave control and amiodarone and reattempted cardioversion after anticoagulation for four to six weeks and because of the reduced LV function, the success of the rate without antiarrhythmic may be low.,IMPRESSION:, Unsuccessful direct current cardioversion with permanent atrial fibrillation.surgery, atrial flutter, cardioversion, anterior-posterior, transesophageal, atrial fibrillation, flutter/cardioversion, fibrillation, atrial,
