MS. HELLER: That's great, now make a left, then straight!
MARGIE: Oh, yeah he was straight all right, just wasn't very good in the sack. I used to give him directions. Higher, lower, faster, harder, small circles, do the alphabet. Useless.
MS. HELLER: Left here! Left!
MARGIE: You bet I left him, took the dog and we was history.
MS. HELLER: Ha! Too big to make the turn!
MARGIE: No, it actually fit quite nicely. Well, except for the fact that it wasn't really as long as it was wide.
MS. HELLER: I think you did it.
MARGIE: Damn right I did it. Went back and set the house on fire, his little floozy testified in court - and I ended up doing ten years at Rikers, got my teeth knocked out by Mike the Dyke.
MS. HELLER: What the hell are you talking about?
