MITCH: You look a little shaken.
MELANIE: I... I am. Mitch, is... Mitch, this isn't usual, is it? The gull yesterday when I was in the boat, and the one last night at Annie's, and now...
MITCH: Last night? What do you mean?
MELANIE: A gull smashed into Annie's front door. Mitch... what's happening?
MITCH: I don't know, Melanie. Look, do you have to go back to Annie's?
MELANIE: No, I have my things in the car.
MITCH: Then stay and have something to eat before you start back. I'd feel a lot better.
MITCH: Do you want some mustard with this?
MELANIE: No, thank you.
CATHY: Why didn't Annie stay for dinner?
MITCH: She said something about having to get home to take a call from her mother back East.
CATHY: Oh. Where d'you want the coffee?
MITCH: Take it into the living room, would you, hon?
CATHY: What's the matter with them?
