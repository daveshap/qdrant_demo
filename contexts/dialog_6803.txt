ERIC: A year ago. Halloween. A man and a woman. In a loft. You helped to murder them.
TIN-TIN: Last Halloween, eh? Yeah... Yeah, I remember. I fucked her too, I think.
ERIC: You cut her. You raped her. You watched!
TIN-TIN: Hey, I got my rocks off, so fuck you in the ass, man.
ERIC: I want you to tell me a story, Tin-Tin.
TIN-TIN: I don't know you...
TIN-TIN: Holy shit... you're dead, man...
ERIC: Victims. Aren't we all.
