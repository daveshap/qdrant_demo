3 phase 12 V step down transformer I need a 3 phase power supply for Lab purpose. Since using 220 V x 3 phase is dangerous, I'm searching for a three phase step down transformer and that seems not available. Am I asking something which is not commonly used?Input : 3 phase, RYB, 220 V ACOutput : 3 phase, RYB, 12 V ACI'm looking for a transformer just like the power companies do - 11 kV to 220 V, 3 phase - similar transformer from 220 VAC to 12 VAC, 3 phase.Any directions? Pros / Cons - why not available easily, any references?
