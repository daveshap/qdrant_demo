Anyone else lonely at this lockdown time? COVID-19
Been single for a few months. I wanted this year to be my year of dating and meeting new people. I was off to a decent start but then COVID happened. The relationships I built prior seem to he dying a bit. There is only so much you can text a person without seeing them.


All this makes me miss my ex even more.
