ALEX: Good evening, sir.
MR. ALEXANDER: Good evening.
ALEX: It was very kind of you to leave this out for me, sir. There was no-one around when I finished my bath, so I started. I hope that's alright, sir.
MR. ALEXANDER: Of course. Food alright?
ALEX: Great, sir. Great.
MR. ALEXANDER: Try the wine!
ALEX: Thank you very much, sir. Cheers Suddenly the thought occurs to Alex that the wine may be drugged or poisoned.
ALEX: Won't you join me, sir?
MR. ALEXANDER: No, my health doesn't allow it.
ALEX: And you, sir?
