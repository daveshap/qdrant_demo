CONWAY: Where did you come from?
LOVETT: I'm Alexander P. Lovett, sir.
CONWAY: Why aren't you registered through our office?
GEORGE: It would serve you right if you were left behind.
LOVETT: How could I know that a war was going to break out right over my head! Right over my head. Oh, my word! I tell you, those Chinese were pouncing on me from every direction. I had to get into these ridiculous clothes in order to escape.
CONWAY: Where were you hiding?
LOVETT: Hiding? Oh, no. Hunting - I was in the interior - hunting fossils. This morning I looked up suddenlyâ€”
CONWAY: I know - and a war broke out right over your head.
GEORGE: The next time you're in wild country like this, keep in touch with the British Consul.
CONWAY: Aha - very good, Freshie.[3] Very good. You'd better put his name on the list and make out a report later.
BARNARD: I beg your pardon, brother. What did you say you were hunting?
LOVETT: Fossils.
BARNARD: Fossils, huh?
LOVETT: I'm a paleontologist.
BARNARD: A what?
LOVETT: A paleontologist.
BARNARD: Oh, I see.
LOVETT: I have here a discovery that will startle the world. It's the vertebrae from the lumbar of a Megatherium,[4] found in Asia.
BARNARD: Well, what do you know about that!
LOVETT: Found in Asia!
BARNARD: Uh-huh.
LOVETT: When I get home I shall probably be knighted for it.
BARNARD: Knighted! You don't say. Do you mind if I take a look at it?
LOVETT: Not at all.
BARNARD: Sorry.
LOVETT: This is the only thing I was able to save when those heathens surrounded me.
BARNARD: Uh-huh.
LOVETT: You see, from this vertebrae I shall be able to reconstruct the entire skeleton.
BARNARD: Wait a minute, you expect to be knighted for finding that soupbone?
LOVETT: It was the vertebrae of a Megatherium - found in Asia.
BARNARD: Yeah, I remember. You said that before.
LOVETT: Sir Henry Derwent was knighted, and he never got beyond the mesozoic era.
