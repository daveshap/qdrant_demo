BOOTH: You're crazy.
EARL: How badly do you want that money?! How bad do you want to stay out of jail?
BOOTH: Not bad enough to kill him.
EARL: Who said anything about killing? Just keep driving straight...
WALLACE: Mr. Curtis called us this afternoon. The bills arrived at this branch from a cash drop. Came through a store called After Midnight. There's only four employees, none of them can tell us who passed them.
DWAYNE: Is this marked money, or what?
WALLACE: Some of it. Denning only handled a small portion of the total, but it looks like this was one of his bills.
DWAYNE: So there was money there! Who the hell's money is it?!
MARTIN: We don't know. Whoever got this payload together has one hell of a laundering system.
DWAYNE: Have you known this all along?
MARTIN: Well you can understand why we didn't say anything. If word got out that we had a track on the money it would only work against us.
DWAYNE: Well yes I understand that, we don't want them high-tailing it out of here.
MARTIN: Sheriff Hogan --
DWAYNE: Dwayne.
MARTIN: Dwayne... It is imperative that we keep this confidential.	Now we know someone's out there. Very close. It may even be the son of a bitch that killed my partner.
DWAYNE: Fine. The information doesn't leave this room.
