ANTHONY: Bob, where you going?
BOB: I'm not playing any more golf.
ANTHONY: Why not?
BOB: Cause I'm not getting any better. It's a waste of time.
ANTHONY: You've only been playing for two weeks, Bob. It takes a long time to learn this game.
BOB: You think I'm improving?
ANTHONY: Yes. You just got to stick with it.
BOB: You don't have to talk about it if you don't want to.
ANTHONY: No, I don't mind.
BOB: I know it must of been a bad experience. But it doesn't sound like it was your fault.
ANTHONY: Well, I didn't mean to electrocute him. But the whole operation was my idea.
ANTHONY: It took six months of research. I did all the wiring myself. Switched AC to DC. Doubled the voltage. Shorted out the generator. The whole school was shut down.
BOB: That's pretty complicated for a senior prank.
ANTHONY: I don't like that word prank, Bob. I was trying to do something more than a prank.
