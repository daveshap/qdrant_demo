DR. THURMAN: Your mother said that you've been skipping cycles of your medication.
DONNIE: I've been taking it. I just like to make her feel guilty for all of this. You know, abuse her. Psychologically.
DR. THURMAN: All of this... certainly isn't your mother's fault, Donald.
DONNIE: So, I met a new friend.
DR. THURMAN: Would you like to talk about this friend?
DONNIE: His name is Frank.
DR. THURMAN: Frank.
DONNIE: I think he saved my life.
DR. THURMAN: How so?
DONNIE: Don't you watch the news?
DR. THURMAN: I don't own a television.
DONNIE: A jet engine fell on my house... landed on my bed. While I was talking to Frank on the golf course.
