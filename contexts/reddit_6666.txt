How to deal with recruiters?
TLDR: Is it bad to go around an external recruiter and apply for a position at a company directly?

Hi all, new to this sub. Looks like a good one to watch from here on, but came here specifically with the following question:

I've started looking for a new job recently and have started getting a lot of emails/Linkedin messages from recruiters. Not company recruiters, but recruiters that work for a recruiting company if that makes sense. Most of the offers so far are way off and don't at all pertain to me. I have just been replying with a polite I'm not interested right now, but will keep you in mind in the future type of message.

However, I have had some that are offering what I'm looking for. One in particular works for a recruitment company, but based on their linkedin profile seems to be tied with the company that she is offering positions for. This company is a big well known company that I would be thrilled to get a job for. I'm following through with the recruiter for the position that they brought to my attention, but there are numerous other positions on that company's website that would fit with me. Should I keep with the recruiter for those as well and just tell them I am applying for the other positions? Does going through a recruiter hurt your chances of getting a job?
