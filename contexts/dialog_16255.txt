HATCHET: I like your bar.

HATCHET: I want your bar.

HATCHET: Do you want me to draw a picture?

HATCHET: What, and I care? Remember, you do have the luxurious advantage of being able to sustain your son's life.
JD: And you do have a reputation, so I'll choose my words carefully. But not to put too fine a point on it, fuck yourself, Harry!
