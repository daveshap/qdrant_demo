FLOYD: Thank you.
PILOT: Incidentally, Dr. Floyd, I wonder if I can have a word with you about the security arrangements?
FLOYD: What do you mean?
PILOT: Well... the crew is confined to the ship when we land at Clavius. We have to stay inside for the time it take to refit - about twenty-four hours. And then we're going to back empty.
FLOYD: I see.
PILOT: I take it this is something to do with the trouble they're having up at Clavius?
