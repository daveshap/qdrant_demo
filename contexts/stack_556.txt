What are the differences between mod-wsgi and libapache2-mod-wsgi-py3? I am learning about virtual hosting. I have a Django project and need WSGI module. Reading multiple tutorials, I see that people install different packages of mod-wsgi, for example mod-wsgi and libapache2-mod-wsgi-py3. What are differences among them?Where should I read to know the differences of these similar packages? How do I choose one over another?
