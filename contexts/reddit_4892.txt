What do I do when I feel like I'm not getting any better?
Lately I've been having a depressive episode. I've been getting help for the past 4 years or so, I thought I had found a medication set to help control things a little better, my therapist seems helpful, but I honestly feel like everything is only a temporary fix and that I'm not actually getting better despite taking every step I can think of to work towards feeling better.
