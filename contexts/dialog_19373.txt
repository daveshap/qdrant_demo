DELIVERY GUY: Delivery!
CRAIG: Hold on.
DELIVERY GUY: Delivery!
CRAIG: I said hold on!
DELIVERY GUY: Could you hurry up, please... it's kinda hot out here.
CRAIG: Can I help you?
DELIVERY GUY: Nice house. Didn't expect you to answer. You must be one of those entertainers. What team you play for?
CRAIG: I don't play for no team.
DELIVERY GUY: Come on, jerky, you can tell me. Got a white wife, huh? Blonde bombshell type. Remember what happen to O.J... what team do you play for? You're not related to the Jacksons, are you?
CRAIG: Naw, I play for the Chocamunga Cracker Killers. You want tickets?
DELIVERY GUY: Okay, buddy. Don't send your entourage out here to do a 187 on me. It's just a certified mail delivery.
CRAIG: What is it?
DELIVERY GUY: Delinquent Property Tax Notice... I hope the Cracker Killers pay well 'cause if not, back to the ghetto you go. Wife stays here, of course.
