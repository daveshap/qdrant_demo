DAWN: OK...it's open.
TAYLOR: Seen one like it before?
DAWN: Sure. It complies with all standard construction codes.
TAYLOR: Great.
TAYLOR: Mac, I have a favor to ask you. Mac looks at Taylor -
MAC: Certainly. If you need anything, please feel free to ask me. Just a reminder we have fabulous cuisine available --
TAYLOR: Yes I know all that. Mac, I need you to help us out with a little technical problem.
MAC: Certainly. I have a full working knowledge of the ships operations.
TAYLOR: Right, I understand that...
TAYLOR: I need you to actually do something for me. I need to access your CPU, directly.
MAC: That will not be necessary. You can simply speak to me. I understand most languages fluently.
TAYLOR: Yeah but the ship's mainframe doesn't. I need you to tell it something.
MAC: Alteration of my central processing unit should be done only by an authorized service dealer.
TAYLOR: I know but we're in a bind.
