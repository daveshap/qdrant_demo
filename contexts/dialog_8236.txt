CLIFTON: Uxoriousness - that's my favorite kind of love. Excessive love of one's wife.
ALM√ÅSY: There you have me.
THE PATIENT: What was all the banging? Were you fighting rats or the entire German army?
HANA: I was repairing the stairs. I found a library and the books were very useful.
THE PATIENT: Before you find too many uses for these books would you read some to me?
HANA: I think they're all in Italian, but I'll look, yes. What about your own book?
THE PATIENT: My book? The Herodotus? Yes, we can read him.
HANA: Oh - I've found plums. We have plums in the orchard. We have an orchard! She has peeled a plum and now slips it into his mouth.
THE PATIENT: Thank you.
