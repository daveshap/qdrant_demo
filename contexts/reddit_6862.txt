am i getting laid off?
last saturday i had an accident, and fell. it was a hard fall and i bruised my body up pretty good (busted lip, swollen nose, etc). so they gave me two weeks from work. last sunday i let my work know and sent them the doctors note which has a return date on it.

i got a text message from my boss today asking if I was available for a call later, she also included the HR guy in the text. i gave them all the info they needed, so i have a feeling this call is going to lay me off. before i went on leave i saw a "private meeting" on the calendar. because of covid i've had to setup other meetings regarding different employees' roles. i've seen the unemployment letters stack up, and  i've seen the number of paychecks get smaller and smaller every two weeks.

should i be concerned that i may be laid off (or furloughed)? i feel like since i haven't been in for the last week they've had time to assess whether or not my role is needed. the last time that someone was sick and had to take time off did get laid off.
