BRIAN: My God, an actual operating 8-track.
STEPHEN: What, you've never seen one before?
BRIAN: In the Field Museum once.
STEPHEN: It works.
BRIAN: It worked when you were in sixth grade.
STEPHEN: People actually used to pay you for this?
BRIAN: Millions, Stephen -- And sexual favors.
STEPHEN: Sheep don't count.
BRIAN: Yeah? What about Laura --
STEPHEN: That was never proved.
STEPHEN: Why'd you come here, Brian?
BRIAN: I wanted to know why you messed with my station assignment. I mean, is this really gonna have to one of those big brother -- little brother you broke my GI Joe and I'm still pissed" games?"
STEPHEN: What is it with you, man, huh? How do you manage to keep coming up with new and amazing ways to screw up? That scotch bullshit? Am I really supposed to believe you came crawling back home because you suddenly felt heart strings moan for the family biz? You were bankrupt, man.
BRIAN: Hey! You don't know me --
STEPHEN: I know you cold, Brian. The scary thing is, you probably could have faked it for awhile. But you see, in this job there's no place to hide. Isn't like selling log cabins. You have a bad day here -- someone dies. And that's not fucking good enough. Want another beer?
BRIAN: So that's it? Big bad brother's gonna ride my ass till I cough blood?
STEPHEN: Big bad brother is going to treat you like any other probie -- that I don't think is going to make it.
BRIAN: There's only so much technology can do. Thanks for the beer.
STEPHEN: Thanks for the speakers.
BRIAN: Y'know, I told myself a million times I didn't want to be a fireman. I said bullshit to that line about tradition and family legacy. I know I split, and I know how you felt...
STEPHEN: Yeah, you know. You know what it felt like.
BRIAN: I gotta do this, Stephen. I gotta know.
STEPHEN: I think you're gonna find out, Brian. Don't be late tomorrow.
