Told my partner I'm suicidal
He took it well. He didn't act like I'm the burden I feel like. He said we'd get me help. 

I expected abandonment. I expected dismissal. Instead I got love and support. It would probably feel good, if I could feel anything right now.

If you are also suffering, I hope you find something similar to help you through the tough times
