Made redundant, help!
Hey all,

I’ve been made redundant from my job this week, along with 4 colleagues, including my boss, after being there for only 7 months. It’s due to a team restructure, and they’ve offered roles unrelated to my skills or pay grade (basically the equivalent of offering a Manager/Officer an Assistant job) as an alternative. My other option is I take a redundancy payout of a month’s pay, and go back to contract work until I find something else permanent. 

I’d been finding it a toxic environment for a while (no development opportunities, lack of training and support from my boss, no objectives, high staff turnover, really cliquey), so I’m wondering if I just see it as an opportunity to leave instead of settling for an unrelated position that could make me even less happy, and focus on finding something else that allows me to thrive and use my knowledge? My worry is not finding something quickly, sometimes it’s better to jobhunt whilst in a job - and paying my rent! But I’m quite experienced in my field (marketing), have lots of recruitment contacts and previously contracted/freelanced for 2 years - incidentally, after being made redundant somewhere else. They’ve given us a week to decide - it’s all out of the blue so I’m still processing. Any advice?
