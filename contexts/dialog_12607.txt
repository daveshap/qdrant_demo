ROB: You used to care more about things like Marvin Gaye than you do now. When I first met you, and I made you that tape, you loved it. You said -- and I quote -- It was so good it made you ashamed of your record collection.""
LAURA: Well, I liked you. You were a deejay, and I thought you were hot, and I didn't have a boyfriend, and I wanted one.
ROB: So you weren't interested in music at all?
LAURA: Yeah, sure. More so then than I am now. That's life though, isn't it?
ROB: But Laura... that's me. That's all there is to me. There isn't anything else. If you've lost interest in that, you've lost interest in everything.
LAURA: You really believe that?
ROB: Yes. Look at me. Look at our -- the apartment. What else do I have, other than records and CDs?
LAURA: And do you like it that way?
ROB: Not really.
