ORDELL: Who's paging you?
JACKIE: Ray, the A.T.F. guy.
ORDELL: That works on my nerves, you bein' so buddy-buddy with him.
JACKIE: If I wasn't, this wouldn't work. Now once I deliver I'll have to trust you.
ORDELL: Well, I've been trusting you all this time, haven't I? We agreed on ten percent of what you bring in and that's what you gonna get.
JACKIE: And a hundred thousand if I go to jail.
ORDELL: We're partners, Baby, sorta. I ain't gonna screw you. You haven't told me where I put it for you.
JACKIE: Give it to the bail bondsman, Max Cherry. He'll take care of it.
ORDELL: Max Cherry? You and him friends now? You tell him about this shit?
JACKIE: He won't know where the money came from. Only that it's money.
