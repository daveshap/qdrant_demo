Any Advice for a CCAT?
I’m in the running for a Sales Specialist position at a decently well-known company. I feel like I really crushed the first phone interview, the recruiter said he was going to pass me along to the next round before I could even try to “close” him. 

Part of the next step is having to take a CCAT, a cognitive assessment standardized test. I feel like I’m a decently smart guy, a great communicator, but I am nervous about standardized testing. I haven’t done a test since high school and I didn’t exactly excel.

Has anyone else had to take one of these? Any advice? I know I can nail the verbal and language stuff, but my math and spatial reasoning needs some work but I feel like those aren’t as imperative to sailed.
