Connecting an Arduino to Raspberry Pi I'm trying to connect an arduino with 3 sg92r servo motors on it and an RPI with and lcd and the serial of the arduino connected to it.They are both connected to a power supply with 9v/1A and 5v/2.5A for arduino and rpi respectively. Is this possible?or can I just connect the arduino to the rpi without connecting the arduino to the power supply?
