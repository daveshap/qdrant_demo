Tips on how to ease into first job
I just got my first offer for a job related to my degree and I'm really excited! I'm still thinking about my decision, but I'll most likely say yes to it. I'm nervous about going into a job for the first time and not messing up. My boss says I'll be shadowing and doing training for a bit before I do stuff on my own so that helps me relax a little bit. What advice do you guys have on calming your nerves when taking on a new job?
