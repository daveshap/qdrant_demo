Overqualified but can't find a permanent job for over a year - DMV
I am almost at my wits end looking for a job. I graduated from law school about a year and a half ago and I have my MA and BA before that. I am in the government/policy end of the law and have been working in policy for over 10 years. That is what my coursework, internships, and jobs in between school have all been focused in and around. 

Since graduating law school I have had three temporary positions, with the last one ending in February. I am getting lots of interview requests and making it to some final rounds but still, no one is biting to actually give me a real permanent position. 

I know I am qualified and can do the roles I am applying for but I cannot seem to land a job. I am so frustrated and dejected. I just don't know what to do anymore. I've worked so hard to get where I am but I can't even get jobs that are basic admin positions. I'm at a complete loss. Any and all advice would be helpful. I'm truly so so lost now.
