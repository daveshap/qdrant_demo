DOYLE: We don't have a goddamn band! Y'all just shut the fuck up! We don't need no practicin' or managers cause we ain't no fuckin' band! Morris ain't no genius and the rest of you are just losers. Am I the only one sane human bein' around here? Just get the hell out of my house and don't come back!
VAUGHAN: It's not your house, Doyle, it's Linda's.
DOYLE: I'll kill you, you fuckin' faggot! You mind your own business. Now get out! Now, before I get too mad to turn back.
