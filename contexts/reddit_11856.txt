My classmate from secondary school just announced she's pregnant. Why does it bother me? I don't even want to have children
Maybe I simply envy the fact that she's married and I have never had a BF in my life, and at this point in life, I'd like to know what's like being with someone in a committed relationship? I have never had a relationship of any kind.

Nor FWA or being in more than 5 dates.

Why does it bother me?
