NUKE: This is from Tony for the rainout. C'mon, man, let's go to the party.
CRASH: Naw...
NUKE: Naw"? There's ice skaters coming! You ever made love to an ice skater?"
CRASH: By the dozen. Holiday on Ice, Ice Capades, Ice Follies-- I'm through with one night stands.
NUKE: You're through with one night stands?! What do you want?
CRASH: I just wanta play everyday despite small nagging injuries--and go home to a woman who appreciates how full of crap I truly am.
NUKE: You're weird, man--I want a ice skater real bad.
CRASH: Go for it.
NUKE: If I get laid, you won't tell Annie?
CRASH: I won't have to.
