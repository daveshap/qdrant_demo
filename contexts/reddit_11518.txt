2008 - My and my son's year from hell - Getting it off my chest
I want to write about the worst year of my life. Nobody has heard the full story, just bits and pieces.

&#x200B;

I feel like I've never recovered. I never had a friend to just say, "You'll never guess what happened today," as each thing unfolded. That small thing would have helped so much. This is really, REALLY long and if anyone reads the whole thing, I will be VERY surprised (but grateful). (Honestly, I'm pretty new to Reddit, but I am guessing few posts on here are as long as this one.)

&#x200B;

I know many people have had far worse things happen, and I try to keep this all in perspective. It's not that I think this is terrible compared to some true horror stories I've heard, just that I never had someone to just say basically, "You'll never guess what happened today."

&#x200B;

So, this was in 2008 (hard to believe it is now 11 years ago, my life since then has been like a dream).

&#x200B;

In 2008:

&#x200B;

\+ My Mom died

\+ I split with my now ex-husband a couple of weeks later.

&#x200B;

Those are the highlights, but just the highlights.

&#x200B;

In January, my Mom died a gracious death. She was 80. It wasn't tragic in and of itself, given her age. But she was my Mom and the hub of the family. I worried greatly about my Dad. They had been married almost 60 years.

&#x200B;

My ex-husband said to me a week after her death, "It's been a week. When are you going to stop being sad?" (One week! 3 days after the funeral.) Due to a variety of factors (certainly not just that), I told him I wanted a divorce a few weeks after her death. He moved out 6 weeks after her death. I could have handled her death fine. (I would have been sad, but it would have been a good, clean sad.) But he was such a jerk about the whole thing and the miserable years that preceeded it haunted me such that every time I thought about my Mom, I thought about him. Every time I thought about him, I thought about my Mom. It was a lot.

&#x200B;

Two months after my Mom died, my son got into a car accident the same day my Dad was rushed to the hospital with heart trouble. My Dad was very fit. Doctors said he was as fit as most 40 year olds (golf, bowling, walked 2 miles 6 days a week, table tennis). But he had blockage of an artery, and we were all terrified that we would lose our Dad two months after losing our Mom. 

&#x200B;

While in the hospital, my brother and I apparently failed to send enough status updates to our oldest sister who got upset and sent an email in which she said, "I don't know if you realize this, but my Mom just died...." HER Mom. Not "our Mom". She's not my favorite person but I was upset when she almost died that year.

&#x200B;

My son had a girlfriend  that year, his first girlfriend who he really loved. Right around the same time, he found out she had been cheating on him with his best friend (since 3rd grade) and over 14 other guys. Due to his accident, he couldn't work at his job. He lost his step-Dad (only Dad he'd ever known), his Grandma (he was closer to her than I was), all the in-laws on step-Dad's side, his job, his girlfriend, and his best and one of only two guy friends. Not being able to work due to the injuries, he stopped driving in the car he'd purchased which he loved to do. (He wouldn't take money from me.). So, he sat in his room and played WOW, his life very suddenly changed. He became quite depressed very suddenly.

&#x200B;

When my son first found out, he didn't dump her immediately. Being an analytical person, he talked to her, tried to figure out her mindset and what was going on. They came and talked to me about all this (uncomfortably for me, but I'm glad they felt comfortable). She broke down and said she's been molested as a child and had known she needed help for a couple of years. It ended up that she asked me to beg her Mom to let her got to counselling. Her Mom wouldn't let her go! So, for 2 hours a night for at least 6 days, I agonized writing a letter to her parents. I have Asperger's and so being diplomatic is of course not my strong suit. I finished the letter, and both of them read and approved it, and the parents read it. The Mom said, "If she needs someone to talk to, she can talk to me," which of course the poor girl didn't do, because her Mom was terrifying. I hate to say it, but pulling the strength in to try write that god damned letter in such a way to actually help that kid took all my strength with everything going on, and it did no good :-( I worked so hard on that letter. (I hear she's doing pretty good now, though!)

&#x200B;

Then someone broke into my son's car twice that year, the second time stealing everything (both times breaking a window). He wouldn't let me help. (He's very stubborn.)

&#x200B;

He had left a GPS, his ipod, and his phone in his car. He was normally very careful, but there had been a weird circumstance and he'd gotten knocked off his habit and left them. They were all stolen. He had paid for all this himself.

&#x200B;

I have three sisters. During that year, all three went to the hospital, near death. One was in intensive care at the same time my Mom was being moved to hospice. I could write 4 more paragraphs about what happened to them that year!

&#x200B;

Right at the beginning of the year, the 3rd oldest sister had just driven home with her husband and 6 kids (one 3yo and 2 4yos, one adopted) to an island off the east coast of the US and was actually almost home when she got the news about my Mom failing. This sister left the husband and oldest daughter and drove all the way back to Minnesota with the 5 kids (alone). She was completely exhausted and stressed when she arrived back in MN. 

&#x200B;

She home-schooled the youngest 3 and did NOT isolated them from other kids, so she was a very busy women every day. Very "strong". After my Mom died, after she drove back across the country to her home (with 5 kids!), she couldn't cope for the first time in her life. At one point, she told us she was talking to someone at her church and suddenly laid down in the hallway and started sobbing. I almost never saw her cry as a kid.

&#x200B;

So, I was worried about her, and was calling her frequently, trying to talk to her. Her husband was in the military. She was used to being almost a single Mom, but she really needed someone. Her husband worked maybe 60 hours per week. Then she almost died due to a stomach thing (I can't even remember what it was) later in the year.

&#x200B;

My brother's son has ADHD and Asperger's. He had been on medicine that gave him a twitch, so they took him off around when my Mom died. He started being unable to get himself to school. He'd wake up, shower, dress, then sit on the floor and say, "I can't go. I just can't go." It was maybe withdrawal from the medicine. The school called the authorities, and my brother and sister-in-law almost had to go to court. They were calling counsellors and doing everything they could, but we were afraid for a while for his sake and that they might be charged with a crime.

&#x200B;

My 2nd sister's boyfriend of 10 years was also a jerk after my mother died. A week after her death, my sister still had flowers from the funeral in her place. He told her she had to get rid of them because it made HIM feel too sad about my mother's death. My sister broke up with him. 

&#x200B;

Around that time, they had found out he had pancreatic cancer. We knew and loved him like a brother-in-law. My son knew him well. My sister broke up with him, but we didn't wish him any ill will. So, my sister got a message that he was "nearing his end" and wanted to "spend his last days" with his ex-wife. A bunch of things ensued and it turns out, he was completely cured, was NOT nearing the end of his life, and that he had been cheating on my sister with his ex-wife for the entire 10 years (with the ex-wife's knowledge). My sister had played cards with the woman! And this guy had been using my sister AND MY PARENTS for money and to fix his car the entire time. This altough my sister never made much and my Dad never made more than $12/hr in his life. (My Dad, in his 70s and 80s had fixed this guy's car for free \~3 times. The guy still owed my parents a couple of thousand dollars, which he never paid to this day.)

&#x200B;

Later in the year, I learned my son's now ex-girlfriend would not leave him alone. Called him all the time, had her friends contact him on FB (after he'd blockd her). He finally had had enough and threw a phone and I stepped in and called her Dad, but this was really hard on him. She called him again one last time and that time, he went a little crazy and said he'd kill himself if she didn't leave him alone. The girlfriend called 911 (as she should have), but I got a call at work saying my son had tried to kill himself. Worst moment of my life. 

&#x200B;

I'll never forget that feeling. He was fine. He was honestly just really pissed. But the terror I felt can not be explained. I should have helped him much earlier in dealing with that situation! Yet another thing to kick myself for that year of many failures on my part. The poor kid. I'm writing this as if this is MY bad year, but why it was my bad year was because it was an incredibly terrible year for all the people I love, and most of all I think of my son. And how I dealt with all of my inability to handle being so worried about him and everyone actually resulted in my doing something that harmed him more than anything, as you will read below!

&#x200B;

I had spoken with the my son and his girlfriend earlier in the year when my son found out what she'd been doing. They actually sat me down and said she'd been having sex with all these guys. I felt really not up to the task of this event!

&#x200B;

My son's car was broken into a third time. This time, the busted his back seat and broke his trunk lock and stole his subwoofer he had bought and did other damage. The car was totalled. (I might be getting some details mixed up. It was a crazy year and it was broken into three times in our driveway.)

&#x200B;

My soon-to-be-ex-husband's Grandma died that year. She was one of my favorite people. I adored her since I met her. I didn't go to the funeral since we were separated, but sent flowers, a hand-written card, and a couple hundred dollars. I wished I could have gone, but I knew it wouldn't be appropriate, of course. His family (who I adored) sent back a note that in flowery terms basically said, "It's the way of the world that people part ways. We don't expect to hear from you again." It made me sad. I wished I could have kept HIS family instead of my own when we divorced. My son called his parents Grandma and Grandpa, and he never got a chance to even say "So long". It was just "Blurt!" that's it, they are no longer part of your life, kid! No good-byes, no nothing for him.

&#x200B;

My now-ex-husband swore up and down he'd get a 2-bedroom place and set up a room for my son, and they'd still hang out. That never happened. (I didn't expect it. He was the step-Dad, but it was he who promised it over and over.) My son never knew his biological father and calls this guy "Dad" to this day. Ex-husband started doing urban exploration just after we split up. That year, he got my son to spend his own money on equipment (from his savings from his job), and would say they would go do something. Then the day after, he'd say to my son, "Explored a great place. Here are pics," while my son had been waiting by the phone the day before for a call that he never got. Also, my ex hooked up with a women from his work who was 24 years old who he had previously tried to hook up with my son. We both found that creepy. (I was 41 at the time.)

&#x200B;

Got a call from my Dad later in the year at work in which he told me that after they had found lung cancer, he was going to go back in a week to find out more. The one and only time he called me at work. Well, his hearing was failing badly. It turned out that it was not lung cancer or anything concerning, but that scared me (and of course my Dad!) for a week.

&#x200B;

Towards the end of the year, I wasn't doing so good. AT the encouragement of my team lead at work, I started taking an anti-depressant. It was one that curbs appetite and I started not eating much, less than 1000 calories per day, and was not doing well with that.

&#x200B;

A new team lead came on who got my manager, product owner, and the team lead mentioned above fired. Got rid of all the contractors and half my team. I was terrified that I was next, so that was added worry.

&#x200B;

Due to not eating, the stress, and the worry about my family, I got into a very bad state. My son finally told me in December that he thought the medicine was really doing me harm. (He told me later that I was speaking very, very slowly and not making a lot of sense.) I had come to the same conclusion about the medicine and then I abruptly stopped taking it. Bad idea. I became suicidal. I tried to kill myself (not too hard) one night. It wasn't a cry for help, I was just too far gone to figure out a good way to do it. 

&#x200B;

I came to my senses a little in fear for my son and read some stuff online. (At that point, I was so far gone, I figured my son and everyone else I cared about but couldn't sooth was better off without me.) They said that people can't fix you, but you can ask for very specific help to alleviate stress. So, I called my brother and my ex-husband to my house and told my ex-husband that I needed him to do few specific things: 1) switch cars because we were driving each other's cars and I had already paid a fine because his tabs were expired and I'd also paid a parking ticket on MY car that he'd racked up, and 2) my husband to take his cats. 

&#x200B;

My ex tried to refuse to take his car pretending to be "nice", but he really just didn't want to be bothered to switch the stuff, so my son switched all the stuff and the keys (my son is an amazing person). My brother told me to take vitamin D.

&#x200B;

But I got crazier and made a much more serious attempt at killing myself a few days later. I ended up in the hospital. The good thing is that while there, they actually had me see a real doctor. He diagnosed me with Raynaud's and told me to come see him later. (When I did in January of next year, it turned out that although I had been taking vitamin D for 3 weeks by that point, that I was "overtly deficient").

&#x200B;

In the last part of that terrible year, I had also taken in my son's other friend who had been abused badly by his family. I talked to him for hours many days about his life and what his family had done. I took him to practice driving and took him for his driver's test. I got him set up to get his GED. (He had been kicked out of school 2 months before graduation for swearing a teacher.) I bought him supplies for his job. I took him to vote for the first time. (He was very serious about it and had done his research. I was proud.) I worried about him as much as my son. I actually considered adopting him, though he was legally an adult. In my head, I had taken him under my wing, even with all that was going on. I gave him chores, gave him restrictions and rules, tried to give him what little advice I could give.

&#x200B;

While I was in the worst state, my son asked me to kick his friend out, because the friend was bugging him a lot. My son saw this kid more as an annoying little brother than a friend. My son had actually said straight to my "other son's" face that he loved him on multiple occassions and also would say "stop acting stupid" in not so many words. My son is a sweetheart, but he was just a kid and just annoyed and didn't want this kid living with us anymore, though he loved my other son. Instead of trying to resolve the conflict, I agreed to kick my other son out. But he was, in my heart, my "other son". It hurt me to my core, but I was too out of it to figure out a solution. It was one of the things that made me so crazy at the end. I kept putting it off and putting it off and my son kept reminding me that I'd promised. I was so upset with myself for not being in the frame of mind to handle the situation.

&#x200B;

Epilogue: After the suicide attempt, early in 2009, I did kick my "other son" out. He sent me the kindest note in the world, thanking me and saying no one had ever cared about him like that, and he understood why I had asked him to leave. (I didn't deserve it, but I was grateful for the note.) He got his GED, got a job, finished a year of college, got some local fame and a city award as a rapper. But he died in 2012. He had moved out of a place with damage deposit for a new place, but being a sweetheart, he gave that money to a young woman he'd met who was trying to escape an abusive relationship so SHE could get a place. Unbeknownst to me, he then was camping out in some woods in our city for a week. At night while going to the store on his skateboard, he was hit and killed by a car. I will never forgive myself.

&#x200B;

In 2010, my Dad died. He died a horrible, horrible death (Lewy-body dementia, same thing that Robin Williams had).

&#x200B;

In 2015 my brother died, leaving two kids who were still dependent, being special needs kids. 

&#x200B;

In 2011, I had a guy I was seeing for a few months harrass me for over a year. 

&#x200B;

In 2011, I was physically assaulted and almost raped by a stranger. 

&#x200B;

In 2016, someone who had been my best friend from age 17 - 30 (and I considered my platonic soul mate) died in his late 40s. 

&#x200B;

Also in 2016, my son's very good friend killed himself. It was the fourth young person my son knew who had killed himself. I knew the kid well, also. My son will never be the same! All my "years from hell" compare not at all to what my son has been through these past years.

&#x200B;

Since that year from hell, all of my remaining aunts and uncles but one have died. The cat I inherited from my Dad (a feral alley cat he'd spent years gently taming) died. My son was far more devastated than I at her loss, because he was the one who got her fully to love us. First time she sat on someone's lap (when she was probably 12yo as per the vet), it was on my son's lap. He was her special human.
