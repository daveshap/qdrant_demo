See y’all on the other side ✌️
This will be my first suicide attempt, hopefully it works.Taking a lot of stuff that will make me sleepy, I also have asthma and it will make it harder to breathe, I will then tie a bag around my head and sleep.


Edit: well I’m alive I ended up passing out from all the sleeping meds and some other shit for like 15 hours on my floor, I feel slightly sick but that’s it, I’ve read all the comments and appreciate all of you, I’m going to wait until the end of the year before I decide if I still want to die.
