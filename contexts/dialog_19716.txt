NIXON: Fuck it! He doesn't like me, John! It's your fault, Henry.
KISSINGER: I beg your pardon --
NIXON: It's your people who are leaking to the Times. Wasn't this Ellsberg a student of yours at Harvard? He was your idea; why are you suddenly running for cover?
KISSINGER: He was, he was. We taught a class together at Harvard. But you know these back-stabbing Ivy League intellectuals, they can't ...
NIXON: No, Henry. I don't.
KISSINGER: He's turned into a drug fiend, he shot people from helicopters in Vietnam, he has sexual relations with his wife in front of their children. He sees a shrink in L.A. He's all fucked up. Now he's trying to be a hero to the liberals ... If he gets away with it, everybody will follow his lead. He must be stopped at all costs.
