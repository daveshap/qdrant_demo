Girlfriend trouble, but not serious?
I've been with this girl for about a year now. I really want to tell her how much she means to me, but I simply cant. Whenever I have anxiety attacks, she always sits there and tells me it's ok. She'll message me throughout the day "You got this!" And stuff like that. She is really amazing and I'm scared that whatever I say wont ever be enough to truly explain to her how much she means to me, so I don't. I keep closing myself off and it's kind if frustrating. Is there anything I could do to tell her that I love and care about her, without her thinking that I'm just trying to pass it off as not caring or being lazy? I dont want to lose this one.
