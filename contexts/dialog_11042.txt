GENCO: I know what you are thinking, Vitone, but you don't understand yet how things are. Fanucci is of the Black Hand. Everyone in the neighborhood pays him, even my father.
VITO: He's an Italian?
GENCO: A pig of a Neaponitan.
VITO: Why? Why does he bother other Italians?
GENCO: Because he knows them; he knows they have no one to protect them. Vitone? What do you think of my angel?
VITO: Beautiful.
GENCO: Beautiful.
VITO: For you, she is beautiful. For me, there is only my wife!
GENCO: I know. That's why I brought you with me!
GENCO: I bet you can't guess what happened?
VITO: What?
GENCO: Some guys from Ninth Avenue jumped Fanucci today; slit his throat from ear to ear.
VITO: No, I didn't know. Is he dead?
GENCO: Nah. Those guys aren't murderers. They wanted to scare him, that's all. Make him look bad.
VITO: In Sicily, when you attack a man, you had better finish him.
GENCO: I wish they had. He takes fifty dollars a week from my father's cash drawer. But you can't kill a man like Fanucci.
VITO: Why?
GENCO: Because he's what we say... &quot;connected&quot;... You wait, see what happens to those guys from Ninth Avenue.
