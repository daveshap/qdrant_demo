Unemployed nurse, now overqualified for non-nursing jobs. Running out of time before I can't afford my rent. Your advice, please!
Hello, I'm new to the sub, but I'm glad I found it! I will try to keep my post concise. I really appreciate any advice.

I am 26. I have a bachelor's degree in nursing and have been working full time as an RN for 4 years in various healthcare settings. I am currently unemployed. My previous job was at a large dialysis clinic in one of the worst areas of my city. The clinic was chronically, absurdly understaffed. The patients were literally uncontrollable at times. The clinic lacked leadership and communication from management. Much of the staff just didn't care much anymore, and the ones that did were going crazy trying to pick up the slack and do their best. After just 9 months at this clinic, I developed severe depression and anxiety. I took a 1 month leave of absence and voluntarily attended a 2 week outpatient day program at a local hospital. I quit as soon as my LOA was over. I didn't give them 2 weeks notice. I fully understand the consequences of having done this. I had been actively looking for other jobs for about 3 months when I quit, but did not have a job lined up before quitting. I decided I would rather work an entry level job than continue working at that clinic because my sanity was worth more than my very nice paychecks.

Fast forward 2 months, and I am finding that I am not even being considered for non-nursing jobs, most likely because I am overqualified (according to my dad). What complicates things is that I am pretty burned out with nursing altogether. At this time, I am really not interested in direct patient care. I have applied to the very few jobs in my area that don't involve patient care, such as insurance company nurse jobs, but none have worked out, even though my multiple interviews went well. I look often for these types of jobs, but they are very few and far between. I just feel I need a break from nursing for a while to regain my confidence and resiliency.

When at my previous job, my boyfriend was making about half of what I made, so I paid the majority of the household bills and rent. We don't have enough income to pay our bills with just his income. My parents have gifted us a good amount of money over the past 2 months to help us, and I know they would continue to if needed. Obviously that's not what I want though. I want a full time job. I have done the math, and to pay our bills without help, I would need to make somewhere around $15/hour.  When you narrow the search down, there are really very few jobs in my area that pay close to this, are full time, are something I can physically do, and don't require a specific certification or education.

I have unsuccessfully applied for about 5 overnight bakery jobs (no experience required), watch battery technician, entry level furniture refinisher, medical equipment warehouse technician, inventory lead at a local candy store, entry level dental lab technician, entry level insurance claims processor.

I'm just at a loss of what to do anymore.

Should I apply to jobs I know pay too little and try to work overtime? Any suggestions for companies that will not disqualify me for being overqualified?

TL;DR

Unemployed burnt out nurse, overqualified for non-nursing jobs. Where should I look?
