Zero motivation to live but zero motivation to die. Just kinda want to not exist but not die at the same time?
I dont know if that makes sense. Feeling massively depressed for most of my life growing up and I feel like even if I get over depression I won't get over trauma I experienced which sorta still creeps up on me. At times I wish i could disappear cause I feel it wouldn't matter, but I can't make myself do it cause i know itd hurt people even if I tell myself they wouldn't bother. 


I get by by just sorta blocking these feelings and depersonalizing to the point it doesnt hit me but it leaves me feeling totally dead inside which I guess is why id rather not be alive cause it doesnt feel like im living yknow?

The only time I feel something genuinely is when I hurt myself but it leaves my face bruised and its hard to make up excuses when people ask but sometimes I wish someone would ask about it genuinely because its draining feeling this disconnected from the world and myself and im too afraid to find help so it just eats away at me
