Lost my job this week, but NOT because of Covid-19. My employer used it as an excuse.
So as the title states, I found myself in a very strange situation. Tuesday of this week I was laid off from my job, along with 7 others . Six of us were in different areas of IT ( Information Security, DBA, development, administration, etc) The other two were from different states. More layoffs happened in Canada as well. The company specializes relocation and naturally has been hit hard by the current pandemic. So initial you'd think it was because of Covid-19 and business is slow. But during the call with HR and a manager were I was told I was being let go, I found out I was laid off because the company and had done an IT Assessment prior to Covid-19 breaking lose. Even the papers they emailed me to sign all point to a company restructure with no reference to Covid-19. But it appears they are using it as an excuse or cover to jettison 8 people on the same day. My manager was also laid off. The company stated they would give a severance package and wouldn't fight an unemployment claim. Anyone else in IT that wasn't laid off say a 10% salary cut. Now that's important because that's the only reference to the current pandemic my employer has made.

Naturally I filed for unemployment but the thing is I had to lie to both the Unemployment office and my apartment complex. I didn't lose my job because of Covid-19, they are restructuring and used this pandemic to do it.

I'm looking for work currently but I'm curious if anyone has ever heard of this or dealt with someone similar? I've done what I can for now, just wanted to get someone else's perspective. Seems pretty sleazy to do it this way. Now they've made unneeded stress and anxiety in my life.
