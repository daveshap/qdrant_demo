ELECTRA: I wasn't watching television.
WOMAN: The point is, they are paying for information. Real information. Not tooth paste brands. Not whether he wads of folds his toilet paper. And no 16 hours of recorded phone sex. You are wasting everyone's time with this shit.
ELECTRA: I thought it was interesting --
WOMAN: God damnit, Electra. This is not a game. This is business.
ELECTRA: Right. In my hands I have five back-up disks he made of all of his work last night.
WOMAN: Jesus! Why didn't you tell me?
ELECTRA: I'll make my usual arrangements and expect my usual bonus.
WOMAN: Electra --
ELECTRA: A pleasure doing business with you.
