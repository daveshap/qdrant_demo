NORMAN: I'm not paranoid. I know Beth. She can be drastic.
BARNES: How drastic?
NORMAN: You don't want to know.
BARNES: I think I do.
NORMAN: A while back, Beth and I -- we worked at the same university. She was assisting a chemist there -- I forget his name -- doing research, experiments. She was also living with him. Yeah, I know. And when she finished her work, he kicked her out, broke off the relationship, and published five papers -- all her work -- without any thank you or acknowledgement.
BARNES: She should've known better.
NORMAN: She put a razor to her wrists a day later.
BARNES: When was this?
NORMAN: '81, I think. She tried again five years ago. I thought you should know.
BARNES: So you knew this when you wrote your report?
NORMAN: At the time, I don't know, I thought putting her on the list -- it might help her career -- catch her a break.
BARNES: You knowingly recommended a woman with suicidal tendencies for a government operation --
NORMAN: Wait a second --
BARNES: -- and then brought her down here --
NORMAN: -- I didn't know it would come to this --
BARNES: -- without a cautionary word to anyone. You know, Ted said something to me earlier. I think he's right. He said, When you got a guy who -- if he wasn't here -- he'd be standing in the unemployment line
