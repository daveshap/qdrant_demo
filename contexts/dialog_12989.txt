PAUL: This won't do.
TATIANA: It will do just fine.
PAUL: Any luck?
TATIANA: No answer. Please send someone to get them, please.
PAUL: I'll try.
MR. GARINDI: Terrible times, Paul. There are bodies everywhere. I cannot stay here.
PAUL: I need a great favor.
PAUL: I need you to go to this address and bring my brother-in-law and his family.
MR. GARINDI: No, no. This is a very dangerous part of town. I cannot do this.
PAUL: This would be an enormous favor to me. I am a man of means, Mr. Garandi. When this nonsense is over I will be most grateful.
MR. GARINDI: I will see what I can do.
