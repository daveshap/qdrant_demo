Resume Templates
For extra cash, I've been redesigning CVs for some professionals and I thought of sharing the designs with Reddit.

I linked three of the designs I made below. [Preview](http://imgur.com/a/Cq7Zx)

First I'd like to apologize for the weird titles, companies and cities. I tried to mask the real customers as much as I can but keep the descriptions as examples. I also tried to be creative with the changes but that turned out to be more difficult than I anticipated.

As for the designs, I always try to create attractive CVs without compromising their professionalism. I admit sometimes I got carried away with them, but hopefully not too much.

I also hyperlink where I think the HR employee would copy/paste into Google. The fields usually are the name (link it to their LinkedIn), companies (to their websites), and awards (their websites). I also hide the hyperlink (the underlined blue) so to not ruin the design.

I also have a lot of tips on how to design your cv with an effective flow and what not. I've done A LOT of research when I was jobless and now I'm happy to say that I have a much higher callback rate (not solely because of the designs, but I think thy helped). I would love to share them with you if interested.

Hope you like them :)
