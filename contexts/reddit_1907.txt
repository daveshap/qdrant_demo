I can't believe our grade is applying to colleges now
Does anyone else feel like it's crazy how our grade is applying to colleges now? I feel like I still remember freshman year so clearly. I remember every year I would think "I wonder how the seniors are w/ college apps" and now it's our turn!! It's all happening so quickly
