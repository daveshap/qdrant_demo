DANNY: Oh. Hi.
COLETTE: What happened to your eye?
DANNY: Turns out I'm allergic to steel-toed boots. Go figure. By the way, I'm not looking for a matching set. Where's Quincey?
COLETTE: Don't worry. He's out of town.
DANNY: How far out of town?
COLETTE: Trust me. We're safe.
DANNY: Miles Davis. All Blues.""
COLETTE: Never heard of him.
DANNY: Just a fucked-up guy who played beautiful music.
COLETTE: Like you?
DANNY: Nah. I'm strictly minor league... except for the fucked-up part.
DANNY: Dude played his soul right out the end of the horn. No false notes. Always honest.
COLETTE: And you admire that?
DANNY: It's the only way to play.
COLETTE: Is that how you play?
DANNY: I try.
