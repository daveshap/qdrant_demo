When should TouchID/Fingerprint log-in expire? I couldn't find such a standard which mention about TouchID or fingerprint log in expiration date.Suppose I have an application and allow users to log in using the fingerprint. I would like to know for how long should I allow my user to log in with fingerprint before I required them to enter the password again. For example, allow the user to log in using fingerprint for 3 months and every 3 months user need to re-enter the password.Is there such a standard specify about the time length? or it can last forever?
