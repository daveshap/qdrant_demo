Has this every happened to you, because I find this very rare.
When I was in the 5th grade many years ago, there was this kid that had Angelman syndrome and he was the nicest kid in the world. One day, he asked me for a pencil, a basic wooden #2 pencil, and I gave it to him. He had never ever been that happy for a wooden pencil, . Moving forward to 7th grade, I was moving out of America and the kid was in the same class as me still. He was absent because of a really major seizure. On my final day of school, his mom came in and called my name. The kid literally gifted me a 20 dollar silver mechanical pencil just because I lended him a wooden pencil. Until this day, I have the box of the pencil on the desk of my room, and I wish to meet that kid again.

Q&A:

1. Q, What is Angelmans syndrome?

&#x200B;

A, Angelman syndrome aka happy puppet syndrome is a genetic disorder that causes developmental and neurological disabilities. They usually have epilepsy, and get attracted to water easily. But I hope that who ever suffers from this can rebound and shine like an angel.
