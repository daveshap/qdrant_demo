Extremely slow job starts?
So i just graduated with an environmental science degree in May and finally find a job that didn't decide to rescind their offer for no reason !(happened once lol) the people are really nice and I really enjoyed my first day


The only thing is, there was a LOT of downtime, and my 2 managers basically said the first month or so is going to be very slow and to "get used to it"(albeit they said it in a nice way)

It's also weird because I don't have a computer to use yet, so if I want to look up stuff that can potentially help me ( it's a regulatory based job, so looking up some regulation that I need to refresh myself on can really help) I have to use my phone which looks like I'm texting or redditing or something. And sitting around doing nothing makes me feel like I'm just wasting time.

I'm sure tomorrow on day 2 they will have more time(today both of my managers were in meetings all day and told me that it was payroll day. Initially my first day was supposed to be tomorrow, but they wanted me in asap)and they will be able to give me more stuff to do probably more training but yeah.
