CONSTANZE: Thank you very much, Your Excellency.
SALIERI: Don't keep calling me that. It puts me at such a distance. I was not born a Court Composer, you know. I'm from a small town, just like your husband.
SALIERI: Are you sure you can't leave that music, and come back again? I have other things you might like.
CONSTANZE: That's very tempting, but it's impossible, I'm afraid. Wolfi would be frantic if he found those were missing. You see, they're all originals.
SALIERI: Originals?
CONSTANZE: Yes.
SALIERI: These are originals?
CONSTANZE: Yes, sir. He doesn't make copies.
