MIMI: Chris may be at the club -- or somewhere -- I don't see that it's important --
NICK: You should have told them he'd disappeared.
MIMI: But he has nothing to do with it!
NICK: That's not for you to decide. Everybody's under suspicion - especially running off like this -- The police will want his description. Is this a picture of him?
MIMI: I tell you -- he didn't do it.
NICK: They'll want more than your word for that.
MIMI: All right, then -- I'll tell them who did do it!
DOROTHY: Mother!
MIMI: And I'll give then proof!
