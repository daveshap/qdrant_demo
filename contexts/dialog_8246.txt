THE PATIENT: I think anybody she ever loves tends to die on her.
CARAVAGGIO: Are you planning to be the exception?
THE PATIENT: Me? You've got the wrong end of the stick, old boy. So - Caravaggio - Hana thinks you invented your name.
CARAVAGGIO: And you've forgotten yours.
THE PATIENT: I told her you would never invent such a preposterous name.
CARAVAGGIO: I told her you can forget everything but you never forget your name.
OFFICER: What about your rank or serial number?
THE PATIENT: No. I think I was a pilot. I was found near the wreckage of a plane by the Bedouin. I was with them for some time.
