The statistical power of cluster level predictors in linear mixed effects models I have a data on 10,000 people in total sampled from among 50 countries. I built a linear mixed effect model with a country level predictor--sex-ratio of the that country--and want to see the relationship on an individual level predictor (a response on a questionnaire). I've modeled country as a random effect, as well as world region of the country to partially control for non-independence of sex ratios; neighbouring countries might have similar sex ratios for similar reasons. Is my statistical sample size ~50 because that's how many countries I have? or ~10,000 because that's the number of participants I have?Thanks!
