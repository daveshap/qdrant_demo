My dog has cancer :(
We just found out last week my dog (11yr old husky mix) has cancer . A mass between the pads on his paw came back cancerous . There is never a good time to hear the word cancer ,but right now it's even harder. My dad has been out of work and fighting a car accident claim that left his back pretty messed up and he does manual labor for a living, my mom is on a fixed income and going through all kinds of medical issues herself . We just lost a dog last year ( had him put down as he was pretty old and had no quality of life left) .
This dog is my baby I've had him since he was old enough to leave his mom, he has saved my moms life a few times and he is what helped us figure out she had a brain aneurysm and were able to get it fixed in time. He is pretty much her service dog , and my son loves him to death . I made a GoFundMe to try and help with the cost of surgery but none of my family and friends are donating , I know that sounds horrible but I have always helped these people when they were in need or had a GoFundMe of their own for pets or other things. I'm just frustrated and stressed out on what to do and how to afford this surgery ,and I absolutely can not lose my dog . I'm selling anything and everything I can . Sorry if this isn't the right place to put this I just needed to vent to someone other than my husband .
