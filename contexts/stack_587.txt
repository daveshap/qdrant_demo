Single USB install Xubuntu or regular I have done a lot of reading about Live CDs and I currently have got a bootable Ubuntu USB built with unetbootin. My question is how would I go about installing say Xubuntu to the memory stick itself. I.e. I am very happy having Windows but want to run a full working linux from memory stick (which can read Windows files) - which I can install applications to and most importanly keep upto date with the latest releases (i.e. Persistant live versions don't always allow this).But I only have 1x 30GB USB stick. Can I do it just using that?Am I right in thinking that the default Ubuntu installer installs to the main harddrive as opposed to overwriting itself on the USB stick?This is unlike 16988 due to the fact I am running on Windows and therefore don't have the luxury of the virtualisation suggested in that answer.
