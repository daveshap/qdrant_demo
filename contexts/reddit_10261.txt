nobody cares if youre suicidal until you actually commit suicide
I often fantasize about dying. I don't want to be here anymore. it's not even so much out of sadness anymore as it is just out of thinking realistically. there's literally no point. the only thing holding me back from doing it is I don't want to do that to my parents. 
besides feeling like I just want to be dead, I also deal with intense depression and thoughts that torment me. I can't shake the feeling that something is just wrong with me and I'm never going to be happy or deserve to be happy. there's this void in me and no matter what I do, nothing fills it. 

I tried talking to my ex about this while we were dating. I told him about my self harm and how I just want to die. about the self harm, he told me to cut the "right way" if I wanted real results. for the depression and suicidal thoughts, he said he felt the same except he had a worse life, so his depression was more justified. he said I have a lot to be happy for. 

it just made me want to kill myself even more. but the thing is, I don't think I want to die. I just wish everything would stop and I could start over as someone else. 
and honestly, when I think about killing myself, I fantasize about it not working, but working just enough to hospitalize me. it's a sick fucking thought, I know.
I think the main reason I want to attempt suicide is so the people around me will realize that I'm not just faking it or "choosing" to be depressed. it's not just for attention... which is ironic to say, considering I want to do it literally to get their attention. but I just feel like, in order for my pain to be taken seriously, I need to show it to people somehow.
