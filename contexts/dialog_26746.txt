MIKE: You asshole. Why are you carrying a gun? What? In case someone steps to you, Snoop Dogg?
SUE: Hey, man, you're not from here. You don't know how it is. I grew up in L.A...
TRENT: ...Anaheim...
SUE: ...Whatever. Things are different here. It's not like New York, Mikey.
MIKE: Yeah. Here it's easier to avoid trouble. It's not like you like in Compton where bullets are whizzing by your head every day. Nobody's mugging you on no subway. In New York the trouble finds you. Out here you gotta go look for it...
SUE: ...People get carjacked...
TRENT: ...Oh, who would jack your fuckin K- car? He's right, Sue. You don't need no gat.
SUE: Listen. Just because I was the only one with the balls to stand up to them...
TRENT: ...Oh yeah, like Cypress Hill" was gonna do anything..."
MIKE: You live in such a fantasy world...
SUE: What about you, Mikey? At least I got balls. You're always whining about some bitch who dumped you a year ago...
MIKE: ...It was six months, and she didn't dump...
SUE: ...Whatever. You're like a whining little woman. Big deal. You got a fuckin' number. Whoopee! You'll fuck it up...
TRENT: ...Sue...
SUE: Have you gotten laid once since you moved here? Did you fuck once?
TRENT: ...Shut up, Sue...
SUE: I know for a fact you haven't, because you never shut up about it. You're like a little whiney bitch...
TRENT: Sue!
