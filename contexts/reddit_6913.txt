Saw my job posted on company’s career page. How should I proceed?
Background: I’ve been employed in the company for a bit over 3 months.  I was previously laid off from my last job due to budget cuts, so the last thing I need is another one. 

Today, while browsing through my company’s career page, I noticed that my job was posted (I’m pretty sure it’s mine because I am solely responsible for one aspect of the job, which is included in the posting). The only difference is this one is a mid level while mine is entry. Also, my department is small and we have a small contract, so I doubt they will hire someone else; I am unaware of any of the staff leaving. 

It did take me a while to get use to the job, as I changed industries. I’m just starting to get the hang of it, but am still trying to figure things out, which, according to other colleagues, is fine. 

Also, I have not been given a formal warning about my performance. I haven’t even had my 90 day review. Should I worry? 

TLDR: found my job listed on company career page; worried I may be fired. Employed at company for a bit over 90 days.
