EVELYN: ...Well, it didn't make him happy...
ESCOBAR: But there is no possibility he would have taken his own life?
EVELYN: No.
ESCOBAR: Mrs. Mulwray, do you happen to know the name of the young woman in question?
EVELYN: No.
ESCOBAR: Do you know where she might be?
EVELYN: Certainly not!
ESCOBAR: You and your husband never discussed her?
EVELYN: He... we did... he wouldn't tell me her name. We quarreled over her... of course. It came as a complete surprise to me.
ESCOBAR: A complete surprise?
EVELYN: Yes.
ESCOBAR: But I thought you'd hired a private investigator.
EVELYN: A private investigator?
ESCOBAR: Mr. Gittes.
EVELYN: Well yes.
