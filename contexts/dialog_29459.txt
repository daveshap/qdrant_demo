ROBERT: The cocaine brand, 911, is an East Coast brand, a Juarez Cartel brand, and you must know it usually comes through into El Paso?
JAVIER: I'm aware of that.
ROBERT: So what's it doing in Tijuana?
ROBERT: Let me ask you a hypothetical question: if Salazar worked for Madrigal and the Juaraz cartel, and he went out of power, would it mean the Juarez Cartel is losing influence?
JAVIER: It could mean that, yes.
ROBERT: That would probably mean the Tijuana Cartel is gaining power?
JAVIER: It's possible.
ROBERT: Is it possible to have a Drug Czar in Mexico who isn't connected in some war to one of the cartels?
