How do i forgive myself?
Hey reddit, I(19M) have a little problem ... It's hard for me to forgive myself. I have a few regrets, mistakes and I am extremely critical of them. I barfed, I hurted people, I wanted some people to die ... Things like that.  Now I don't do anything I used to do before ... I made myself aware of what I did, I didn't do it anymore, I asked for forgiveness where I could, but it still doesn't seem enough to forgive me.
Sorry for bad english, made the text with google translate
