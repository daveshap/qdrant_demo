HAGEN: Just now when Johnny Ola showed up, he asked me to leave them alone. Ola is Hyman Roth's Sicilian contact. I was on the inside of ten, twenty meetings with him. But today Mike asked me to leave, like an outsider.

HAGEN: It's as though he blames me for the ground the family lost when I was Consigliere to Sonny.
