New eyeglasses, so happy.
I've ridiculous sighted. Like, I'd be dead if glasses didn't exist and hadn't had a new pair in like 4 years. And my lenses had fogged and the coatings had half scratched off. So I set aside for eye exam, and then was like Okay, walmart. I know my lenses are going to eat my budget. Boy. Boy did they ever. I cried after I left because I had a 200 dollar budget and my lenses took up 197 of that. I had a choice of like 4 different frames. That's pretty much it. So I ordered the least offensive and left. 

Next day I called to cancel, a friend told me to hands down, go online. I had my PD, I had my prescription, go online. So I called up walmart and canceled and spent an hour uploading a picture and taking a chance on glasses online. Zenni's to be precise. What was 220 bucks with walmart, was 77 bucks with zenni's. That included their fastest shipping, super thin lenses, and case and clip ons. I though okay, worst is I just learned a 77 dollar lesson. 

They came today. I'm in tears and it's good tears. I can see why my migraines picked up frequency. I'm not looking through a haze, and they look -good-. There is no buyers remorse, there's no WTF am I doing. 

So if you're like me, and you are in desperate need of new glasses and I know that it's like super scary to think about buying your -eyeglasses- online, try. For the price of 1 walmart pair, I have a pair, can get sunglasses to protect my eyes in the summer and then also get another spare frame of the same kind, just in case god forbid, something happens. And still get groceries for the week. 

And they don't look like shit. At all. They look REALLY great and I love them as much as my old pair that I kept getting repaired because I loved them so much.
