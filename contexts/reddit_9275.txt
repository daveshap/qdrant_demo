Keep a list on you with "benchmark pricing" for your common purchases so you can determine whether a sale/clearance is actually a good buy
I keep a list in my phone of 30 different items that I buy a lot of (TP, paper towel, deodorant, bulk meat, chicken, etc). I track the benchmark price of each of those items which I have determined based on shopping at the cheapest places, like Aldi and Costco. Example, Costco Toilet paper is $.01/sq foot, and Dove Shampoo is $0.18 an ounce, Aldi aluminum foil is $.026 per foot. This way when I am shopping and see sale or clearance prices for the similar items, for example, charmin at walgreens, costco bulk foil,  i can quickly determine whether that product in its current size is a good deal based on my bench mark prices.  This has saved me a lot of money by finding great deals on clearance/sale, but also saved me money by avoiding a purchase that appeared to be a good deal until I compared the price to my benchmark
