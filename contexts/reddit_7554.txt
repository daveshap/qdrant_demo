I'm dropping out of grad school.
I had my last final today & it was an absolute trainwreck. I didn't expect to do well at all, but it was even worse than I imagined. I might as well have not even bothered studying.

Regardless, I guess it doesn't really matter anyway. I will be dropping out of grad school. I have been absolutely miserable during the entire experience. I was miserable during the application process & ever since I started attending grad school I have been overwhelmed with thoughts of not wanting to be there & how I'm wasting my time. The professors I had were absolutely awful & the classes were a slog to sit through.

I can't see myself having a future in general, but grad school is definitely not going to help me in the long run. Especially being that I never wanted to go in the first place. I've posted a lot on this sub to vent my frustrations with everything & I wanted to take a moment to thank everyone who took the time to respond to me. While I will admit there were many comments that did not help me as well as many people that were flat out rude to me, I do appreciate those of you who were kind & patient with me.

My future is extremely bleak & I can't imagine any good will come out of out, but at least I won't have the misery of school added to the mix anymore. This will be my last post on this sub. Good luck to all of you sticking it out in grad school. I wish you al the best!
