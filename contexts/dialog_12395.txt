HELLBOY: But I understand what you don't like about me. I do. What I am makes you feel out of place -- out there --
LIZ: Red, I --
HELLBOY: Listen. I'm not like Myers. He makes you feel like you belong. And -- that's good. It really is. I -- wish I could do something about this -- But I can't. I can promise you only two things... One: I'll always look this good. Two: I won't give up on you. Ever.
LIZ: I like that...
HELLBOY: Good.
