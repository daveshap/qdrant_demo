GLASS: Nice performance back there. Where'd you learn that, Mike Ditka Sensitivity Seminar?
REILLY: Hey, look--
GLASS: No you look, mister! First, you don't go calling my men names. It's bad for morale. Second, us punks" happen to know a heck of alot more about police work than any vice cop ever did."
REILLY: Oh yeah? Prove it.
GLASS: Drive.
REILLY: The place has already be combed. Forensics pulled over a hundred sets of prints inside.
GLASS: Then let's go see what they missed.
GLASS: So what were they doing here?
REILLY: I don't know. You tell me?
GLASS: An abandoned machine shop... nice place to build devices. Low rent, too. But, you and Rice ruined their perfect hideout.
REILLY: You mentioned something called Redstone.
GLASS: Redstone's the army training center in Alabama where they send the cream of the crop to learn about tickers.
REILLY: Cream of the crop, huh? You?
GLASS: Top of my class at West Point, thank you very much. Then off to Redstone. First half of the course we learned how to build devices... second half, we'd take them apart. Everything from firecrackers to hydrogen bombs.
REILLY: Sounds like terrorist heaven.
GLASS: There were a few guys in my class with names like John Smith, Bill Jones. I'd see them up ahead in the hall, call their name, but they wouldn't turn around. C.I.A. Funny thing, they'd always disappear after the first half of the course.
REILLY: Just how easy is it to build a... device?
GLASS: With a little training, you could go into a house and just from stuff in the bathroom and kitchen make something that'd finish off that alleged car of yours. Heck, didn't you ever watch MacGyver?
