To whoever needs to hear this...
I was Army Infantry for 10 years. Did 3 tours in Iraq. I've had PTSD and depression for a while now. It gets really dark sometimes, even with my wife (who is wonderful) and kids (who are great but a handful) pulling me up. I've checked myself into the VA mental ward for suicide thoughts, been fired for threatening co-workers, and lost friends because of the way I speak.

It does get better. It's a struggle everyday. It's not easy at all. But there are reasons to keep going, to keep trying to make things better. I don't have all the answers. Hell most days I don't have any answers. I just have hope I guess.

Keep fighting. You can pull through.
