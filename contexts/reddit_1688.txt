My Dartmouth interviewer made a *SIZE* joke during my interview
I wish this was a shitpost...

The interviewer I got was probably in his late 50s to early 60s, very proud of his school, and struck me as the 'former frat boy' type.

He starts the interview by asking, "What's your biggest accomplishment?"

Me: "Hm, I would definitely say my biggest acc-"

Him: "Not that size matters, ha! I bet you wouldn't worry about that" **(gesturing down)**

*(For context, I'm about 6'4")*

At first I thought he was talking about my height and laughed with him, thinking this was one of those *"oh wow you're so tall, do you play basketball?"* moments... until I realized what he actually meant. It was actually really funny now that I think of it. I wasn't uncomfortable or anything, it just caught me off guard.

Overall though the interview went really ~~good~~ well! He was a fun personality- it just took some getting used to!

Edit: Again, not a shitpost. Yes it actually happened.

Edit 2: Grammar
