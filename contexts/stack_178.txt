How do I change focal distance in iPhone SE When I try to take a photo through  window screen, the plane of focus is the window screen rather than the things outside.  Is there any way to forcibly change the focal distance when every part of the field of view is covered by the window screen?  I want a close-up shot, of the thing outside, so stepping back from the window screen is not ideal.I am using an iPhone SE. On an \"old\" style camera, I would adjust the lense to change the focal distance.
