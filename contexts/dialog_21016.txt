SUSAN: I don't believe it. You're here! Oh thank God.
O'BRIEN: You didn't think I could just leave you?
SUSAN: I didn't know what was going to happen. I was just so worried something was going to happen to you.
O'BRIEN: What could happen? I'm the plastic man, remember?
SUSAN: Oh no! Argon! We have to stop him before he uses the nanobot! We have to get the nanobot!
O'BRIEN: Where is it?
SUSAN: Argon's private lab.
O'BRIEN: Let's go.
