Can the CKM matrix supply the CP asymmetry as required by baryogenesis, in principle? In the process of Baryogenesis through Leptogenesis from the decay of heavy Majorana neutrinos, the necessary CP violation is perhaps provided only by the CP phases in the PMNS matrix. But the Weak interactions in the SM also violate CP through the CKM matrix. However, since Leptogenesis talks about the lepton sector and since the CKM matrix talks about CP violation in the quark sector, I guess that the CKM matrix cannot supply CP asymmetry for Leptogenesis. For Leptogenesis, it is the complex phases of PMNS matrix (not the CKM matrix) that supply the necessary CP asymmetry. Correct me if wrong.Question If the CKM matrix cannot contribute to Leptogenesis, can it supply the CP violation some other way, at least in principle, through some other mechanism of baryogenesis (no matter how small)?
