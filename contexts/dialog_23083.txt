STU: Dude. What are you doing here?
BILLY: I was hoping Sid and I could talk.
SIDNEY: If Tatum sees you -- she'll draw blood.
STU: You guys can go up to my parents room? To talk and... whatever.
BILLY: Subtlety, Stu. Look it up.
SIDNEY: It's okay. We need to talk.
RANDY: What's Leatherface doing here?
STU: He came to make up.
RANDY: There goes my chance with Sid.
STU: Like you had one.
