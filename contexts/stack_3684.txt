How to know which interaction terms to include in a regression model? I'm trying to fit a model with one response variable and 11 predictors. Of these 11 predictors: 5 are continuous, 4 are dichotomous and 3 are categorical (containing between 3-7 different categories, which I've coded with dummy variables). I'm having a difficult time trying to figure out which interaction terms to include in the maximum model. Any hints would be greatly appreciated!
