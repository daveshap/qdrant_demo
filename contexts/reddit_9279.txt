It's so true - being poor is so expensive
There are many reasons why, but today, shopping at Costco, I realized why. Back when I was dirt poor, I would have to buy the single, 20 sheet roll of paper towel, or the 25 pack of diapers for $10. When comparing per unit pricing on these small quantity items to the bulk, you are literally spending 3-5x as much. It's terrifying how much waste there is when you can't afford a $40, 250 pack of diapers, or a $20 200 ounce bottle of laundry detergent.  I see it a lot at the dollar stores where people load up on tiny 6 ounce bottles of ketchup, or 1 ounce bags of shredded cheese. If you can cut it, it really makes a huge difference when you buy your regular items in bulk, as long as you are verifying significant savings based on per unit cost.
