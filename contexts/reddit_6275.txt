Can I get my social from a old employer?
Hey I just got hired at a new job, but I can’t find my social anywhere & they’re asking for it today or tomorrow so I can get onboard 
I remember old employers making a copy of my social for whatever reason 
Is it possible I can obtain at least a picture of it from a old employer
