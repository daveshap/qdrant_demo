Single word or short phrase for 'people in service occupations with whom one deals as customer' I am looking for a single word or short phrase describing the people with whom one deals in everyday situations (attendants and workers in shops, hair salons, banks, bying tickets, etc.). The problem is to contrast this group of people (as a separate entity) with other groups: friends, relatives, colleagues, acquaintances, online friends. Example made-up sentence: I find it easy speaking to my colleagues, friends, and other people I already know, but I have a problem with maintaining normal communication with Xs.Xs - is for the term I am looking for (people serving customers in shops, malls, banks, etc.)
