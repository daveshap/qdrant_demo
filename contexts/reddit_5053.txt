College physics student denied from fast food
Explanatory story: 
I’m a college student, who worked for a year after high school due to not having the financial ability to pay for college. (I refused to go into too much debt, I’m financially educated, and won’t dig myself a pit)

After being accepted to university, and willing myself back into school, I had to quit my job (full time day job) so I could attend classes. 

I’m now in a position where I have to rent an apartment, and pay other expenses, on top of school. And need to get another job as money is running out.

I’m majoring in Physics, and Music Education (I know I know, I’m debating between physicist or band director, whichever makes me happier) 

And I have 2 previous jobs who would give good recommendations, one being a physical labor full time job. 

So, back on track. I’m being denied from FAST FOOD restaurants with this resume. An unnamed drink place better hire Albert Einstein to make their smoothies, because idk who else is more qualified.

How is a college student supposed to support themselves if fast food won’t even hire them?? Am I just immensely unlucky in this situation and patience is in order?


TLDR: Hardworking college student with lots of good job experience being denied from fast food restaurants, and simple entry level jobs for some reason.
