MARION: The door, Jack.
JACK: Leave it.
MARION: No. Answer it!
BELLA: You fucking little shit! You shopped me.
JACK: What are you talking about?
BELLA: Reynolds got a doctor in. They forced me to take a dope test. It was positive. As you knew.
JACK: I don't know anything about it.
BELLA: Your boyfriend fucked me, smoked my dope, then shopped me. What do you think of that? I can't get a job now. You bastard. You're no different from Matt. A pair of vicious little shits, that's what you are.
JACK: Look Bella, I don't know anything about this. You should talk to Matt.
BELLA: You're all scumbags.
