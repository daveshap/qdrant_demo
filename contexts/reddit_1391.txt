What people think is a cure for anxiety is actually one of its causes.
When I am feeling anxious and am searching the internet for advice I often come across some form of this:

"Understand that your anxiety is illogical and that you aren't actually in danger"

Suggesting that if you realize this, the anxiety will go away. In my experience it is the exact opposite. Just feeling anxious is one thing. I've felt anxious before big events, it's not pleasant, but if I don't fight it, it comes and goes and I move on. But feeling anxious and knowing you shouldn't be is where the problems really start. When I am anxious and know I shouldn't be, I worry that something is wrong with me and that adds to my anxiety. I can stay like this for weeks or months and I only seem to be able to break the cycle when something especially good happens and I get distracted enough to stop rejecting how I am feeling.

In the last year I have had considerable success overcoming anxiety by accepting it when it comes. This is way harder than it sounds. It's like flexing a muscle you didn't know you had. When I start feeling anxious, I make the conscious effort to accept how I'm feeling. I can't pull it off all the time, but I'm getting better and better at it. The trick is that you have to really believe it. You have to decide that how you are feeling is completely acceptable. You can't trick yourself and "accept" your anxiety in the hope that it will go away. You have to really be OK with it sticking around, and just like that it will be gone. It will come back, but you will be building up a skill that will allow you to once again let it pass.

Edit: Talking with several other anxiety sufferers, I'm finding that this advice is more applicable to people who experience chronic low-level anxiety and less applicable to people who experience acute panic attacks.
