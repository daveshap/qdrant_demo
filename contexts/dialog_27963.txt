THELMA: Louise. Where are we going?
LOUISE: I don't know, Thelma! I don't know! Just shut up a minute so I can think.
THELMA: Shouldn't we go to the cops? I mean, I think we should tell the police.
LOUISE: Tell them what?! What, Thelma? What do you think we should tell them?
THELMA: I don't know. Just tell 'em what happened.
LOUISE: Which part?
THELMA: All of it. That he tried to rape me.
LOUISE: Only about a hundred people saw you cheek to goddamn cheek with him all night, Thelma! Who's gonna believe that?! We just don't live in that kind of world. Pull over!
