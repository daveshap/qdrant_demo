RICK: Ilsa is Laszlo's wife. She probably knows things that Strasser would like to know. Louis, I'll make a deal with you. Instead of this petty charge you have against him, you can get something really big, something that would chuck him in a concentration camp for years. That would be quite a feather in your cap, wouldn't it?
RENAULT: It certainly would. Germany... Vichy would be very grateful.
RICK: Then release him. You be at my place a half hour before the plane leaves.
RICK: I'll arrange to have Laszlo come there to pick up the letters of transit, and that'll give you the criminal grounds on which to make the arrest. You get him, and we get away. To the Germans that last will be just a minor annoyance.
RENAULT: There's still something about this business I don't quite understand. Miss Lund, she's very beautiful, yes, but you were never interested in any woman.
RICK: Well, she isn't just any woman.
RENAULT: I see. How do I know you'll keep your end of the bargain?
RICK: I'll make the arrangements right now with Laszlo in the visitor's pen.
RENAULT: Ricky, I'm going to miss you. Apparently you're the only one in Casablanca who has even less scruples than I.
RICK: Oh, thanks.
RENAULT: Go ahead, Ricky.
