SYBOK: Spock, you've developed a sense of humor after all.
SPOCK: It was not my intention to amuse you. These are serious charges. However, if you surrender now-
SYBOK: I'm sorry, Spock. I can't surrender now. I'm not through violating Neutral Zone Treaty. In fact, I'm just getting started. And now for my next violation I intend to steal something. Something very big.
SYBOK: I must have your starship.
KIRK: You staged all this to get your hands on my ship?
SYBOK: Who are you?
KIRK: James T. Kirk, Captain of the Enterprise.
SYBOK: But I thought Captain Chekov.. I see. Very clever, Captain. Spock, it would appear that you've been given a second chance to join me. What do you say?
SPOCK: I am a Starfleet Officer.
SYBOK: Of course. Of course. Then I'll take the ship without your help.
SCOTTY: Shuttle en route.
CHEKOV: Position, Bird of Prey?
SCOTTY: Closing.
