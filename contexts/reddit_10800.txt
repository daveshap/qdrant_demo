stop trying to fucking guilt trip me
*“your family will be so distraught if you hurt yourself!!!”*

*”you have NO IDEA how much of an impact suicide will have on those around you!”*

*“imagine the reaction of your parents! imagine them reading the note! receiving the call!”*


....



wtf,,,, i know you have good intentions but *please*

is this really supposed to make me feel better? 

all it does is fill me with guilt,,, and fills me with the realization that i have to live in fucking pain until the day i die,,, or until everyone who “cares about me” will die.
