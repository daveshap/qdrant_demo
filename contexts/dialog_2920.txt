BETH: What is your problem? I'm trying to help you. Why won't you let me help you?
NICK: I don't need any help.
BETH: Yes you do. Something's on with you. You're sleeping with her, aren't you?
NICK: What is this interest you've got in her?
BETH: My interest is in you, not in her. She seduces people, she manipulates --
NICK: I thought you hardly know her.
BETH: I know the type. I'm a psychologist.
