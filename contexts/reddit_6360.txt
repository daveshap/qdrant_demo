Tell me about yourself
Apparently the most commonly asked job interview question is:
"Tell me about yourself"

Am I supposed to tell about my education and all of my skills that I have gained over time? Aint I supposed to highlight my skills in other questions such as, "Tell me about yours strengths" or "Why do you want to work for this position"?
