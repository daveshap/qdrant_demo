JOHNNY: Well, if that's the crop, that must be the gastric caecal...
CARMEN: Excuse me...!
JOHNNY: 35% on the math final ! No one could be that dumb with numbers.
CARMEN: Well, at least you didn't lose your lunch over a bug. How embarassing.
JOHNNY: Who cares about bugs ? You can't go anywhere if you don't know math.
CARMEN: Don't be so sure. I like you even if you are dumb with numbers.
JOHNNY: Then how come you won't hold hands with me at school ?
CARMEN: I don't want everyone to see.
JOHNNY: Why won't you kiss me when we're all alone ?
CARMEN: How come that's all you talk about anymore ?
JOHNNY: It's all I think about anymore.
CARMEN: You can't walk me home.
JOHNNY: Why not ?
CARMEN: I thought you were going to help Carl.
JOHNNY: Carl can wait.
CARMEN: Johnny, my Dad's home today.
JOHNNY: What's he got against me... I mean, I 'm a teenager. You can't be a citizen when you're only a teenager !
CARMEN: It's not you, Johnny. Your parents are rich they don't need to be citizens, and that stuff means a lot to my dad. He's a veteran.
JOHNNY: Well, if your dad doesn't like me, how come we're such good friends ?
CARMEN: Sometimes I do what I want, eh ?
CARL: Don't think about it... go on instinct.
JOHNNY: Ace of spades.
CARL: Statistically speaking you should've accidentally guessed right by know.
JOHNNY: In addition to psychic dolt" this test also proves I'm unlucky ? Two of hearts."
