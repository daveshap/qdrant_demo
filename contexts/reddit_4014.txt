Why is is so hard to find "the right one"
After being in a relationship for 5 years, I've been living the single life for 2 years. It's not as glamorous as some people make it seem. I feel my efforts to be myself have fallen short, but see so many happy couple who enjoy the same things I do. It's starting to get hard to put myself out there cause the results have been...slim so far. Dating sites are just awkward cause it almost always relies on the woman messaging first, or just not responding.

I'm a nerdy, geeky, kind of person, that enjoys cosplay, star wars, video games, and cons. I have found that in the 2 years of being single that finding a person who enjoys some of the same things that I do is extremely difficult.

I wish I had more time to attend cons and meet people, and but currently due to work can't. I cant seem to find the right "recipe."

I'm hoping someone can point me in the direction to meet/talk to women who enjoy the same things.

If you've made it this far thank you for reading.
