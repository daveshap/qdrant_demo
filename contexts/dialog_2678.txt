DELACROIX: You shouldn't even be mad at me over Sloan.
MANTAN: What you did is dead wrong.
DELACROIX: Oh, is it? Buddy boy, in this business if people don't produce, they get fired.
MANTAN: Sloan is the hardest working person I've ever met.
DELACROIX: Let me ask you a question, if I may. How do you think she got the job in the first place? I don't mean to burst your bubble, Mantan the Marvelous, but Sloan is an opportunity.
MANTAN: I don't believe it.
DELACROIX: Do I have to spell it out for you? In fact, go ask Sloan yourself.
MANTAN: How did you get this gig?
SLOAN: Worked my black ass off, first as an intern, then worked my way up to this position.
MANTAN: You leave something out?
SLOAN: After my internship expired, Dela was impressed and offered me a position as his assistant.
MANTAN: And?
SLOAN: And what?
MANTAN: Stop playing me Sloan.
SLOAN: Just ask me what you want to know.
MANTAN: Oh, you gonna make me say it.
SLOAN: Say what, Manray?
MANTAN: Did you ever sleep with DeLa?
SLOAN: We did it one time, only once. It had nothing to do with the job, it was stupid. Everything I've got I've earned.
MANTAN: Aw, c'mon.
SLOAN: That's ancient history. That has nothing to do with you and I.
MANTAN: So you say. Sloan, you wuz gonna use me up just like you used Dela? Work it to the top. I never imagined people in this biz could flip on you like IHOP." I'm damn happy DeLa fired ya ass."
SLOAN: Forget about me, are you a puppet for DeLa?
MANTAN: Don't try to change to the subject.
SLOAN: Why don't you answer?
MANTAN: I know I won't be your puppet.
SLOAN: You can go now.
MANTAN: I wuz leaving anyway, for good.
