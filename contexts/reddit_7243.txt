Leaving a job before training is over
In May I accepted a job offer. Seemed great! I needed a summer job and it had good pay, super flexible, meaningful work, everything I wanted! It was an entry level job so I wasn’t expecting training to be so dense.

As we’re entering June, I’m still going through online modules and more training. At this point I won’t see a paycheck until the end of June. I’m going through the money I have saved up and really can’t afford to keep waiting to start. I’ll get a minimal stipend at the end of training but after that I’m not sure when I’ll see a solid paycheck. 

Today I started looking for an escape route and started applying for different jobs. I got a call back immediately from a job that more so aligns with my career path. The person seemed very excited about my previous experience and wanted me to interview as soon as Friday. 

If the interview goes well and can start giving me hours soon, I’ll take that over the job I’m training for now. 

How would I go about quitting? I feel kinda bad for wasting their time especially since I really respect what the company does, but it just isn’t meeting my needs right now.
