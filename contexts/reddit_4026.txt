Am I too picky or am I unattractive?
I never get matches on Tinder or Bumble. To be fair, I swipe right quite rarely, but I'd expect to get the odd match here and there. In the past 8 months I've had one match on Bumble, who unmatched me before saying anything, and maybe 5 matches on Tinder, who didn't respond and subsequently unmatched. 

The thing is I generally think I'm physically attractive, but given my track record it would seem that I am not... I think I need to lower my standards, but even when I'm desperate I don't seem to be able to do that..

On a side note: Tinder says I have 2 likes. Is this accurate?? Two people on the entirety of Tinder in my radius have swiped me right??!! I'M A FIVE STAR MAN, DAMMIT!

EDIT: Ok folks. I have heard your resounding hatred of the bio and that shall be re-worked. I am definitely going to regret this, but for those asking, here is my first pic: [Pic](http://imgur.com/a/5EHWoEf)
