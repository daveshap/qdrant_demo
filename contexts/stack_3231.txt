Looking for a childrens/young adult book about children exploring the dark side of a moon This is a book I remember loving when I was young, but I can\u2019t remember the name of the book or the author. (I read it probably in the early 90's.)I remember it being about a girl and a young boy (who might have been her brother) living on a space station and somehow getting stranded on the dark side of a moon or planet. There were some alien animal things that everyone was terrified of that lived on the dark side, but I seem to remember the kids befriending some of them. Edited to add more stuff I think I remembered: I remember the alien animal things lived in a pack, and had piebald/mottled skin. They were considered to be dangerous and terrifying, but turned out to (I think) be telepathic or otherwise able to communicate.I don't remember how it ended, but I'm pretty sure there was more than one book.
