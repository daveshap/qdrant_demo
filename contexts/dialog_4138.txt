FRED: She's angry. It's all over the news.
GEORGE: Yeah. Listen. I'm going to be going away for awhile.
FRED: You're not going to trial?
GEORGE: No.
FRED: Good.
GEORGE: Give this to Mom, will you?
FRED: Money. You and your mother. All the time chasing it. I never understood it.
GEORGE: Give it to her, Dad. It'll make her happy.
FRED: Yeah, I know. This is it, isn't it?
GEORGE: Tell Mom, you know...
FRED: I'll tell her.
