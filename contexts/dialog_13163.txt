MAURA: Weird sounds, things moving, lights going off. The videotape...
WILL: So what are you saying?
MAURA: I don't know what I'm saying.
MAURA: But do you agree with me?
WILL: Yeah, I'd say some weird things have happened.
MAURA: Well what do you think it is?
WILL: Well, I try to keep an open mind, but...
MAURA: Maybe Eliza wasn't so crazy after all.
WILL: There's got to be an explanation. It could be a magnetic flux or something, maybe the power lines are giving off something. Who knows? I don't know, I think it's kind of interesting.
MAURA: Well what power lines, Will? Where? Maybe we should call someone about it.
WILL: Who?
MAURA: I don't know. Someone who...knows about this kind of stuff.
WILL: Oh come on!
MAURA: What about keeping an open mind?
WILL: Just because I have an open mind doesn't mean I'm going to pay some snake oil peddler to come in and shake a voodoo stick around the house.
MAURA: Voodoo stick? It's nothing like that Will. You're just being cynical.
WILL: I'm being realistic. Look, I have a spiritual side. I mean, we had a priest come in and bless the house. That should count for something.
