TREVES: WHERE IS MR. MERRICK?
NIGHT PORTER: I... I don't know what you mean, Sir.
TREVES: Don't lie to me. I know all about it. You were SEEN. Where did you take him?
NIGHT PORTER: Take him? Now wait... I didn't take him anywhere. We were just having some fun. We didn't hurt him... just having a laugh, that's all.
TREVES: HE'S GONE!
NIGHT PORTER: When I left him, he was in his bed, safe and sound.
TREVES: YOU BASTARD! You tortured him. YOU TORTURED HIM, you bastard. WHERE is HE?
NIGHT PORTER: YOU'RE NOT LISTENING TO ME! I ain't done nothing wrong. People pay to see your monster, Mr. Treves. I just take the money.
TREVES: YOU'RE THE MONSTER! YOU'RE THE FREAK! GET OUT! YOU'RE FINISHED!
