Certifications worth getting?
Right now I’m a bit lost in my life I tried being a CNA I hated it. I worked at a grocery store and although I enjoyed the people the job was shit. I worked front desk at a doctors office and that was far to negative for me, and with that I don’t just mean patients my coworkers as well. I don’t feel like wasting money going to school as I have no idea what I would even major in. I’m a creative person and I like to write, design and come up with ideas. Im also info technology like phones and computers but I feel like IT just isn’t for me at the moment unless it’s hands on and has nothing to do with coding. A lot of people say I’m a very outside the box thinker as well. I’m currently looking for a way to start building my life and possible a career but I don’t know what I want to do just yet. Is there any certifications worth getting that could help start a career rather than just another job. Sorry if this didn’t give enough info of what not as this my first time posting here.
