WELLES: Pittsburgh?
MRS CHRISTIAN: Mostly. That's where he started his empire building. He was a good man. Notorious as an eccentric, but that was something he cultivated. He wanted to be legendary.
WELLES: He succeeded.
MRS CHRISTIAN: We were married forty-five years. Hard even for me to imagine. We had our troubles. There were plenty of places for him to be other than here, but he was always loyal to me, and I to him. I loved him deeply.
MRS CHRISTIAN: Do you carry a gun, Mr. Welles?
WELLES: I wear a gun when I can tell a client expects me to. Other than that, there's never any reason.
MRS CHRISTIAN: Just curious.
MRS CHRISTIAN: My husband was the only one with the combination to this safe. I knew about it, but as far as I was concerned it was none of my business. Not till now, that is.
WELLES: You hired someone to open it. I'll bet the lawyer loved that.
MRS CHRISTIAN: There was nothing he could do. My husband left everything to me. I prevented anyone from seeing the contents. I felt these were my husband's private things. I didn't... I didn't realize...
WELLES: Do you want to tell me what you found?
MRS CHRISTIAN: Cash, stock certificates, and this...
MRS CHRISTIAN: It's a film... of a girl being murdered.
WELLES: I'm afraid I don't...
MRS CHRISTIAN: This is a movie showing a girl being murdered. She's sitting on a bed, and a man rapes her... and he begins to cut her with a knife... I only watched what I could.
MRS CHRISTIAN: I didn't know what to think. I can't tell you how horrible it's been, to know this belonged to my husband. To know that he watched this... this atrocity. But, I can't go to the police...
WELLES: Mrs. Christian... please, will you sit down a moment? I want you to listen carefully. What you're talking about is a snuff film." But
WELLES: Please, believe me. This is probably a stag film. Simulated rape. Hard to stomach, and it might seem real, but there are ways of making it look realistic... fake blood and special effects...
MRS CHRISTIAN: No.
WELLES: If you were to study it you'd see the camera cutting away... you'd see the tricks they can play...
MRS CHRISTIAN: I'm telling you it's not that.
WELLES: I'm sure it is. It's probably something your husband was given as a bad joke. More than likely he never even watched it.
MRS CHRISTIAN: Will you watch it and see for yourself?
WELLES: Of course. But, I'm certain it's nothing to worry about.
WELLES: You... you need to go to the police.
MRS CHRISTIAN: I told you I can't, not yet.
WELLES: You don't have any other choice.
MRS CHRISTIAN: No. For me to live with the ruin of my husband's name, I need know that whoever did this will be punished. If you can find them, I will take their names to the police. I'll say my husband confessed on his death bed. I'll say I didn't have courage to come forward at first...
WELLES: It won't work like that.
MRS CHRISTIAN: Any evidence you collect can be given to the police later, anonymously. I've thought about it and there's no other way. If you can't find them... if the only thing that comes from this film is that this is all my husband will be remembered for, well I can't let that happen. I'm telling you I won't. If there's no chance that poor girl's memory can be served, then I'll just have to spend my last days trying to forget her.
WELLES: I deal in divorce cases. Corporate investigations...
MRS CHRISTIAN: You've found missing persons before.
WELLES: Nothing remotely like this.
MRS CHRISTIAN: I know what I'm asking. Your compensation will be appropriate to the risk. You'll need cash to buy information, and I'll provide it. I feel responsible, Mr. Welles. You saw what he did to her.
WELLES: This is the mortgage. This is Cindy's college money.
AMY: I understand.
WELLES: Sometimes you can't know what I'm doing. It's better that way.
AMY: I know.
WELLES: It's a missing persons case... a long shot. I'll give it two months, two months at most, then I'll be back. We'll take a vacation.
AMY: Why the gun?
WELLES: I'm not gonna need it. I won't even wear it. It's a precaution. Don't worry about me.
