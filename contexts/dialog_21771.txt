TOMMY: How's the weight? Ok?
JAKE: Yeah, the weight's Ok.
TOMMY: All right, lemme ask you something. Let's say I was a good friend of yours. And I was telling you I was gonna bet a lot of money on you in this Janiro fight. What would you tell me?
JAKE: I'd tell you to bet a bundle.
JAKE: Vickie?... Vickie, you asleep?
VICKIE: What?
JAKE: You asleep?
VICKIE: Yeah.
JAKE: Huh?
VICKIE: Yeah, what?
JAKE: Tell me, you think of anybody else when I'm making love to you?
VICKIE: Nobody. I love you, remember?
JAKE: Then why'd you say that thing about Tony Janiro?
VICKIE: What did I say?
JAKE: That he's got a pretty face.
VICKIE: I never noticed his face.
JAKE: You sure you're not thinking of him right now?
VICKIE: Positive.
JAKE: You're the one who said he was good looking. You think he's good looking 'cause I know you think he's good- looking. I'll smash his face inside out. I'll make him into dog meat. Nobody's gonna think he's good-looking when I get through with him. So you just go ahead and think about who you want.
