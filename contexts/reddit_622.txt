It is possible to get over this type of rejection?
So what happened, i like one girl but she was trying to hook me with her cousin because she had feelings for me. One day she told me over text during casual conversation that she liked someone. But I don’t why my stupid ass next day texted her that i want to meet her so we decided to meet after her work,

But when i told her that i have feeling for you. she was like i told you that i like someone else and you are still asking me. And she was like i am sorry.

while leaving she said you are joking, right. I don’t know why i was like it was a prank and i had an bet with my friends that i had to ask one of my close friends?

But now i am feeling like first, i got rejected and second i even made a joke of myself by saying it was a prank now i am feeling like stupidest person in the world and pretty sure she is thinking the dame too cuz she is not even replying to my texts.

I don’t know what to fo anymore ☹️.
