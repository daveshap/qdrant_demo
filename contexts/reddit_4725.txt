i think my friend is about to give up, and she is distancing herself from the people that can help
so i have this friend,
she is my best friend,
she has depression and is in a real bad spot right now.

we both finished high school last year,
and she thinks she is driffiting away from our friend group,
yesterday she blocked all of us on twitter,
i think i am the only one that noticed so far,
and she has been saying things like, "no one can help me", or "i don't think they like me" and "i feel nothing for them",
i am trying to convince her that it isn't true, that they do like her, because i know they do.

i have always been doing the most that i can,
trying to be supportive and saying stuff like, "i am here if you need" and things like that,
but it isn't as effective because i am currently living in the other side of the planet for my studies,
(we are both brazilians but i am doing an exchange program in canada, if you care)
after i confirmed that she blocked all of us, i told the situation to 2 other close friends of her, and they didn't know how bad she was until now.

so i'll just ask a few questions to anyone that cares to answer:
did i do the right thing telling the situation to other people??
is there anything else that i can do??
is there a dedicated sub for people that aren't depressed but want to help friends that are??

sorry for the formating and spelling mistakes, english is not my first language, i am on mobile and i am feeling a little bit desperate about the whole situation.
