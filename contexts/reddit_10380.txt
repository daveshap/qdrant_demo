Im going to kill myself in few hours .
There is no other way anymore I have lied and been an idiot and a failure for my entire life . There is no turning back anymore and nothing can fix this . There really is no fixing this . 

Im 19 years old fucked up my entire life I have mutilated my body and ruined my life by letting my mental health detiorate till I ented up being trapped in my lies. Its been years . 
I have been depressed my entire life , on top of that i have dysphoria and purge often . 
Im going to clean my room and get rid of my stuff . Once its dark im going for a walk and will overdose on pills and vodka and stil my wrist or maybe ill go and get a rope either way today is the day .  
I dont know why im posting this . 
Ive been in pain for years i feel so empty and wrong and evil and have felt like that my entire life .  I need someone to know  so im posting it here .

Edit: 
Thank all of you for reaching out . I wish the best for you all . Ive cleaned my room left a note and visited a friend im going to my (hopelly ) final  destination now , thanks and good luck in life.
