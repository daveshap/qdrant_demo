RIZZO: What's that?
BOEMAN: THat's the sound of deep space attacking the integrity of the ship.
KAY-EM 14: No... That's the sound of the men working on the chain gang.
RIZZO: Are there any other shuttles?
JANESSA: No.
RIZZO: Teleportation? Some way to beam us the hell out of dodge?
THORGAN: You read a lot of Science Fiction didn't you?
JANESSA: A little late to be thinking about escape, isn't it?
KAY-EM 14: I'll never experience my fantasy of three sex droids, two humans, and a Knofflapod. Damn.
THORGAN: Am I in there?
KAY-EM 14: Sory...
RIZZO: Hey.
DELONGPRE: That's a good fantasy, though. Kinky, but good.
RIZZO: Hey!!
RIZZO: What's this?
DELONGPRE: It's the engine, reactors, audiometers, it's the stuff that makes the ship go zoom.
RIZZO: Can we get through these?
THORGAN: Sure but what good will that do?
BOEMAN: When the left hull goes, so will the right.
RIZZO: What if we blow the walkways first? Leave Jason over here to go up with the ship?
