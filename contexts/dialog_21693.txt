CLEANTE: Marquis? Is that you?
THE MARQUIS: For fuck's sake, who else would it be? The witching hour's arrived; you've alerted the others, yes?
CLEANTE: I'm no longer a man! I awoke to discover I'd turned into a sparrow!
THE MARQUIS: Yes, well, I awoke to discover I'd turned into a cat. If you don't do as I say, I'll sink my little fangs into your drumsticks, and suck the marrow straight out of your bones.
CLEANTE: At your service, Count.
THE MARQUIS: Now give the signal.
