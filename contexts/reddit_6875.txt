Just got laid off, did not see it coming, what is the next step?
I have another meeting in a half an hour with my boss to go over severance and potential internal positions I can apply to. I have been an amazing employee (promoted last year, rave reviews from everyone). Lay off isnâ€™t performance related....

Any advice on how to go forward and how to act in the meeting?
