JESSICA: Hi.
HARRY: Well I hope the carpet matches the drapes.
JESSICA: Excuse me.
HARRY: In the new library there.
JESSICA: Oh, yeah. I don't think they do. You're new here, right?
HARRY: Depends how you define 'new'...
JESSICA: You're the kid who was home schooled.
HARRY: Yeah. How'd you know?
JESSICA: I've been assigned to write an article about you for the school paper. It was either a feature on you or the new four-color ink pens at the student store.
HARRY: Four colors? Neato!
JESSICA: Yeah, well, I'd much rather write an expose or a hard hitting investigative piece, but nothing really ever happens around here. But, I chose you and that's fine. I'm Jessica Matthews.
HARRY: HARRY Dunne.
