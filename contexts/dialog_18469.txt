MORROW: Say fellow, you neglected me - and I feel very put out. Look, sock it right there, will you? Lay one right on the button,[6] but sock it hard.
LONGFELLOW: That's all right. I got it off my chest.
MORROW: The difference between them and me is I know when I've been a skunk. You take me to the nearest news- stand and I'll eat a pack of your postcards raw. Raw!
MORROW: Oh, what a magnificent deflation of smugness. Pal, you've added ten years to my life! A poet with a straight left and a right hook - delicious! Delicious! You're my guest from now on - forever and a day - even unto eternity!
LONGFELLOW: Thanks, but Miss Dawson and I are going out to see the sights.
MORROW: Fine, fine. Swell, You just showed me a sight lovely to behold, and I'd like to reciprocate. Listen, you hop aboard my magic carpet— —thanks - and I'll show you sights that you've never seen before.
LONGFELLOW: I'd kind of like to see Grant's Tomb - and the Statue of Liberty.
MORROW: Well, you'll not only see those, but before the evening's half through, you'll be leaning against the Leaning Tower of Pisa - you'll mount Mt. Everest. I'll show you the Pyramids and all the little Pyramiddes, leaping from sphinx to sphinx. Pal, how would you like to go on a real, old-fashioned binge?
LONGFELLOW: Binge?
MORROW: Yes. I mean the real McCoy. Listen, you play saloon with me, and I'll introduce you to every wit, every nit-wit, and every half-wit in New York. We'll go on a twister that'll make Omar the soused philosopher of Persia[7] look like an anemic on a goat's milk diet.
LONGFELLOW: That ought to be fun.
MORROW: Fun? Say, listen, I'll take you on a bender that will live in your memory as a thing of beauty and joy forever. Boy! Boy! My headpiece!
