MARANZANO: Mussolini is raping Sicily like every Roman before him. So our brothers are coming to America. Soldiers willing to fight and die. Men who know the meaning of honor.
LUCIANO: Don, you talk about honor, but you mean vendetta. Killin' an' more killin' until nobody can remember how it all started.
MARANZANO: And how many soldiers do you have?
LUCIANO: I've got friends.
MARANZANO: I have six hundred. Soldiers. And more every week off the boat.
LUCIANO: An' Masseria's got seven hundred.
MARANZANO: He's an animal!
LUCIANO: He's the Boss of all the Bosses, and I respect him.
