MERLIN: At your service, sir.
ARTHUR: Then answer me this. For years peace has reigned in the land. Crops grow in abundance, there is no want. Every one of my subjects enjoys his portion of happiness and justice, even those whose tiresome misunderstandings we must resolve here each day. Tell me, Merlin: have we defeated evil, as it seems?
MERLIN: Good and evil; there is never one without the other.
ARTHUR: Where hides evil, then, in my kingdom?
MERLIN: Never where you expect it, that's all I know.
