Overwhelmed, clutching at straws and losing control of my life...
I don't know why I am even typing this, but I am.  I can't say how I feel because I feel more numb than anything, but this is my status:

&#x200B;

I have become so overwhelmed this fortnight, and my head is a hurricane of thoughts that I can't pinpoint so cannot focus on anything.

&#x200B;

Everything is  a struggle and I am behind in work, house chores, personal hygiene and spending time with my fiance.

&#x200B;

Knowing I am behind is just causing the pressure on my shoulders to increase and is shutting me down even more.

&#x200B;

I have no purpose, I don't enjoy my work, my life rotates around trying to pay for the house and bills each month.  My only goal in my life has been to have kids, but I am 31 this year and overweight and it's just not happening.  I feel like I have no right to be a mother when I get like this and it makes me so anxious that I will never be a fit a parent.  

&#x200B;

I have been with my fiance for 11 years but I feel like I am causing problems because I just can't do things that I should be able to - he has to do all the chores, the cooking and nag me to do basic things like clean my teeth which is so embarrassing for me.

&#x200B;

I don't want to go back on anti-depressants because we are trying for a baby, and I feel to embarrassed to go back to my therapist because I have lost my fight, and depression has knocked me down again.

&#x200B;

I am self-employed and losing the will to do the work which means I don't get paid which adds to the stress of paying for the bills etc.

&#x200B;

...I know I am the only person to sort myself out. I know I can't get an instant "cure" for this, and I know what the practical and realistic answer is to my next question but I will ask it anyway because it is on my mind and I don't have anyone else to ask it towards...

Have you ever had the strength to just up sticks and start fresh somewhere new to give your head a new start?  I'm not talking about leaving my partner, but more my house and work to move somewhere new.

&#x200B;

...it wont matter though, will it?  Because depression is inside you, not around you and until you figure it out yourself you will never escape.

I really hate having depression.
