Just joined a dating app. Why do girls always say that “they are bored or not looking for anything”.
Just made an online dating profile. So far every girl I’ve met asks me my intentions and I tell them that I’m interested in dating. They seem to always come back with the response along the lines of “lol I’m on here because I’m bored”. I feel that there are so many other things to do if you are bored though.
