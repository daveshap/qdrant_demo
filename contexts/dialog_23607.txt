JILL: Why don't you ask for another one?
POPE: Are you kidding? His hair's probably the most nutritious thing in here. See, you've reduced me to eating weeds.
JILL: ... my friend doesn't like it here either.
POPE: All right, forget this filth. Continue about your friend.
JILL: Well he's not exactly a friend.
POPE: Is he an enemy?
JILL: Of course not... he's sort of a boyfriend.
POPE: -- sort of a boyfriend?
JILL: Sort of.
POPE: I see. You mean he just sort of fucks you.
JILL: Johnny!
POPE: My God, did I say that? I don't believe it.
POPE: I'm terribly sorry.
JILL: -- never mind.
POPE: What does he do? Is he an actor?
JILL: -- no.
POPE: Good for you.
JILL: He's a hairdresser.
POPE: -- oh, sure. A hairdresser. How... how do you a... meet a hairdresser?
JILL: Getting your hair done... Would you like to go to a party?
POPE: Not with your hairdresser.
