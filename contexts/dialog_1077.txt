DEEP THROAT: I saw the flag signal--what's up?
WOODWARD: Nothing, that's the problem--the story's gone underground.
DEEP THROAT: You thought I'd help out on specifics? I'll confirm what you get, try to keep you on the right track, but that's all. Are you guys really working? How much?
WOODWARD: I don't know maybe sixteen, eighteen hours a day--we've got sources at Justice, the FBI, but it's still drying up.
DEEP THROAT: Then there must be something, mustn't there. Look, forget the myths the media's created about the White House-- the truth is, these are not very bright guys, and things got out of hand.
WOODWARD: If you don't like them, why won't you be more concrete with me?
DEEP THROAT: Because the press stinks too--history on the run, that's all you're interested in. You come up with anything?
WOODWARD: John Mitchell resigned as head of CREEP to spend more time with his family. That doesn't exactly have the ring of truth. Howard Hunt's been found--there was talk that his lawyer had 25 thousand in cash in a paper bag.
DEEP THROAT: Follow the money. Always follow the money.
WOODWARD: To where?
DEEP THROAT: Go on.
WOODWARD: This man Gordon Liddy--he's going to be tried along with Hunt and the five burglars--we know he knows a lot, we just don't know what.
DEEP THROAT: You changed cabs? You're sure no one followed you?
WOODWARD: I did everything you said, but it all seemed--
DEEP THROAT: --melodramatic? Things are past that--remember, these are men with switchblade mentalities who run the world as if it were Dodge City.
WOODWARD: What's the whole thing about--do you know?
DEEP THROAT: What I know, you'll have to find out on your own.
WOODWARD: Liddy--you think there's a chance he'll talk?
DEEP THROAT: Talk? Once, at a gathering, he put his hand over a candle. And he kept it there. He kept it right in the flame until his flesh seared. A woman who was watching asked, What's the trick?" And he replied. "The trick is not minding.""
BERNSTEIN: What's that?
WOODWARD: The fucking New York Times.
BERNSTEIN: Goddamnit--
WOODWARD: --see?--
BERNSTEIN: --I'm trying--
WOODWARD: --fifteen phone calls--
BERNSTEIN: ---fifteen or more phone calls from the burglars in Miami to Gordon Liddy at CREEP--
WOODWARD: Why didn't we get that?
BERNSTEIN: Christ, and I even know somebody at the phone company--
WOODWARD: --you do?--with access to records?
BERNSTEIN: Why couldn't you have just dialed me from the office, Irwin?
IRWIN: 'Cause I'm not calling out from the phone company anymore-- --I think the place is bugged.
BERNSTEIN: So tell me about the Times article.
IRWIN: What do you want to know?
BERNSTEIN: No games, Irwin; give.
IRWIN: My big civil rights buddy-- --boy, if John Mitchell was after your phone records, would you be screaming. What're you onto?
BERNSTEIN: Something maybe big.
IRWIN: And that makes anything you do OK, is that it?
BERNSTEIN: Just tell me about the goddamn article.
IRWIN: It was accurate, but I can't get a fuller listing for you--all Barker's phone records have been subpoenaed.
BERNSTEIN: Who by?
IRWIN: A Miami D.A. The guy doing the investigating is named Martin Dardis.
BERNSTEIN: Irwin? I really feel bad, doing something like this--you know that, don't you?
