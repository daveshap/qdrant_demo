Term for when someone falsely accuses another of misdeeds that they are actually guilty of themselves This is similar to a previous question (... accuses another of doing something which they did ...) but more generalized. Two examples:A German woman athlete falsely accused other women athletes of being men; it transpired that she was a man. Similarly, Trump repeatedly called Clinton \"Crooked Hillary.\" Who was the real crook? In my personal experience, this is a very common phenomenon. One suggestion was \"Projecting.\" Does this imply deflection?  One conclusion to the original question was that a new word needed to be coined. I propose the word \"Gasblagging.\" (see Gaslighting and Blagging.)
