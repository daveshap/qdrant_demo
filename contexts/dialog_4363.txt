PEARL: Left hand's the past. Your right's the present. And the future. But it's not written in stone. It's written in flesh and blood. And flesh and blood will change. See? There's something here, a new line, right across your life line.
BONES: Must be my clothes line. No? How bout my phone line?
PEARL: No baby. I'm serious. Cancel that meeting. I got more fruit that needs checking. Come home with me now.
BONES: Don't you worry about a thing. This hand's gonna be stroking the back of your neck tonight.
