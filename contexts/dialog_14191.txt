GEORGE: Got a match?
HARRY: Very funny. Very funny.
MOTHER: Put those things in the car and I'll get your tie and studs together.
HARRY: Okay, Mom. You coming later? You coming later, George?
GEORGE: What do you mean, and be bored to death?
HARRY: Couldn't want a better death. Lots of pretty girls, and we're going to use that new floor of yours tonight, too.
GEORGE: I hope it works.
