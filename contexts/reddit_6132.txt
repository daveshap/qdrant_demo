Under what circumstances would you ask (or hint at) a supervisor about a bonus?
I work in the investment industry and as you may know, people are going crazy over the markets. Our whole team of operations has been non stop working our asses off, and we know the company is raking in the cash during this pandemic. I personally have taken on two of the task that have seen the most inflow of work. They sent out an email about how great the company is doing during these hard times. I’m pretty tempted to jokingly bring up bonuses to my supervisor just to see his reaction. We’re on good enough terms that nothing negative would come of it. 

Have any of you asked your boss or supervisor for a bonus?
