PUFF: My apologies, madam.
LILA: It's okay, Puff.
PUFF: Shan't happen again.
NATHAN: This is great, Puff. You're doing fine.
PUFF: I'm loving this. It's such a treat to be out and about. What a wonderful invention a city is. The immense buildings of glass and steel glinting in the afternoon sun, the smartly dressed women in their best summer frocks, the colorful street vendors.
