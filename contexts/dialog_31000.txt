PRINCIPAL MERKIN: I like you, Ted. You know that. I liked you before you were filthy rich.
TED: Thanks, Principal Merkin.
PRINCIPAL MERKIN: I'll be blunt. I know you can take it.
TED: Yes, sir. I'll brace myself.
PRINCIPAL MERKIN: Ted, you are the best editor this school paper ever had. You don't need to be pandering flesh. It's nonsense. It's beneath you.
TED: You think I ought to just tell them thanks but no thanks? I don't want your silly billion dollar empire?
PRINCIPAL MERKIN: That's a good start, yes. A very good start.
TED: Are you kidding? This magazine is my dream. It's every red-blooded, heterosexual male's dream.
PRINCIPAL MERKIN: I never figured you for a pimp.
TED: Have you ever even looked at Heaven?""
PRINCIPAL MERKIN: What kind of sick question is that? I'll be watching you, young man. Your money and power mean nothing here. Nothing.
TED: I guess you won't be wanting that Rolex I sent you, then?
