Most optimum way to use ice on long corridors? I've been working on a survival map for a while, and right yesterday got my ice farm.So the fact is that I want to use this ice to move faster between portals in nether, but also at some places in overworld. My corridors are 2*2, but I have to hold me to use everything as packed ice because it will take for ages for me to fill those corridors, even if I do it in 1 side of the 2 they have.So how do I have to difference between packed ice and normal ice at nether and overworld? Do trap doors help when holding light away from ice blocks?
