WHALE: Oh, of course. Clayton. You finished your shower already?
CLAY: Ten minutes ago. Didn't you hear me calling?
WHALE: I'm afraid not. Terribly sorry. I believe I promised you some clothes.
WHALE: You're much wider than I am. You won't want to attempt to get into my pants.
CLAY: No. Definitely not.
