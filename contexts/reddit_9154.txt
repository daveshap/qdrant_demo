Paid off 22k in debt, credit score up 150+ points... relieved is an understatement. You can do this.
I posted a while ago when we were at the halfway mark of paying off our debt. Today I finally made the last big payment. We are officially debt free. We had 22k in CC debt in January of this year. It’s been hard to see almost all of your hard earned money go toward those balances but I am SO relieved. My credit score has gone up significantly. We have a little money in our savings account. We can maybe even start thinking about buying a house in the next year or two. 

I had no idea how much the stress of CC debt was affecting me emotionally and physically. Thank you to the tips and tricks and also just support of this sub - it’s HUGE to know you aren’t alone.  Next mountain is student loan debt (20k) and our car (7k)....
