RAJA: Twenty years ago all the major hoodlums of this city were united into one great brotherhood of evil, and Casanova was their king.
SHOVELER: Crime was rampant. It wasn't safe to stay in your home.
BOWLER: Much less go outside.
SHOVELER: Then Captain Amazing appeared.
RAJA: He busted Casanova and sent the crooks packing.
SHOVELER: And this has been a pretty nice place to live ever since.
FURIOUS: But now Casanova's back! And we're gonna sit around here all night eating pizza and telling stories! Hey, lets toast some marshmellows!
SPHINX: The wise snake coils before he strikes.
FURIOUS: And a skunk stinks!
SPHINX: You drink too much.
FURIOUS: When are you going to take off that mask?
SPHINX: When I am sure I am among friends.
RAJA: Roy --
FURIOUS: Go dance with your mother, Jeffrey!
SPHINX: Your rage is a very great power, but it blinds you to your heart.
FURIOUS: My heart died a long time ago.
SPHINX: It is not dead. It is hiding.
FURIOUS: Blow it out your bean hole, Pancho!... And to hell with the rest of you!... Look at you. Bunch of rejects. I didn't need you before -- and I don't need you now! The great ones RIDE ALONE! Adios, muchachos!
