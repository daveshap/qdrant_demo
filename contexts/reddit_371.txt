Addicted to Social Media
I often feel the need to post and update my feed. I run a page with a mix of topics: memes, art, selfies, photography, etc. I find myself feeling incredibly sad when someone unfollows me. It doesn't matter if they know me or not. I get sad. Same goes for when a post doesn't get as many likes as the recent one. What should I do?
