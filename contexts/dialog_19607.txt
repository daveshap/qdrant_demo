NEIL: You're late.
NANCY: Didn't get much sleep.
NEIL: Well, we've got --
NANCY: Max, where's Kristen?
MAX: She's been waiting outside your office since breakfast.
NANCY: I used to live in this house.
KRISTEN: But...it's just a house I've dreamed about. I dream about it all the time. Thank you for what you did last night.
NANCY: Have you ever done that before? Pulled someone into your dream?
KRISTEN: When I was a little girl. Three or four. If I had a nightmare, I'd bring my Dad in. The dream would always get better. He always used to tell me about it the next day -- he used to think they were his dreams. NANCY When did it stop?
KRISTEN: When I was still a kid. My folks got divorced. After a while, I thought I'd imagined the whole thing. I guess I didn't.
NANCY: It's an amazing gift.
KRISTEN: That man in my dreams. He's real isn't he?
NANCY: He's real.
NEIL: Okay, Group's in session. Straight talk only in this room.
