Replugging network cable doesn't reconnect I am using ubuntu 18.04. when I start my laptop and plug a network cable it will connect. But when I unplug the cable and then replug it won't reconnect. I have to then put the laptop in sleep mode and then it will reconnect. That means between 2 suspends the laptop will connect to the LAN port only once. If it is unplugged then make it sleep, wake up and then replug. I have figured out the problem is happening due to the installation of tlp. As soon as I install tlp this problem shows up and uninstalling it makes everything just fine.Please note that I am talking about the LAN port and not the port which we use for pendrives for file transfer.Also the problem doesn't show up in windows 10 as my laptop is dual booted
