Free handouts to preferred customers?
Can the owner of a small bakery give out free things (a cookie, a bread roll, etc.) to customers that they want to return? Like if someone comes in weekly and is really nice each time or leaves good tips for staff, can we return that with occasional free gifts, but not *offer* it to everyone? If they ask about it we would be prepared to give it, but we don't have to introduce it to rude customers? I'm honestly not sure if that would fall under discrimination or if that's appropriate.

TL:DR - It's not that long of a question, go back up and read it.
