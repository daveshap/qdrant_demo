Is it possible to kill Iskatu in Adventure Mode? I did most of the hardcore achievements in Adventure Mode and never bothered with story. However, I cannot find Iskatu boss there. I've noticed that in Act III there is cursed chest which spawns Ghom. Is there some similar event to summon Iskatu? Is there any other way to fight him without doing story mode?
