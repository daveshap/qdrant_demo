Configuring Siri to tell me the things I want to know in the morning Is there a way for me to configure my MacBook or iPhone so that Siri will tell me my schedule for the day and other relevant information I want to know (like what the weather will be for the day) without having to ask multiple questions?Ideally, I could just say \"Siri, tell me the plan for the day\" and she would respond with something like \"You have a meeting from 2-3 and 4-4:15. It is going to be rainy today with highs in the upper 70s.\"
