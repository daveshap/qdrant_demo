RAMÓN: Don't horse me. Price of zinc's never been higher. They don't want no strike -- not with their war boom on.
FRANK: Then why's the company hanging tough? They've signed contracts with other locals -- why not this one?
RAMÓN: Because most of us here are Mexican- Americans! Because we want equality with Anglo miners -- the same pay, the same conditions.
FRANK: Exactly. And equality's the one thing the bosses can't afford. The biggest club they have over the Anglo locals is, Well -- at least you get more than the Mexicans.""
RAMÓN: Okay, so discrimination hurts the Anglo too, but it hurts me more. And I've had enough of it!
SAL: But you don't pull a strike when the bosses want it -- so they can smash your union. You wait till you're ready, so you can win.
RAMÓN: Do the bosses wait? No sanitation. So my kids get sick. Does the company doctor wait? Twenty bucks. So we miss one payment on the radio I bought for my wife. Does the company store wait? Pay -- or we take it away." Why they in such a hurry
