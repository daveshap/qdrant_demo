JACKIE: You gain weight?
MAX: Ten pounds. I lose it and put it back on.
JACKIE: That's why I don't quit. If I can't fly anymore, I'm gonna have a bitch of a time gettin' my brand.
MAX: What's your brand?
JACKIE: Davidoffs. I get 'em in Mexico. They're hard to find here. I was locked up with the last two getting legal advice from a woman who was in for bustin' her boyfriend's head open with a baseball bat.
MAX: Was she helpful?
JACKIE: She was more helpful than the fuckin' Public Defender. I don't know -- I guess what I need is a lawyer, find out what my options are.
MAX: You know, I figured out the other day I've written something like fifteen thousand bonds since I've been in the business. I'd say about eighty percent of them were at least drug related. If you want, I can help you look at your options.
JACKIE: You're not tired of it?
MAX: I am, as a matter of fact.
MAX: What have they told you?
JACKIE: So far I've been told I can cooperate and get probation, maybe. Or, I can stand mute and get as much as five years. Does that sound right?
MAX: I'd say if you're tried and found guilty you won't get more than a year and a day. That's State time. Prison.
JACKIE: Shit.
MAX: But they won't want to take you to trial. They'll offer you simple Possession, a few months of County time, and a year or two probation. How 'bout another?
JACKIE: Sure.
MAX: You know who put the dope in your bag?
JACKIE: Yeah, but that's not what this was about. They were fuckin waitin' for my ass. They knew I had that money, they even knew the amount. The one who searched my bag, from L.A.P.D., Dargus, hardly even looked at it. Oh
MAX: They wanted you to tell them what you know.
JACKIE: I had 'em too. I burnt those two Starky and Hutch motherfuckers down. Then their asses lucked out and found that coke.
MAX: What did they want to know?
JACKIE: Who gave me the money and who I was giving it to. And some guy they found in a trunk with his head blown off. Said it was him who told them 'bout me.
