When is bootstrapping helpful and used? When is bootstrapping helpful and when should it be used? I have watched several videos so I understand what bootstrapping does (samples with replacement from a single sample many times and create a bootstrapped sampling distribution). If we are interested in means or difference in means, I understand that a t-test can be used and bootstrapping should be used for more unusual measures like medians (eg. median home price) or proportions (eg. proportion of voters that vote for a given party). To pinpoint why exactly bootstrapping is used for these cases, is it because a t-distribution does not accurately capture the distribution of the median home prices or proportion of voters? I have seen examples that use hypothesis testing and CIs for a proportion without using bootstrapping, so I wanted to clarify my understanding of why and when to use it.
