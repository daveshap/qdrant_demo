Can I collect unemployment insurance in California if I turn down a job in Canada?
My employer was acquired and the new company has eliminated my position in the restructuring. However I'm being considered for a different position in Canada at the new company. If they give me an offer and I turn it down will I still be able to collect unemployment insurance? The new position would require relocating far away from where I currently live.
