I accepted a job I don't know if I'm 100% qualified for. Besides working my ass off, what should I focus on?
About the position:

* It's an hourly paying job.
* It is something in my career that I went to school for and it's the third position I've had in my career. 
* In the last jobs I had doing this type of work, I worked with a team of people. At this job I'm the only one. 

Some extra info. I was working for the past three years on the east coast doing video production for a non-profit until I was laid off. I've been without a video job for the past year and have been working doing freelancing and for restaurants in the mean-time. I start there this next week and just stressed and a tad worried about it.
