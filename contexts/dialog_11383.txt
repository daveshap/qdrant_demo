BEN: Oh my God.
MRS. ROBINSON: Pardon?
BEN: Oh no, Mrs. Robinson, oh no.
MRS. ROBINSON: What's wrong?
BEN: Mrs. Robinson, you didn't -- I mean you didn't expect --
MRS. ROBINSON: What?
BEN: I mean -- you didn't really think that I would do something like that.
MRS. ROBINSON: Like what?
BEN: What do you think?
MRS. ROBINSON: Well I don't know.
BEN: For God's sake, Mrs. Robinson, here we are, you've got me into your house. You give me a drink. You put on music, now you start opening up your personal life to me and tell me your husband won't be home for hours.
MRS. ROBINSON: So?
BEN: Mrs. Robinson -- you are trying to seduce me.
BEN: Aren't you?
MRS. ROBINSON: Why no. I hadn't thought of it. I feel rather flattered that you --
BEN: Mrs. Robinson, will you forgive me for what I just said?
MRS. ROBINSON: It's all right.
BEN: It's not all right, it's the worst thing I've ever said to anyone.
MRS. ROBINSON: Sit down.
BEN: Please forgive me. Because I like you. I don't think of you that way. But I'm mixed up.
MRS. ROBINSON: All right. Now finish your drink.
BEN: Mrs. Robinson, it makes me sick that I said that to you.
MRS. ROBINSON: We'll forget it right now. Finish your drink.
BEN: What is wrong with me?
MRS. ROBINSON: Have you ever seen Elaine's portrait?
BEN: Her portrait?
MRS. ROBINSON: Yes.
BEN: No.
MRS. ROBINSON: We had it done last Christmas. Would you like to see it?
BEN: Very much.
