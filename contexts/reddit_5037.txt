How do I get around the issue of lack of experience?
I recently quit my 2 and a 1/2 yr job as a Sales Consultant due to the company I worked for changing ownership, and the new contract offering reduced hours and pay rate. I have qualifications in IT and Financial Services, but none of the Administration or Sales positions I have applied for have lead to interviews or even a simple 'get to know you' phone call. I feel it may be my lack of experience, but I am the type of person who learns very fast and have an IQ of 132. How do I convey my determination to succeed and finally get to the interview stage? Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks :)
