LEONARD: Why are you here?
TEDDY: You called me. You wanted my help. You know, Lenny, I've had more rewarding friendships than this one. Although I do get to keep using the same jokes.
LEONARD: You don't know him?
TEDDY: No! Should I?
LEONARD: I don't think so.
TEDDY: Think so? You don't know? Didn't you write it down?
LEONARD: I might have fallen asleep before I did.
