FLETCH: 'Mr. Stanwyk, of Provo, Utah, is a former commercial pilot.'
LARRY: Married Boyd Aviation. He's no dummy, that's serious coin.
FLETCH: 'Stanwyk's parents, Marvin and Velma Stanwyk, also of Provo, were unable to attend the wedding.'
LARRY: Not our kind of people, you understand.
FLETCH: Spot right here.
FLETCH: Thanks.
LARRY: You doing a story on this guy?
FLETCH: Maybe.
FLETCH: '...Stanwyk, blahblahblah, with internist Doctor Joseph Dolen.'
FLETCH: I wonder if that's his doctor.
LARRY: Only one way to find out.
DR. DOLEN: So where do you know Alan from?
FLETCH: We play tennis at the club.
DR. DOLEN: Really. The California Racquet Club?
FLETCH: Yes.
DR. DOLEN: That's my club too. I haven't seen you there.
FLETCH: Well, I haven't played in a while because of these kidney pains.
DR. DOLEN: Right, and how long have you had these pains, Mr. Barber?
FLETCH: That's Babar.
DR. DOLEN: Two bs?
FLETCH: One. B-a-b-a-r.
DR. DOLEN: That's two.
FLETCH: But not right next to each other. I thought that's what you meant.
DR. DOLEN: Arnold Babar. Isn't there a children's book about an elephant named Babar?
FLETCH: I don't know. I don't have any.
DR. DOLEN: No children?
FLETCH: No books. No elephants either. No really good elephant books.
DR. DOLEN: Still, it'd an odd name. I don't remember seeing it on the club registry.
FLETCH: Oh, I don't belong formally. I've gone with my aunt.
DR. DOLEN: Your aunt?
FLETCH: Mrs. Smith.
DR. DOLEN: Joan or Margaret Smith.
FLETCH: Right.
DR. DOLEN: Well, which one?
FLETCH: Margaret.
DR. DOLEN: Funny old bird.
FLETCH: Is she ever. I've got some stories....
DR. DOLEN: I'll bet. Shame about Ed.
FLETCH: It was. Really a shame. To go so suddenly.
DR. DOLEN: Oh, he was dying for years.
FLETCH: Sure, but the end was so sudden.
DR. DOLEN: He was in intensive care for eight weeks.
FLETCH: Yes, but the very end, when he actually died, that was extremely sudden. You know, Alan and I were recently speaking of dying. Told me Boyd Aviation took out a lot of insurance on him. You must have to be in some kind of perfect health to get that kind of policy.
DR. DOLEN: Bend over and drop your pants, Mr. Babar.
FLETCH: Oh really, there's no need to -- we don't want to do that...
DR. DOLEN: Just relax....
FLETCH: Honest, I feel fine. You better be married.
FLETCH: Did I say 'kidneys'? I meant my ear. Maybe I should see an ear dahhh -- Ever serve time?
DR. DOLEN: Breathe easy...
FLETCH: Anyway, I'm surprised Alan got the policy so easily. I know there's a history of cancer in the family.
DR. DOLEN: There is?
FLETCH: Whoa, look out there. You really need the whole fist?
DR. DOLEN: Just relax.
FLETCH: Gee, Alan's been looking kind of sick lately. Is he all right?
DR. DOLEN: I can't discuss another patient. You know that. Well, I can't find anything wrong with you.
FLETCH: I'm sure it's not for a lack of looking. Maybe I should get a real complete physical. You give Alan an annual, don't you?
DR. DOLEN: Yeah, we check you into Mt. Hebron for a few days, run lots of tests, charge a bundle. You can pull your pants up now.
FLETCH: I hope they still fit. Do I get to keep the glove?
DR. DOLEN: Tell the nurse when you've got a few free days. She'll make all the arrangements.
FLETCH: Thanks, Doc. Maybe I'll come back with a date. Or an elephant.
