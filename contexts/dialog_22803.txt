DANNY: I've got a hot one.
TANNER: You go, boy.
DANNY: If it's all the same to you, I'd rather not dish right here in the middle of Crankville.
TANNER: Feeling the paranoia tonight, are we?
DANNY: Well, you know what they say, just because you're paranoid, doesn't mean everyone's not out to slice your balls off and shove 'em down your throat.
TANNER: You got a name?
DANNY: Bobby, rhymes with hobby.
TANNER: What?
DANNY: Never mind. Dude had a backfull of jailhouse tatts.
TANNER: No last name?
DANNY: It was all pretty informal. Didn't have a lot of time to exchange pleasantries.
GARCETTI: This the guy?
DANNY: It speaks!
DANNY: That's him. He's a lot prettier in person though.
GARCETTI: Cut to the fucking chase, Flynne.
DANNY: Dude is bugging. Transparent spiders, plastic men - the whole nine yards.
GARCETTI: What's he holding?
