RIPLEY: Thanks so much for inviting me tonight.
JOAN: Can you bear it? We hear you're a friend of Freddie's -- he has I hate Opera tattooed on his chest.
RIPLEY: There's room for a whole libretto on Freddie's chest.
JOAN: I'm sure we've met.
JOAN: I was sure we'd met, weren't you, Ted? This is Herbert Greenleaf's boy.
RIPLEY: Thanks, yes, I think we did.
JOAN: One minute you people are children and the next you're getting tattooed.
MARGE: Oh my God. Tom.
RIPLEY: Marge, how are you? What are you doing in Rome?
MARGE: Is he here? Are you with Dickie?
RIPLEY: No. Hello, I'm Tom Ripley.
PETER: Peter Smith-Kingsley. I've heard about you, of course -- from Marge, and Dickie.
MARGE: No glasses.
RIPLEY: Ditto.
PETER: Where are you hiding him? He's impossible, isn't he?
MARGE: Is he really not here?
RIPLEY: Marge, you know Dickie has I hate Opera tattooed on his chest.
MARGE: You were going to Venice.
PETER: Yes, what happened? I heard you were desperate to come. I was looking forward to rowing you around.
RIPLEY: I am. I really am. And I've been travelling. I just can't seem to get that far north.
PETER: Well hurry, before we sink. Should I give you my telephone number in Venice?
RIPLEY: Thanks.
PETER: Look there's Meredith thingy -- who's that, Marge? -- They're in textiles... Meredith -- God, how awful, I've spent Christmas in her house...!
MARGE: I don't know her. He hasn't called, he's hardly written, just these cryptic notes. You don't just dump people.
PETER: Will we see you later?
RIPLEY: I can't later.
PETER: And tomorrow?
RIPLEY: Tomorrow's possible. Do you know Dinelli's? Piazza di Spagna?
PETER: I know the Piazza di Spagna. What time?
RIPLEY: Ten thirty?
PETER: We'll be there.
RIPLEY: Okay. Marge, see you tomorrow. It's really good to meet you.
RIPLEY: Let's go.
MEREDITH: I thought you were enjoying yourself?
RIPLEY: Let's take a Carozza and look at the moon.
MEREDITH: You're crazy! It's freezing out there.
RIPLEY: C'mon, I need to talk to you. Just the two of us.
MEREDITH: Okay then, you're crazy.
MEREDITH: Don't worry. Really. Don't worry.
RIPLEY: You're such a pal to understand. It's as if Marge is here now -- I look at you and I see her face -- and I can't, whatever I'm feeling towards you -- I just can't...
MEREDITH: No, I absolutely understand. Of course.
RIPLEY: Otherwise you'd be fighting me off.
MEREDITH: Beating you away.
MEREDITH: Will you meet me tomorrow? Just to say goodbye in the daylight, properly? So it's not just this, it's too... you should always save pain for daylight...
RIPLEY: Oh Meredith, I'm sorry. Of course I'll meet you. Let's have coffee in the morning at Dinelli's.
MEREDITH: I don't -- is that by the Spanish Steps?
RIPLEY: Exactly. 10.30 --
