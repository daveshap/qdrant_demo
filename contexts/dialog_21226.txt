JENNIFER: No way.
DAVID: One date, Jen--that's all I'm asking. If you don't go out with this guy we could throw their whole universe out of whack.
JENNIFER: It's too weird David. This place is giving me the creeps. Did you know all the books are blank?
DAVID: What?
JENNIFER: I looked in the library. They got covers with nothing inside them.
DAVID: What were you doing in a library?
JENNIFER: I got lost. Oh here ... look at this!
DAVID: JENNIFER!
JENNIFER: Just watch. You know why those guys just get cats out of trees? 'Cause nothing burns around here, that's why! They don't need any firemen ...
DAVID: Jen, listen ...
JENNIFER: I like--really need a cigarette, too.
DAVID: I'll get us out of here. I really will. But if we don't play along we could alter their whole existence. We may never get home.
