Did AG Jeff Sessions commit perjury during his confirmation hearing when he didn't disclose prior meetings with the Russian Ambassador?
Per [this report](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/sessions-spoke-twice-with-russian-ambassador-during-trumps-presidential-campaign-justice-officials-say/2017/03/01/77205eda-feac-11e6-99b4-9e613afeb09f_story.html?utm_term=.9f4d8f2f3967&wpisrc=al_alert-COMBO-politics%252Bnation#comments) from the Washington Post, Attorney General Jeff Sessions "spoke twice last year with Russia’s ambassador to the United States... encounters he did not disclose when asked about possible contacts between members of President Trump’s campaign and representatives of Moscow during Sessions’s confirmation hearing to become attorney general." 

When asked by Sen. Al Franken (D - MN) what he would do if it was revealed that anyone in the Trump campaign spoke with Russian officials, Sessions said "I’m not aware of any of those activities... I have been called a surrogate at a time or two in that campaign and I did not have communications with the Russians."

My question is, does this constitute perjury? And if not, does this make it anymore likely that a special prosecutor will be appointed to investigate the Russian ties with the Trump campaign?
