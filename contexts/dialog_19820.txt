CARLA JEAN: Why would we go to Odessa?
MOSS: Not we, you. Stay with your mother.
CARLA JEAN: Well -- how come?
CARLA JEAN: So... for how long do we have to...
MOSS: Baby, at what point would you quit botherin' to look for your two million dollars?
CARLA JEAN: What'm I supposed to tell Mama?
MOSS: Try standin' in the door and hollerin: Mama I'm home.
CARLA JEAN: Llewelyn --
MOSS: C'mon, pack your things. Anything you leave you ain't gonna see again.
CARLA JEAN: Well thanks for fallin' all over and apologizing.
MOSS: Things happened. I can't take 'em back.
