ANN: Come on!!
GRAHAM: All right!! All right!! You want to know? You want to know how I feel? I feel ashamed. Is that what you wanted to hear?
ANN: Why are you ashamed?
GRAHAM: Jesus Christ, Ann. Why is anybody anything? I think you have this idea that people are either all good or all bad, and you don't allow for any gray areas, and that's what most of us consist of.
ANN: You're not answering me.
GRAHAM: Well, what kind of answer are you looking for, Ann? What is it exactly that you want to know?
ANN: I want to know why you are the way you are!
GRAHAM: And I'm telling you it's not any one thing that I can point to and say That's why!" It doesn't work that way with people who have problems
ANN: But why can't you just put it all behind you? Can't you just forget it? All that stuff you did?
GRAHAM: No, Ann, I can't. I can't forget it. It's not something I can fix. It's difficult. There s something in my mind... the way my brain works... God, Ann, when you're with another person, and you're... inside them, you're so vulnerable, you're revealing so much... there's no protection. And... somebody could say, or do something to you while you're in this... state of... nakedness. And they could hurt you without even knowing it. In a way that you couldn't even see. And you would withdraw. To make sure it didn't happen again.
