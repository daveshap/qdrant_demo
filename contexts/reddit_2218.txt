Got accepted into two schools in one week! Very proud of myself.
They aren’t Ivies or “prestigious schools” but Southern Illinois University (my home academic establishment) and Washington State University both sent me acceptance letters this week and I’m very excited! I didn’t apply to any prestigious schools because I felt I wouldn’t fit in very well. I’m glad to be getting into schools that will fit my academic level and push me towards a better future.
