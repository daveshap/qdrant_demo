I am a high schooler and I need support and advice
(I am not used to Reddit and it's etiquette so forgive me for my mistakes.)

Hi, I am a male high schooler going through a rough time, and I would like. At school, I used to be much more extroverted but because of this classmate, let's just call him "E," I have become much more introverted. E kinda pushed me away from my friends because he insulted me for being myself and has called me hurtful names in the past (I understand that other people have been through much worse, but I would appreciate it if you would just give advice instead of a comparison). I asked E to stop it because it hurt my feelings and he has stopped, but he did it so much that I adapted to not do things that I feel like I need to watch everything I do so he wouldn't insult me again (he called me "retard" once for being clumsy) when I am at school and now I feel the need to do it when I am at home even though he is not here.

How do I move on and stop obsessing over what E thinks of me and forget that he was mean to me?

(I apologize if this was a weird read - I am not very articulate when I am sad, also, let me know if you would like more facts about the situation)

Please respond as soon as possible
