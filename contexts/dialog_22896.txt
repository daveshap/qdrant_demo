SARGE: What do you think?
MILLER: Well, if we had ten times the men and a lot more ammo, we might stand a chance, but not against those tanks.
SARGE: What are we going to do?
MILLER: We're going to hope like hell the tanks were on their way somewhere else.
REIBEN: Maybe Caen.
MILLER: Let's hope, because we're sure as hell not going to do any damage to them with what we have here.
UPHAM: What about our grenades?
MILLER: Those are Tigers, they have six-inch armor, they don't even notice grenades.
UPHAM: Would they notice and eighty-eight?
MILLER: Sure, you got one?
UPHAM: The Germans do.
