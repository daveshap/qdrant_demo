Please Read. I don't know what to do.
This is a throwaway account just to get it out of the way.

sorry if this is all over the place I genuinely apologize in advance

So currently I live in a condo with my mom and dad (im 15). And about to move to a ranch where they own 30 acres of land to "prepare" for a apocalypse or something like that (they're conspiracy theorists like heavy conspiracy theorists). and recently we took a 2 week road trip there so we know what to do when we fully get there. but thats the issue. We'll be in the middle of nowhere completely disconnected from society and I dont want to. and the main reason for that is because I haven't been in school for this entire school year. Im seriously worried about my education but both my parents think school is complete bullshit. and to an extent I agree, but its 10000x easier to get a job if you have a high school diploma rather than to not have passed the 8th grade. And at first I thought i'd just do online schooling and it'll be fine. but we dont have enough power in the house. We have 3 tiny solar panels that barely make it through the whole day. so trying to run a computer with it is next to impossible. I dont know what to do at this point. Its really stressing me out and i've tried talking to them about letting me live with a relative (who i've asked if anything happens i can stay with her and im very close with her), but nothing. It's almost like talking to a brick wall sometimes. Only thing i've thought of was to get cps involved but that could end them up in jail which I definitely don't want to happen. Please reply with any ideas you might have.
