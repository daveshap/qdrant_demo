Security for FTP connection within a server In PHP, I am accessing another user's files using FTP on the same server. In this case, do I need to use secure FTP or is it ok to have normal FTP as both source and destination are on the same server?Adding after getting some comments and answers:One website is accessing files of another website for some processing requirements and cloning. There is no permission issue. Both websites are under different users in linux so PHP code executing under 1 user cannot access files of another user for copying. Also, I am using FTP (which is already there on the server) because in future these websites may be on different servers. But now they are on same server.Notes: - Both website users cannot be added to same group as this is the only time one website accesses files of another site. After that they should not be able to access files of one another.
