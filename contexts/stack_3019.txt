Paradox of the magnetic field's collapse Imagine two strong electromagnets (X and Y) enough far from each other.Facts:<blockquote>  1.) We know the magnetic fields spreading with the speed of light.    2.) When the magnetic fields reach the other electromagnets they will move.</blockquote>What happens if you turn off X before its magnetic field reach Y? For example the magnetic field off X needs 1 second to reach Y and you turn of X after 0.9 second. <blockquote>  1.) Both X and Y will not move. In this case the information about the collapse of the magnetic field is faster than the light. (0.1 s was  enough to reach Y from X!)    2.) X will move but Y will not. In this case you can build a magnetic rocket engine wich doesn't need any propellant just energy.    3.) Y will move but X will not. The same than the previous.    4.) Both X and Y will move. How can X move if there is no magnetic field around it? In this case you can get information about Y on an  extremely safety way. A third person cannot detect the informations  from Y.</blockquote>
