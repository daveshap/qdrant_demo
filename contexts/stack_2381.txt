How do I get the shop to refresh, and how often does it refresh? How do I get the shop to refresh?  And how often does it refresh?  Currently I have 7 out of 10 slots open with purchasable items, 3 of the slots are locked and don't have any merchandise.  I bought out everything but the first 3 items, and got a message saying I needed to spend 1200gp? to refresh the shop, but I've done that and still can't figure out how to get the shop to refresh.  Is it a timer based thing? Or is there some other, more consistent and quicker way to get the shop to refresh. I'd like to buy up as much Mii headgear as possible.
