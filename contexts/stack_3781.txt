How to determine the best forecasting model for this type of data? I am working on teaching myself some forecasting techniques that I can use in the future.Imagine a shopping mall. The mall contains many shops which each sell different products. I have a bunch of data relating to each shop:<blockquote>  Number of products they sell    Price of these products    Historical sales figures    The type of shop    How many customers visit each shop in a given window    How many days a week the shop is open for    ...    etc</blockquote>I am looking for a way to predict based on the above how much revenue a given shop is likely to take in a month?E.g. A computer shop with 500 products that is open everyday and took 5000, 3700, 4900,...,6000 is estimated to bring in 5400USD next month.I have had some limited success in the past using time series methods but I feel like there is not really any seasonal growth for a large number of shops and I am wondering about other methods.Also I know that all of the data I have may not be relevant (for instance the number of products they sell may not make any difference to the predicted values of sales going forward) but I have a lot of data so want to incorporate some of it into the model rather than just a straight time series.Can anyone suggest any types of models that might be appropriate?I have heard about logistic regression and linear regression and have vaguely looked at the former and seem a bit of the latter are these useful?If not could someone tell me what kind of models I could be researching into in order to build a model that utilises the data as I don't think I am making the most of the large amounts of data I have.Thanks!
