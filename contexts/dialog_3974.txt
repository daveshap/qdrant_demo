TROY: Millions upon millions upon millions! The cards. The stock! The clothes! The toothpaste! The guy was on the level! And you blew it! A man walks into your life who is the kindest, most polite, honest, trustworthy, incredibly rich guy you have ever met in your life!! And what do you do?!
EVE: Have him committed.
TROY: Yeah! That's thinking.
EVE: He was always so nice"! How was I supposed to know that's a good thing?! "Nice" is weird! Nice is...what is "nice"? It's not cool! I'll tell you that. Was it ever?"
TROY: I don't know. I like to think so.
EVE: Well, at least I fell for him before I found out he was rich! That's new. Wait a minute! He said today he knew where home was. What happened this morning?! Where did you go?!
TROY: To get some frozen poultry.
EVE: Then what?
TROY: We came back to the house!
EVE: You didn't stop anywhere else?!
TROY: No. No, wait a minute. We stopped at a porno store.
EVE: What?!
TROY: An adult bookstore. He was very excited about seeing it. You think home is under a dirty bookstore in the Valley?
EVE: Come on.
