how do you identify a bad boss in an interview?
I know there are some obvious red flags like overtly being rude or being arrogant. Are any good questions to ask to reveal a bad boss that might not be as obvious ?

Everyone I have ever spoken to has only had good things to say about my boss. Including people that do not work at the company now but worked for him before. But after working for him a while, I finally know his real nature. He is a really nice guy and very personable, but he looks out only for himself. He is quick to place blame on others, especially those he manages, and does not share proper credit with his team when things go well. He does not stick up for his team and does not share opportunities for growth- instead he keeps those opportunities for himself and keeps them secret. He does not adequately thank his team for their hard work and basically wants to make sure that he is seen as the "rockstar" of the group while the rest of us are his little minions.

Are there any questions I could have asked during the interview process or anything else I could have done to get hints at these traits beforehand? 

How can you tell when a boss is BSing you in an interview versus is a genuinely good boss?
