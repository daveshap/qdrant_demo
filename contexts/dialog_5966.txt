ROSE ROSE: We should drown that damn Jack in the vat!
MR. ROSE: Now, now, darlin'... Jack just needs to know what business he's in.
ROSE ROSE: Yeah, you really showed him, Daddy-- you just about cut your own hand off, and all you cut off *him* was his clothes!
MR. ROSE: You oughta know you don't go to jail for cuttin' a guy's *clothes*. Ain't that right, Homer?
CANDY: You're a natural. You were born to drive a car like this.
HOMER: You think? Maybe I was. I love this place!
HOMER: The screen is enormous! Imagine King Kong up *there*! Have you seen a lot of movies here?
CANDY: Yes... and no. When you come here, you don't really care about the movie.
