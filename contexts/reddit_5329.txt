Would it be workplace discrimination if a man gets reprimanded for having nail polish while a female co-worker is allowed to have nail polish?
This is under the assumption that there is no written/verbal agreement that a male employee is not allowed to have nail polish.

I live in a liberal state (NY) and I am just wondering about this scenario.
