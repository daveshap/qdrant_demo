ART: Alright we're clear.
LOU: Anything new?
ART: Not really. One girl who fit the descrip came in, kinda skinny, brunette, didn't see much changing hands.
LOU: Is the manager cooperating?
ART: Yeah, he's keeping an eye out, said he'd call us if he sees anything. That's about it for tonight.
LOU: Alright I got you, man. It's my turn for freak patrol.
ART: You know it. I'm out of here.
