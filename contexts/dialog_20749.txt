KENTON: It's good to be King, hey Charles?
WHEELER: Kings are out of fashion. I'd rather be thought of as a benevolent tyrant. It's an anti-trust action.
ANDREW: It is, and it isn't, Charles. Macrosystem's new software copies all the best-known elements of Kronos' spreadsheet program. If they're allowed to sell it, Kronos will get undersold right out of business. For me, the legal principle, involved is copyright infringement.
WHEELER: Bearing in mind that Bill Wright, the chairman of MacroSystems, is a close, personal friend of mine... which side of this mess would <u>you</u> desire to be on, Andy? And don't allow my very tight, personal relationship with Bill to influence your answer in any way.
