What are the ethics, law, and precedent around unmasking anonymous people who allegedly oppose the US President?
Currently there are several controversies about anonymous people who have, in various ways, been construed as opponents of the US President:

# The Ukraine whistleblower

The ongoing [Trump–Ukraine scandal and impeachment inquiry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump–Ukraine_scandal) first came to light when an unnamed CIA officer [filed a whistleblower complaint with the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-whistleblower-idUSKBN1WB0E5). Although the complaint was secondhand information and has now been [corroborated by more direct evidence](https://www.npr.org/2019/11/09/776173492/the-whistleblower-complaint-has-largely-been-corroborated-heres-how), the President has [called](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/10/21/impeachment-trump-says-ukraine-whistleblower-should-identified/4053046002/) for public identification of the whistleblower and assessment of his credibility. For example, the president's son [tweeted](https://www.msn.com/en-xl/northamerica/top-stories/impeachment-trumps-son-tweets-name-of-alleged-whistleblower/ar-AAJX7Ee) a Breitbart article containing the name of someone suspected of being the whistleblower, and a false misidentification of the whistleblower [circulated on social media](https://www.thedailybeast.com/trumpkins-thought-this-man-was-the-whistleblower-they-were-wrong) although that person did not work in the government at the time. Republican members of the House of Representatives [reportedly](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/in-impeachment-inquiry-republican-lawmakers-ask-questions-about-whistleblower-loyalty-to-trump-and-conspiracy-theories/2019/10/26/bf733450-f760-11e9-a285-882a8e386a96_story.html) used their questioning in recent closed-door hearings to identify the whistleblower. Senator Rand Paul, a libertarian-aligned Republican, [called on the media](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2019/11/04/rand-paul-demands-media-reveal-whistleblowers-name-do-your-job/4162211002/) to publish the alleged identity of the whistleblower.

# The anonymous op-ed and book author

Last year a "senior administration official" [published](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/05/opinion/trump-white-house-anonymous-resistance.html) an op-ed in the New York Times calling out mismanagement and dysfunction in the Trump administration, and is back in the news with [an excerpt](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/book-by-anonymous-describes-trump-as-cruel-inept-and-a-danger-to-the-nation/2019/11/07/b6b6c6f2-0150-11ea-8bab-0fc209e065a8_story.html) from a forthcoming book. The President [demanded](https://www.cnn.com/2018/09/05/politics/nyt-trump-resistance-op-ed/index.html) that the Times "must, for National Security purposes, turn him/her over to government at once!", calling the op-ed ["TREASON?"](https://twitter.com/realDonaldTrump/status/1037464177269514240). Sen. Rand Paul [proposed](https://www.newsweek.com/rand-paul-trump-lie-detector-tests-trump-1110033) that the White House should use polygraph tests to ferret out the author.

# The alleged Roger Stone juror

The President's sometime adviser Roger Stone is [currently on trial](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/comedian-takes-stage-trial-trump-adviser-roger-stone/story?id=66854483) for alleged lying to Congress and witness tampering in Robert Mueller's investigation of his alleged role as the intermediary between the Trump 2016 campaign and Wikileaks regarding the release of DNC emails hacked by the Russian government. His fellow InfoWars host Alex Jones [broadcasted](https://www.thedailybeast.com/alex-jones-goes-on-tirade-against-roger-stone-jurors) the name and face of a woman he claimed was a juror in the trial and also a former employee of the Obama administration, although he reportedly misidentified the woman and she was not empaneled on the final jury anyway.

All three of these people remain anonymous in the mainstream media and might be subject to political retaliation if exposed. However, they have all been accused of prejudice against the President and using their anonymity as a shield to cover their unfair attacks against him.

To what extent is their anonymity protected by ethical standards, legal statute, and prior precedent? In particular, what consequences can people in different positions face for exposing their identities and how are those consequences enforced? Do journalists, members of Congress, or the President have ways of broadcasting these identities with special immunity from the consequences that would normally fall upon private citizens?
