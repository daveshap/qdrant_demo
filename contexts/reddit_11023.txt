My dad ate breakfast at around 11:45, and when he finished, it was around 12:10. You know what he did next?
He said "Oh, it's lunchtime." And just made himself a second bowl of cereal right after the other


Edit: For those of you saying that 25 minutes to eat cereal is a long time and it will go soggy, he reads the newspaper while eating so it takes a long time.
