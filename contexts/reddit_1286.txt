Does anyone else get upset and hurt when your posts or comments get downvoted?
I just joined reddit the other day and I’m feeling like it’s really not good for my mental health. Whenever something gets downvoted I feel like people are thinking bad things about me or I said something wrong and I feel stupid. It’s like high school social anxiety all over again
