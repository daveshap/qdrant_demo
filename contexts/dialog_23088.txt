SIDNEY: Who did you call?
BILLY: What?
SIDNEY: When you're arrested -- you're allowed one phone call? Who did you call?
BILLY: I called my dad.
SIDNEY: No, Sheriff Burke called your dad. I saw him.
BILLY: Yeah... and when I called no one answered.
SIDNEY: Uh-huh.
BILLY: You don't still think it was me?
SIDNEY: No, but if it were you, that would have been a very clever way to throw me off track. Using your one phone call to call me so I wouldn't think it was you.
