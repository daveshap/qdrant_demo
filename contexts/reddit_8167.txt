What have we learned from the plea agreement regarding former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn?
This morning Michael Flynn [plead guilty](https://www.justice.gov/file/1015126/download) to one count of lying to the FBI under 18 USC 1001.  

As part of the plea agreement, Flynn [has agreed to cooperate](https://www.justice.gov/file/1015121/download) with prosecutors in the Special Counsel's office.

[A report from ABC News](http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/michael-flynn-charged-making-false-statements-fbi-documents/story?id=50849354) indicates that Flynn "is prepared to testify that Donald Trump directed him to make contact with the Russians, initially as a way to work together to fight ISIS in Syria."

A few questions:

* How does this new information update our knowledge of the state of the allegations of collusion with the Russian government?

*   Does it contradict or prove false any prior statements from key players?  

* Are any crimes (by Flynn or others) other than those Flynn plead to today proven or more easily proved?
