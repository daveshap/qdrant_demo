JAKE: Who the hell is this!?
BOBBY: Who the hell are you?
JAKE: I'm her husband.
JAKE: Now who the hell are you, and it better be good, or God help me I'll break you in half.
BOBBY: Easy, chief. I... I was helping your wife. I met her in town. She needed a hand with her drapes. That's all.
JAKE: Didn't much look like you were hanging drapes.
BOBBY: I swear to you that's all that happened. I haven't so much as set foot in your bedroom.
JAKE: A lot that means.
BOBBY: Grace, tell him.
