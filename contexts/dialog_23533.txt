DAVID: All right, just a few questions.
ALEX: I'd like to ask you about your hobbies.
JULIET: Why do you want a room here?
DAVID: Do you smoke?
ALEX: When you slaughter a goat and wrench its heart out with your bare hands, do you then summon hellfire?
JULIET: I mean, what are you actually doing here? What is the hidden agenda?
DAVID: Do a little freebasemaybe, from time to time?
ALEX: Or maybe just phone out for a pizza?
JULIET: Look, it's a fairly straightforward question. You're either divorced or you're not.
DAVID: OK, I'm going to play you just a few seconds of this tape -- I'd like you to name the song, the lead singer and the three hit singles subsequently recorded by him with another band.
ALEX: When you get up in the morning, how do you decide what shade of black to wear?
JULIET: Now, let me get this straight. This affair that you're not having, is it not with a man or not with a woman?
DAVID: Turning very briefly to the subject of corporate finance -- no, this is important. Leveraged buy-outs -- a good thing or a bad thing?
ALEX: With which of the following figures do you most closely identify: Joan of Arc, Eva Braun or Marilyn Monroe?
JULIET: It's just that you strike me as a man trapped in a crisis of emotional direction, afflicted by a realization that the partner of your dreams is, quite simply, just that.
DAVID: Did you ever kill a man?
ALEX: And when did anyone last say to you these exact words: You are the sunshine of my life'?
JULIET: OK, so A has left you, B is ambivalent, you're still seeing C but D is the one you yearn for. What are we to make of this? If I were you, I'd ditch the lot. There's a lot more letters in the alphabet of love.
