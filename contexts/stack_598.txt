mount windos partitions with same parameters as Files ( file browser ) ubuntu 16.04 I want to run for, some data analisys, my computer in headless mode. It is a dual boot windows /ubuntu 16.04 system.I regularly just click on the file browser, on the offered local partitions to automatically mount local partitions I am interested in each moment. No questions ask, it just works.This is the fstab line/dev/mapper/isw_cjbadfefde_ASUS_OS5 on /media/julian/New_Volume type fuseblk (rw,nosuid,nodev,relatime,user_id=0,group_id=0,default_permissions,allow_other,blksize=4096,uhelper=udisks2)However, I am finding imposible to manually replicate such mount when running headless ( no access to file browser )Can somebody give me a hint on how to make the very same mount, manually ?Thanks.JC
