ETHAN: Talk!
FUTTERMAN: A young buck fetched it in late last summer... Said it belonged to a captive chile of Chief Scar...
ETHAN: Scar? Never heard of any Chief Scar.
FUTTERMAN: Me neither...But this buck claimed he was a big war chief with the Nawyecky Comanches.
ETHAN: Keep talking.
FUTTERMAN: Scar's band was headin' north...to winter in at Fort Wingate...eatin' agency beef. That's what this buck said...Maybe he lied.
ETHAN: And maybe you lie...
FUTTERMAN: In that case you won't find her -- and I won't get my thousand dollars.
