Ubuntu installation interface not responding I just bought a new HP Pavilion 15 with Windows 10 Home already installed. I wanted to install a dual boot with the latest Ubuntu OS (Bionic Beaver 18.04 LTS). I disable the Secure Boot and the Fast Boot options. I put Ubuntu on my USB key with Rufus (FAT32, on GPT/UEFI partition) and ran my laptop from it. Ubuntu runs, and then, after more or less 15 seconds, I can't click on anything. I still can see my mouse move but the UI is not responding... I already tried several times but it is always the same problem.Does anyone have ever run into this issue ?
