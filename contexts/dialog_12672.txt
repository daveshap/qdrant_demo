BEDSOE: What the hell. What is this? A joke?
ROBBERY DETECTIVE: No joke, Lieutenant.
BEDSOE: Where's the guy we saw in the beginning -- what's his name...?
ROBBERY DETECTIVE: Parker. We found him knocked out in the can.
BEDSOE: If he was knocked out in the can how could be walking across the lobby?
ROBBERY DETECTIVE: Hey, I don't have answers for this. I just brought you down here because of the sword.
BEDSOE: Am I supposed to believe that this guy got shot in the chest six times at point blank range and just got up and walked out?
ROBBERY DETECTIVE: You can believe what you want. You saw the tape.
BEDSOE: You didn't see this. Understand?
JENNIFER: Yes.
