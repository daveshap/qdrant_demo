Is it okay to have different versions of your CV that highlight different work experience?
I have 13 years of nonprofit experience, mostly in comms/project management, with a lot of adjunct experience in partnerships and digital marketing/social media. I'm applying to a social impact organization that has a few positions open. The one I'd really like to interview for is a strategic partnerships role (a bit of a reach as this hasn't been my direct focus, but I certainly have enough experience to make a case for applying), but there is also a social media manager position I am qualified for. Since I am sort of an outreach/marketing/comms generalist, I can tweak my CV to go a bunch of different directions depending on what I want to highlight (can't say it all!).

I have a contact in the org I'd like to shoot an email to and tell about my interest in these two roles. Is it okay to provide two versions of my CV for the two different positions or is that looked down upon?
