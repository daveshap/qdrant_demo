Just landed a great sales job in NYC. Here's what I did to have a successful job hunt!
I'd been trying to move back to NYC after having done an internship here a few years ago. Unfortunately, I couldn't get so much as a call because I was living in Ohio. Well, I sold my car, packed two suitcases and got a sublet for a couple months and, about 3 weeks later, I was employed! I'm working for a great company that should yield some fantastic income and it's something I never even knew I'd be interested in.

Enough about me. Here's what I did over the past few weeks to land a job:

RESUME:
•Personalize each resume you send with company name and position. I kept a general resume and would just change out the company name, position and any skills they mention in the description. Save each one as a PDF with your name, desired position and company and throw it in a folder on your desktop. It takes seconds but why not make sure it's not just a vague, half-assed resume?

•Make sure that there are NO spelling or grammatical errors on your resume. None. Take it to your friend with the English degree. Take it to your university's writing center. I work with several recruiters now who said they can spot a typo within 3 seconds-- and guess what happens to that resume?

•Create a section that lists skills and abilities. Why? Resume searching software pulls keywords!

•Your friend, the graphic designer? Throw him $20 and a case of beer and have them create a great layout, something you can edit. Do you know how many boring, ugly resumes come through?

•If your GPA is above a 3.0, throw it on the resume. Also, add what year and month you graduated. A recruiter mentioned that they like to see it-- and if they don't see it they sometimes view it as a red flag that you didn't graduate or are hiding something.

THE COVER LETTER

•I hated writing these. But write a few drafts. Trim them, omit things and get them down to a reasonable length. Try to throw in the keywords that you see mentioned in the description so anyone scanning your cover letter will pick them up. Keep it concise.

•I had several versions of these because I was considering different roles. I had one for sales, one for corporate advertising/marketing, one for advertising agency and one general one for anything that didn't quite fit the others. If you're applying to very different roles, just have different cover letters, drop in the company name and position and BOOM-- personalized cover letter.

•At the end, don't simply just say "Let me know if you want to talk". Offer a time or date when you can come in. Tell them that you'll call them this week to ensure they received the cover letter-- and then CALL THEM FOR REAL. Ask for an interview, even if it's just a phone or Skype interview. Why offer all of this info to them with no call to action?

THE HUNT

•Update your LinkedIn profile. This is now maybe just as important as showing up to an interview because it's what recruiters look at all day long (Source: I work with a team of recruiters and interviewed with another recruiting agency) Recommend people you believe in and write them reviews. Request or hope that they do the same. Join professional groups that have to do with your industry, geographic area or education. Make sure that your LinkedIn profile has your most recent resume and credentials listed! And that photo? Better be professional looking.

•I set aside times of the day to hunt. I started beating myself up after a while when I didn't get up at 7AM and work until 7PM. But what I found is that the timeframe of 1PM-8PM was my sweet spot, so that's what I did. It IS important to keep business hours though so that you can go into an interview at a moment's notice!

•Check out LinkedIn, Indeed, Craigslist and any industry-related search sites. I found Monster and Careerbuilder to be useless.

•See a job you want? Throw down a few bucks and Fed Ex your resume, cover letter and portfolio to the hiring manager. Makes a bigger impression than just another PDF file they delete from their inbox.

•Reach out to hiring managers and HR people on LinkedIn. Ask for interviews!

•Find the name and number of the person doing the hiring? Call them. Ask for interviews! (Seeing a pattern?)

•This is perhaps one of the most valuable tips: try to find a good staffing agency or recruiter that specializes in your field. Why? They're paid to place people, unlike that HR lady you keep bombarding with your resume. Do your homework, but this was incredibly important in me getting interviews, freelance work and, eventually, my job.

THE INTERVIEW:
•For the love of God, don't be late.

•You're not late? Good. What are you wearing? It should match the company culture to the best of your knowledge. Applying to an account firm? Suit up. Applying to be a graphic designer at a boutique agency? Slim chinos and a button down. When in doubt, dress up. 

•On appearance: be clean, well-groomed. Your clothes don't need to be Versace and Armani, but try to look current and put together. If you need to, go drop $50 at H&M and get something a little snazzier than the pleated pants and too-big shirt you bought at Kohls six years ago.

•Also on appearance: nonverbal communication is important. Sit upright, don't slouch. Give a firm handshake, not a dead fish. Make eye contact. Smile. Smile. Smile. (Not too much, you don't want them to think you're too weird!)

•Prepare for the interview. Before you go in, research what the company does. Bring up any (positive) headlines you've seen in the news about them. 

•When they say "Do you have any questions?"-- ASK QUESTIONS! "What's your favorite part about working here?" "What kind of additional projects could I take on?" "What does the perfect candidate look like?" Whatever their answers are, relate it to you and your experience. If they say they want a proactive accountant, mention how you took it upon yourself to find some billing issue at your last job. Whatever it is, relate their answer to you. Make it so YOU are the solution.

•Create a 30/60/90 Day Plan and present it to the interviewer after you've interviewed once or twice and base it on the info you gather from the interview. Basically, you just write out what you plan to do in the first 30, 60 and 90 days if you're hired. Do you know how impressed the people interviewing me were when I did this? This alone might've gotten me the job.

•If you feel comfortable that you're probably being considered for the job, ask for it! You don't have to say "Give me the job", but approach it as "I'm really excited about this position. If you could present me with an offer, I'd be thrilled to join your team!"

•I've gotten mixed reactions on this one when I mention it to others, but it's ALWAYS worked for me. At the very end of the interview, I say something to the effect of "You know, I'm great with criticism. Is there anything about me, the interview or my experience that you have any concern over?" Don't pry, but let them think for a moment. Maybe they'll come back and say "You're a bit junior for this position and I don't know if you have the experience in CSS or Java that we need..." Counter that. "I understand your concern, but I would point out that I am currently learning CSS and Java and that I learned HTML in three days. I may not be a senior programmer, but I learn these languages quickly." Boom. I don't like to let them walk out with a doubt in their mind about me and it's possibly the last time you'll get to fight for the position before they pass you over!

•Ask for their card. If they don't give you one, ask for the person's e-mail address at reception. Or just address a thank you card with the person's name and company as soon as you leave. Mail it immediately. Come home and write that e-mail (if you didn't send it snail mail) right away. I've been told by recruiters that this separates the "Maybes" from the "Likely New Employees".

•Consider not taking the job. I know, it's crazy-- but I turned down two really decent offers because I wasn't excited about them. Yes, I moved to NYC without a job and then turned down jobs. Crazy? Maybe. But look-- you'll be spending 40+ hours a week at this place. You are interviewing THEM in a sense, too. If you're not into it, write an e-mail after thinking on it and just say that you value their time and feel that you should no longer be considered a candidate. 

•Go on EVERY interview you're offered. You're overqualified? Go. You're underqualified? Go. You're not interested really? Go. It might seem like you're wasting the other person's time-- and perhaps you are. But it's GREAT for experience. Try out your new questions you've developed. Ask for feedback. Worst case scenario is that you walk away with a new contact, more interview experience and no anxiety next time. I walked into my current position's interview with no expectations and was thrilled when I received the offer. You never know!

ENCOURAGEMENT:
•I had a rule when I was job hunting. If I got a rejection letter or was denied a role, I did 3 positive things like apply to another job, contact a hiring manager or follow up on an application. It keeps you moving forward.

•Eat healthy. Go to the gym. Look and feel your best when you go in for the interview!


I realize this is a wall of text, but let me just put this out here: I have a liberal arts degree from a state college with a decent but not exemplary GPA. I moved to a new city without a job and took a huge risk. But what made me successful, I believe, is that I learned HOW to job hunt and gained some great skills and insight on how to do it. I made it my job to learn how and constantly improve. 

PM me if you have any questions and I'd be happy to answer them!
