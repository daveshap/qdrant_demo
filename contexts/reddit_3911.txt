Dating apps are based only on appearance
So I installed few apps recently to check them out (Tinder, Bumble, Badoo) and what really shocked me is that nearly noone has any bio written about themselves. What is the point of that? For me it looks like they want to be swiped right based only on appearance. There is also a lot of profiles with one sentence (punch?)line which also doesn't tell anything about that person. And everyone has a fountain of photos. I really don't understand that.
