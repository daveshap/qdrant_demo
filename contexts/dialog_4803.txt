FRANK: You wanted it turned off. There's no such thing as a good fire. People get burned up. They can't breathe.
LARRY: That's what we're here for. Come on, Frank.
FRANK: Don't push it, Larry.
LARRY: You're burned out.
RADIO DISPATCHER: One-three Zebra. Zebra three, I need you.
LARRY: You see, he's giving it to us anyway.
RADIO DISPATCHER: Zebra, are you there? I'm holding an unconscious at First and St. Marks.
LARRY: No! It's three o'clock. That can only mean one thing.
FRANK: Mr. Oh.
LARRY: It's Mr. Oh. I'm not answering it.
RADIO DISPATCHER: Answer the radio Zebra. You know it's that time.
LARRY: Four times this week I've had him. Aren't there any other units out there? Don't answer the radio. They'll give it to someone else.
RADIO DISPATCHER: Thirteen Zebra. One-Three Zebra. You're going out of service in two seconds.
LARRY: Look, Frank, when I say don't answer it, that means answer it. You can do that for me at least. Three Zebra.
RADIO DISPATCHER: Yes, Zebra. You'll be driving to the man who needs no introduction, chronic caller of the year three straight and shooting for number four. The duke of drunk, the king of stink, our most frequent flier, Mr. Oh.
LARRY: Ten-four. Don't go. Not this time.
FRANK: Relax, it's a street job, easy except for the smell. We'll just throw him in back and zip over to Mercy--no blood, no dying, that's how I look at it. He's just a drunk.
LARRY: It's not our job to taxi drunks around.
FRANK: They'll just keep calling.
LARRY: Someone's gonna die someday causa that bum, going to have a cardiac and the only medics will be taking care of Mr. Oh.
