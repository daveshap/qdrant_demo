WW: It's only a b-b-b-book...
LITTLE BILL: A book, huh? I guess that means you can read... An' I guess you boys seen them signs about surrendering your firearms... But then, like you told old Andy there, you ain't armed, are you, Bob?
ENGLISH BOB: Not really... Maybe a couple of Peacemakers... I imagine you could overlook those, eh, Bill? If you didn't see them... or hear them?
LITTLE BILL: I guess not, Bob. I don't like guns around.
LITTLE BILL: Charley, see what kind of books" Mister Beauchamp is packing... but watch you don't get wet."
ENGLISH BOB: Be careful with those, sonny.
