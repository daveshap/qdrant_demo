when do sat adversity scores come out?
i prepped a lot for this! i got ~10% of my school hooked on drugs and then reported them so the crime rate would increase. i also got a lot of my friend’s parents to get divorced so the single parent numbers would increase. i also did extensive work decreasing the value of people’s homes by having highway construction projects funded, fracking projects started, and having 200 registered sex offenders move into my neighborhood (thank you craigslist!). ~200 homes went down an average of $20k. is this enough prep to give me a good diversity score? will i have a shot at HYPSM??
