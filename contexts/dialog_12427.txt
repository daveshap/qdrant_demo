PRUDHOE: Well, isn't it?
JULIA: I... suppose so, yes.
PRUDHOE: So, what's your problem? Let's get to it. You're not going to change your fucking mind ?
JULIA: No. No. Let's go upstairs.
PRUDHOE: That's more like it.
PRUDHOE: Is this your place ?
JULIA: Do you care ?
PRUDHOE: No, not much.
JULIA: Let's keep it that way, shall we?
PRUDHOE: No personal details?
JULIA: That's right.
PRUDHOE: This isn't the bedroom.
JULIA: No.
PRUDHOE: What's going on?
JULIA: We don't need a bed, do we?
PRUDHOE: I suppose not.
JULIA: I prefer the floor.
PRUDHOE: First time for everything.
JULIA: That's right.
JULIA: Why don't you take off your jacket? You're warm.
PRUDHOE: Yeah, why don't I?
PRUDHOE: Why don't you do the same?
JULIA: Maybe I will.
PRUDHOE: You know, you're very beautiful.
JULIA: Am I?
PRUDHOE: You know you are. Loveliest woman I ever set eyes on.
PRUDHOE: Oh Christ.
JULIA: What's wrong?
PRUDHOE: Too much drink. Better empty my bladder.
