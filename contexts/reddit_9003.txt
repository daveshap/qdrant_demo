Why did Hollande's approval ratings drop to single digits following attacks in France, but Merkel's is about split despite attacks in Germany?

>Senior members of Angela Merkel’s party defended her refugee policy after the German chancellor’s approval rating plunged in the wake of a series of attacks that unsettled the public and sparked political opposition.

> Voter support for Merkel slumped 12 percentage points to 47 percent in July, the second-lowest of her third term that started in 2013, according to an Infratest dimap poll this week for ARD public television.

Before the recent attacks she was at 57% as well: http://www.wsj.com/articles/angela-merkel-faces-stiffer-challenge-after-berlin-attack-1482256039

>Hours after Ms. Merkel spoke, police released the detained suspect—a Pakistani man who entered Germany as a refugee last New Year’s Eve—because of a lack of evidence. But the rapidity with which the debate moved to Ms. Merkel’s refugee policy following the attack showed how vulnerable she is—despite her 57% approval rating—nine months before she stands for re-election.

Hollande, on the other hand, [dropped all the way to 4%](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2016/12/01/the-reason-french-president-hollande-wont-seek-reelection-in-one-chart/) and won't even seek reelection. I don't know much about either of them, but why didn't Germany react as strongly as France?
