EDDISON: And this Butterfield guy--
HARRY: --vanished.
EDDISON: Another fucking magician. Jesus.
HARRY: Are you finished with me?
EDDISON: For now. Are you planning to go back to New York?
HARRY: No. Not yet...
HARRY: Are they treating you okay?
DOROTHEA: I heard what happened. It looks like somebody murdered him.
HARRY: I'm sorry I got into this too late. But if you want me to stick around, maybe dig where the cops don't look...
DOROTHEA: I don't know where you'd start.
HARRY: Well... how about some of the other illusionists?
DOROTHEA: They won't tell you anything.
HARRY: I can be very persuasive.
DOROTHEA: Yes. I think you probably can. We'd need to talk about your fee.
HARRY: Forget the fee. If I find Butterfield, maybe we'll talk about money. If I don't... ...my gamble. Either way... I get to spend some time... here.
HARRY: Where'd you learn that?
WILDER: What?
HARRY: That.
WILDER: At birth. I don't know you --
HARRY: Harry D'Amour.
WILDER: I know all the kids coming up. Got to stay ahead of the game. But I don't know you.
HARRY: I'm in from New York. I came to see Swann.
WILDER: What a tragedy. It was just a matter of time, of course, but it's not good for the business.
HARRY: Was he taking a lot of risks?
WILDER: You don't know the half of it. I'm Walter Wilder, by the way.
HARRY: Not the Walter Wilder?
