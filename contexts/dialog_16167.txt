BOB: Mr. Stevens. One of your neighbors is adamant your home has exceeded its approved height. He's filed to have construction stopped immediately.
GEORGE: It's thirty feet.
BOB: Well, if it is, we have a problem.
GEORGE: I have the permit.
BOB: After your last extension request and with Design Review and the Board of Adjustment and the appeals to the city council, was there an amended permit?
GEORGE: To the patio and one north-facing window... And six inches to the height.
