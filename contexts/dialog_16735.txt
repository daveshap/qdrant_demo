DOORMAN: Sorry, man, but...
BOBBY: Thanks a lot. Don't worry about it.
DOORMAN: Any time, bro.
BOBBY: Thanks.
RUIZ: That's him. Now you all know the drill, right?
BOBBY: What drill?
RICKY: We don't know any drill. Nobody told us anything.
RUIZ: Maxie told you to keep your mouth shut while you're working, right?
BOBBY: Yeah.
RICKY: So we're working?
RUIZ: What the fuck you think, I wanna 'hang' with you motherfuckers? Yeah you're working. And put down the champagne.
RICKY: She poured it for --
RUIZ: Far as she knows you're John Gotti. Now put the shit down and act like you got some ass.
BOBBY: He making the drop?
HORRACE: Nah, man. He's just making contact. That's our man. The Welsh guy.
BOBBY: What's his name?
HORRACE: Ruiz don't like using names on cell phones. He refers to him as the Red Dragon.
BOBBY: So, when's the drop.
HORRACE: To be honest, man, I don't know shit either. All I know is it ain't drugs and it ain't now.
RICKY: How do you know it's not drugs?
HORRACE: Maxie knows I don't go near drugs. I did a minute in Quentin for possession with intent. And it ain't now cause he woulda told me.
RICKY: You strapped?
HORRACE: 'Strapped?'
RICKY: It means you got a gun?
HORRACE: I know what 'strapped' means, motherfucker. What the fuck you think this shit is? '21 Jump Street?' Cool out, they're coming back. Just throw up your screw face and don't speak unless spoken to.
