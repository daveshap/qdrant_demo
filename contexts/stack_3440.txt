Sharing a message broker between remote systems We are currently exploring solutions to push/synchronize data between two systems (in two separate networks) in \"near\" realtime.The solutions are somewhat limited :Some kind of RPC mechanism : HTTP \"Web Hooks\gRPC, SOAP, whatever...Sharing some kind of message-broker/queue (Apache Kafka, RabbitMQ, NATS...)From what I see, most message brokers are like databases : they implement a minimal level of security (credentials and sometimes TLS), but they rely mostly on network security. Question : is there a secure way to share a message-broker between two remote systems ?  All I could think of was either putting an application in front (hence falling back to solution 1.), or using a VPN.
