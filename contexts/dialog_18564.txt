DISRAELI: You will not be unaware of the threat now posed by Republicanism.
BROWN: Why do you think I keep her here?
DISRAELI: Ah, but therein lies the paradox. It is her very isolation that encourages the malcontents. The longer she is away, the stronger they become; and who, honestly, can promise security against that? However many doors you lock, someone will always get in. Even here.
BROWN: So...?
DISRAELI: The truth is, the Queen would be safer doing her duty and returning south to her public. John Bull loves her and John Bull is her best defense.
BROWN: Her mind is set. She won't change now.
DISRAELI: She trusts you, John.
BROWN: They don't see it.
DISRAELI: See what?
BROWN: The threat. I tell them, but they don't see it.
DISRAELI: They aren't as watchful as you.
BROWN: Too busy looking after themselves.
DISRAELI: The greasy pole.
BROWN: No loyalty.
DISRAELI: No love.
BROWN: I promised to protect her from people like you.
DISRAELI: For once in my life, I am not the issue.
BROWN: She'll never understand it.
DISRAELI: In time, she will.
BROWN: She'll think I betrayed her.
DISRAELI: But others will know that you acted for the greater good.
