Burnout for my role has left me crippled and almost 0% productivity available. Help.
So, a question.

I work for a certain company in the logistics industry, and the amount of workload has just increased. For a company that's been in the industry for about a decade or two, it still runs like a startup, and I was recently inducted into a role after the previous handler of 4 years left the company.

Practically 0% documentation was left to me about the process; there were some instructions given to me when I asked about them, but those don't encompass the entirety of the job role, and I am now left to rediscover them again.

Manager has given me this role because the person was leaving then and nobody was more capable than me at that point, but right now, I'm believing anyone would be more capable than I would.

How do you rebound from this, as I get anxiety attacks thinking about what mistake I will inevitably make, and facing them requires me to build up a lot of willpower that's already burnt out, and ends with me not being able to do everything that I should have been able to.

The increased workload back on my previous role was painful, but manageable as I knew the process. This time, I've been hit with the Peter Principle, incompetent and paralyzed.
