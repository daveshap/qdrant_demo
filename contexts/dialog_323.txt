ZORG: Zorg. Jean-Baptiste Emmanuel Zorg... nice to see you again
CORNELIUS: I remember you now..the so called art dealer.
ZORG: I'm glad you got your memory back, Father... Because you're going to need it... Where are the stones?
CORNELIUS: ...Why on earth do the stones interest you?
ZORG: Personally, they are of no interest to me, I'd rather sell weapons..but I have a customer... so tell me...
CORNELIUS: Even it I did know where the stones were I would never tell somebody like you.
ZORG: Why? What's wrong with me?
CORNELIUS: ...I'm a priest! I'm here to serve life, All you want to do is destroy it.
ZORG: Ah, Father... You are so wrong. Let me explain...
ZORG: ...would you like a drink?
CORNELIUS: No thank you.
ZORG: Follow me.. Life, which you so nobly serve, comes from destruction. Look at this empty glass.
