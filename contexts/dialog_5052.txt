SKIP: Crash Davis?
CRASH: The Crash Davis. ) And you, Larry Hockett, should recognize me 'cause five years ago in the Texas League when you were pitching for El Paso and I was hitting cleanup for Shreveport, you hung a curve on an 0-2 pitch of a 3-2 game in bottom of the 8th and I tattooed it over the Goodyear Tire sign, beat you 4-3-- and I got a free wheel alignment from Goodyear.
LARRY: Ohyeah. I shoulda throwed a slider. Damn, Crash, how're ya?
SKIP: I'm Joe Riggins. Sit down
CRASH: I'm too old for this shit. Why the hell am I back in A" ball?"
SKIP: 'Cause of Ebby Calvin LaLoosh. The Big Club's got a hundred grand in him-
LARRY: He's got a million dollar arm and a five cent head.
SKIP: --we had the gun on him tonight-- the last five pitches he threw were faster than the first five. 96 miles an hour, 98, 97, 97. 97. He's got the best young arm I've seen in 30 years.
LARRY: But he ain't quite sure which plane he's on, y'know what I mean...
SKIP: You been around, you're smart, you're professional, you know what it takes-- We want you to mature the kid.
