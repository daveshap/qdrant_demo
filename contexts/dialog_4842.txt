HAZMAT: You can't believe how much he's improved.
FRANK: How many times have you shocked him tonight?
HAZMAT: Fourteen. We finally got him a room upstairs. Should be up there in a couple of hours.
FRANK: What do you do, just have someone follow him around with a defribilator?
HAZMAT: That's good, Frank. No, but they might surgically implant one, about the size of my thumb. It goes near the shoulder here, with two electrodes connected to the heart. It sends a shock whenever it senses a drop in blood flow. Amazing, isn't it?
FRANK: A medical miracle.
