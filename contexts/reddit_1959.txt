For all of you seniors anxious about your acceptances...
You’re only three weeks away from Ivy Day and ten weeks away from finishing your high school education. 

Hang in there. There is a light at the end of the tunnel and I’m pretty sure it’s not a train. 

Relax and persevere. You’ve all earned the right to be in this position. And if no one in your life has told you recently, I’m proud of you.
