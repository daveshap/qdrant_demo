VENKMAN: You'll never regret this, Ray.
STANTZ: My parents left me that house, I was born there.
VENKMAN: You're not going to lose the house. Everybody has three mortgages these days.
STANTZ: But at nineteen percent interest! You didn't even bargain with the guy.
SPENGLER: Just for your information, Ray, the interest payments alone for the first five years come to over $75,000.
VENKMAN: Will you guys relax? We are on the threshold of establishing the indispensable defense science of the next decade - Professional Paranormal Investigations and Eliminations. The franchise rights alone will make us wealthy beyond your wildest dreams.
STANTZ: But most people are afraid to even report these things.
VENKMAN: Maybe. But no one ever advertised before.
