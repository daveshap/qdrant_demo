Will installing a beam under my shed's floor framing eliminate the bounce? The previous owner of my property built a roughly 16x12 outbuilding on posts. Besides doing many things in slightly stupid ways, the building overall isn't awful. I've converted it into a manhut where I drink beers and butcher deers. The floor bounces, and when I crawled underneath, I could have punched him. He used 2x6 floor joists, 19\" on center. I dont have much working room under the building and am on a budget.Here is my plan: cut holes in subflooring. Using auger or post hole diggers, bury 6x6 posts (3) in concrete, shoulder cut 6x6 and use 2x10s to create a beam in the middle of the joists. Think this will be enough to take out the bounce and be strong enough to have a couple of guys standing, along with lots of outdoors gear/equipment in there without risking breaking joists?Grade of soil shown in diagram. In the footprint diagram, the lowest clearance is in the top right corner.  The ground slopes from top right towards bottom left.
