SUSAN: To put is simply, the nanobot inside you is a microscopic machine encoded with information like a strand of messenger R.N.A. that is programmed to synthesize your molecules with the polyisoprenes of the assembler fluid, rebuilding your entire organic system on a molecular level.
O'BRIEN: That was 'simple'?
SUSAN: The nanobot combined your molecules with the plastic molecules in the white assembler fluid, so that on a molecular level you now have more in common with a Good Year tire than a human being.
O'BRIEN: Got it.
SUSAN: The problem is the by-product created by the process.
O'BRIEN: The waste.
