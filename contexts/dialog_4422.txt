SMECKER: What?
CHAFFEY: The press is everywhere outside. They're going nuts for these guys. What do you want to do?
SMECKER: You're not being charged. It's up to you. Do you want to talk to them?
CONNOR: Absolutely not.
MURPHY: No pictures, either.
SMECKER: Well, we could try the bag over the head thing. Walk you right out the front.
CONNOR: Our mother can see through bags.
