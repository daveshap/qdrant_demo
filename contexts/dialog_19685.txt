NINOTCHKA: Oo! Darling! Something is the matter.
LEON: You just made that trip from goats to grapes a little too fast.
NINOTCHKA: Oh, everything is so wonderful! It's getting farther and farther away!
LEON: What, darling?
NINOTCHKA: Thursday.
LEON: Yes. Don't worry. Everything will be all right.
NINOTCHKA: Comrades! Comrades!
LEON: Darling, darling... please!
NINOTCHKA: I must talk to my brothers!
LEON: Shhh! Shhh!
NINOTCHKA: Don't shush me. I am People! I want to make a speech. I want to overthrow the Duchess!
LEON: But, darling, you can't do that.
NINOTCHKA: Comrades! Good people of France!
LEON: Now, Ninotchka... please!
NINOTCHKA: They are all Duchesses here... thousands of Duchesses... and I am going to tell them.
LEON: Quite right... yes, yes, yes, but first you're going in that door and you're going to take a little spirits of ammonia and lie down.
NINOTCHKA: No speech?
LEON: No speech.
NINOTCHKA: I love you, my little Leonitchka!
LEON: And I adore you, Ninotchua.
