TREVOR: These hallucinations I'm having. I think they're more like memories coming back to me in a strange way.
ALLISON: Well that's not necessarily a bad thing is it?
TREVOR: If they're blocked memories... I'm starting to realize the reason why I blocked them out. Allison I think I really... screwed everything up.
ALLISON: Shh. Don't blame yourself Trevor. Please.
TREVOR: I miss her. I miss my wife.
