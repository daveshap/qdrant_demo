DWIGHT: I have taken care of everything, including medical supplies and blood storage. We want to be safe.
PROFESSOR: Right. What about condoms?
DWIGHT: Professor!
PROFESSOR: Hey, you're the one who brought up safety. I'm perfectly willing to go in raw.
DWIGHT: Would you please focus?
PROFESSOR: Fine. What's all this stuff?
DWIGHT: Well, this measures the amount of thermal imbalance within a room down to the tiniest molecular disturbances.
PROFESSOR: Are those cameras all throughout the house?
DWIGHT: Yes, I thought that it would be best.
PROFESSOR: Even in the bathroom?
PROFESSOR: So, if one of our little chickadees is taking a shower which one of these buttons do I press to get a close- up?
DWIGHT: That one.
PROFESSOR: After dinner, you and I will take shifts throughout the night. I don't want to chance miss anything.
HANSON: Excuse me, sir, but the students have started to arrive. Dinner will be ready shortly.
DWIGHT: Thanks, handyman.
HANSON: I'm the caretaker, not the handyman. Nice skates. Be careful. You don't want to fall and break something.
PROFESSOR: I'm going to change for dinner. I'll see you shortly.
DWIGHT: Sounds good. I'm just going to run up to my room. Hop in the shower. Jump into my jogging suit, and I'll be right there.
