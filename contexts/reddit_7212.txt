How to ask for training compensation?
TLDR: began job in law firm 3 months ago, never worked in legal. Trying to manage teaching myself the law side, while also learning what makes up the job. Was told this week that I am training a new employee. I don’t know the job in it’s entirety itself, let alone to teach someone. 


Started at a law firm about 3 months ago completing ‘signings’ (when the clients sign their papers. My job is highly interactive , being a go between of the lawyer and who he retains. 

Since I began I’ve been thrown into the work: being forced to complete the signings alone with the clients 4 weeks after starting. This is going through 300 page documents explaining their life’s work and hoping I do it correctly. I’ve voiced my opinion many times to my office manager and boss about how I don’t feel comfortable and like I’m educated enough about the material, but they believe in me. 

I was told this week that I’m going to be training a new client liaison, who will do the same job as me since we are so busy. I just hit my 3 month mark, and still have multiple questions everyday about the job I’m doing. 

How do I go about asking for more compensation because of this additional training aspect? Or do I even? I feel so out of touch with ‘law” because I’ve never worked in this sort of field. Not only am I learning the actual meat of what I’m going over, but I’m still learning the process of how to go over the stuff.
