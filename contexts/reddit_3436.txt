Ever miss someone that was once interested in you, wish they still were and/or wondering if they ever will be again?
Flair: half venting and half discussion 

I’m especially talking someone who initiated/showed interest in you first, you liked them back, and they either lost interest or got with someone else (and lost interest after getting with that someone else).  Especially in cases of either almost dating or dating briefly.   And with the former especially, without properly dating at all, it’s painful because you go from clicking to almost being strangers.  There was a potential for a connection that didn’t come to fruition-even when you try staying friends you guys are now at ground zero since you only barely got to know each other.  You’re stuck with all these feelings to the point that it seems too good to be true that this person was interested in you a while back, despite them having to pursue you/even if they were quite keen on you back then.  Hearing stories of people who met the person they used to like and having those feelings resurface make you wonder if the one in your case will ever be interested again, but the fact that they changed their mind about dating you makes it doubtful.
