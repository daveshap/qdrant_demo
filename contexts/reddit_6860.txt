Only a high school diploma but 8 years of experience. How hard is this going to be for me?
Hi all. I was with my company for 8 years. Started in the call center and worked my way up to an operations management position. The company was in the buisness of travel and unfortunately my position was eliminated. I am devastated. 

I filed for unemployment today but am starting to look for jobs. I feel without a degree under my belt, I am essentially screwed. I’m 29 and unfortunately had to work instead of go to school to help support my family. 

I know it’s going to be hard to find a Job due to COVID but I’m worried that it’s going to be even harder to find something due to have no college degree. Especially one that paid as well as my last employer. 

Any recommendations? Is this going to be damn near impossible for me? I still feel like this is a nightmare I’m going to wake up from, still can’t believe it.
