I'm waking up tomorrow.
I was sure of it. Tonight was supposed to be night. My depression was always there, but something told me that tonight was the night I would end it all and relieve myself from this pain.

But I didn't. 

I found myself crying for 2 hours, and then finally picking up the phone for the Suicide Hotline. I spoke to the most wonderful person on the other end. He told me I was strong, he told me I deserved to live, he told me I was a good person. He gave me a new perspective on how to tackle life. He saved my life.

So, for now, I put the tools away, the notes away, and will not send those texts tonight. Because, for better or worse,

I'm waking up tomorrow.
