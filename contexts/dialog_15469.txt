TED: Joanna, go be a mother. Get married, have kids. Don't get married, have kids. Do whatever you want. I don't give a damn. Just leave me out of it--and leave my baby out of it.
JOANNA: Ted, if you can't discuss this rationally--
TED: Joanna, go fuck yourself!
TED: Look, she walked out on her own child, right? That's desertion, right? Mr. Shaunessy, I'm telling you it's an open and shut case.
SHAUNESSY: First, there's no such thing as an open and shut case. Especially where custody is involved. Got it?
