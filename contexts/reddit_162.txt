Relationship with big age gaps.
Hey, It's the first time I post and it's because I want to know how bad can a relationship with a big age gap can affect and turn into abuse trauma.
The thing is that when I was 15 years old (I'm 17 at the time) I met this guy who was 9 years older than me and we started a relationship, I didn't knew it was that bad, he made me think it was normal and that "age is just a number", I turned him into a father figure, we broke up and I started a relationship with another guy, one my age and I noticed how different things were, like, I didn't pictured him as a father but just as my couple, like normal relationships are.
Months after I got back with my ex (this guy my age broke up w/me because he didn't felt good enough) and lost my virginity to him, he was nicer than back then when I met him, but he reminded me so much of my mom's ex-boyfriend, who molested me in a sexual way when I was younger, so he often brought memories and traumas back and when I finally decided to leave him forever (i left in november of the past year) noticed how much he triggered me and that our relationship wasn't even normal in the first place, now even a slight mention of him makes me feel very anxious at the point I cry remembering when he was mean to me.
I want to know if this kind of reaction is normal or is just that I had a different experience and relationships with age difference are normal.
P.D: Sorry if my writing doesn't make sense or is unnecessarily long, English is not my mother language but this is the only place I know I could have an advice.
