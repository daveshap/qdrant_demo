STEED: Drat. Someone wants to implicate you in this affair, Mrs. Peel. Any idea who?
EMMA: No idea who. No idea why ...
STEED: Teddy bears, cuckoo clocks, toys All children's things ...
EMMA: ... Or grown-ups, who still like to be children.
STEED: Quite. Any childhood friends? Enemies?
EMMA: Not to speak of. Peter and I were both loners. There was nobody.
STEED: Very well. I have a friend who might be of assistance. He's at the Ministry. We'd better be careful.
EMMA: I'm a wanted woman, I know ...
STEED: His name's Jones. 'Invisible' Jones.
EMMA: Why's he called 'Invisible'?
STEED: You'll find out.
EMMA: Aren't you coming?
STEED: I'll catch you up. Don't worry; he's expecting you.
