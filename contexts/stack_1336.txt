How to wire humidifier to furnace I have a Goodman high efficient furnace with a carrier humidifier attached to the back. The humidifier wasn't working because the solenoid coil was burned, so I replaced it with a new solenoid. The humidifier has a control panel mounted to the airduct. I'm trying to wire this humidifier up. I do have a 24volt transformer, but no HUM connection on the board. I noticed on the wiring diagram for the furnace it says to wire the humidifier to the C connection on the RYG...etc. I'm lost here. Any help would be appreciated. Thank you.
