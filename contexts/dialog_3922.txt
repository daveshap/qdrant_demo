HELEN: Let's eat our cake.
CALVIN: Yeah. Let's dig in!
HELEN: Elbows, Son.
ADAM: Sorry, Mom!
HELEN: You never know. You may someday dine at the White House with the president.
CALVIN: If we still have one.
HELEN: Yes...
CALVIN: You know, when we do go up...I'm going to miss this old place. How 'bout you, hon?
HELEN: Would you excuse me?
CALVIN: Sure.
CALVIN: In the generator room again?
HELEN: Oh, yes. It just fascinates me how all these things work.
CALVIN: I know exactly what you mean! Hey, honey?
