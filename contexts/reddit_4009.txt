You can't make someone like you.
I see so many people on here upset about being repeatedly rejected. Whether it is people having trouble getting anyone to initially notice them, getting a second date, or ghosting them. They come on here and vent their frustration and usually are met with good advice from people who are genuinely trying to help. Some people suggest working out to build self confidence. Get a hobby to become more interesting. Lose weight. Gain weight. Buy some nicer clothes. Make an interesting online profile. Stop online dating and go to a bar. Practice better hygiene. Be aloof. Be more open. Wait to text back...... the list of advice goes on and the complaints of rejection keep coming.  
To the point. It's great that the people having issues are looking to better yourself. But... oh yes always a but.  
The common theme I see with all the people having these issues is definitely not lack of effort. It is the fact that people are trying to take this advice and change their habits to attract the interest of others. Absolutely the wrong reason to make a lifestyle change. And it will absolutely lead to more rejection and more bitterness. 
Ever seen an asshole... and I mean total asshole that has no problem attracting that dream guy or girl you want. It's because that asshole is totally comfortable in their skin. They know who they are and they are true to themselves. Now I'm not saying be an asshole... I am saying dont change who you are for the sake of someone else, ever. 
If you want to change yourself because you dont like something about yourself, have at it. But the second you compromise your values for the sake of someone else, I can guarantee people sense that, and they sense it as a weakness, and it's not an attractive one.
