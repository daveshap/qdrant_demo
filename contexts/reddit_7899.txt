Independent research study?
Hi everyone,  I need some advice.  I am not sure if i will get accepted in my phd program so I am thinking of different solutions. One Ideas that I had was doing research at my current job as a side project or side job. It might let me get funded and etc. I am worried about bringing this up to my mentor and may need some advice to make them supportive of the idea. The cool thing is the data I get could be used for a dissertation for my PhD. So it would be applicable for my future plans that I can set into motion now as a master student regardless of my acceptance.
