Just got laidoff from a pretty shit job. Should i even be sad?
I can't help but feel like i should be because of the amount of effort i put into whatever was needed to do, which was just retail and stocking and restocking shelves and stuff. I was only laidoff because i didnt have reliable transportation and i missed too many days i guess. I plan on buying a car this coming week and i also have another interview scheduled for Tuesday that i have a family member working at. I'll also be able to earn ny CNA license there while being paid for the classes. But there's no guarantee that I'll get it though. I dunno.
