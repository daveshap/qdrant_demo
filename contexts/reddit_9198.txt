You all think you're so successful for paying off these debts & balances.
Well good, because you are.

You didn't let mistakes and moments of ignorance or hardship in life keep you in a bad position. You're all actively working to pull yourself out of a hole--however big or small--and improve your situation. Don't let anyone minimize your success or progress; every victory counts & I'm proud of y'all.

Edit: Thanks for the silver kind stranger!
