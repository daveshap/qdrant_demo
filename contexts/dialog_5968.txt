HOMER: I miss things. I miss... people. I miss reading to the boys.
CANDY: But you had so much *responsibility*.
HOMER: I never *asked* for any responsibility.
CANDY: Just a little privacy.
CANDY: Privacy is exactly the point of drive- in movies.
HOMER: Did you come here with Wally--to *not* watch movies?
CANDY: Sometimes... movies mostly bore Wally.
HOMER: Ah-ha. So what is that--a radio?
CANDY: The *speaker*. For the movie sound.
