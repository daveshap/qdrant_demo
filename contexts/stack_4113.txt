Philippines visa on arrival with Singapore eVisa I am a citizen of India. I have a Singapore 35-day multiple-entry visa. Am I eligible to get a visa on arrival in the Philippines, without going to Singapore on this visa? Is it mandatory to go to Singapore on this eVisa once to get a visa on arrival in the Philippines?I've never been to Singapore or Philippines before.I have a confirmed return ticket.
