Why cant people just be honest about not being interested in you? Instead they just lie and ghost...its so immature
I went on a hinge date with a girl. We were having a great time. The next day, I call to ask to hang out again sometime and she agrees and says she needs to check her work schedule (works at a nightclub) and would let me know when she would be free. This is literally the day after when my city announced all bars/restaurants would be shut down lol...girl you aint working, the whole city aint working...but i just said sure okay hmu when you figure it out. 

I tried to start a convo the other day to just ask her to be straight up and im just completely ghosted. Like wtf man? Why cant you just be honest and say youre not interested so we can both move on....

I just started online dating this year so this is my first time ive been ghosted. Im glad i was always honest about not wanting to continue dating with the people ive met online and dated , instead of ghost them. Man it does suck to be on the receiving end...

I guess in the end i dodged a bullet. Anyone one does that crap is too immature for me to date.
