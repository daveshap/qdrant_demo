RICKY: Dip?
WELSHMAN: Yeah. This shit's fucking brilliant. I just fucking love the fact that you have kids driving around in pickup trucks with a mouthful of this shit, speeding their brains out. I gotta bring a case of it home to my mates. It's illegal back home, you know.
HORRACE: No shit?
WELSHMAN: Does anyone want another?
HORRACE: You want another drink?
RICKY: I'll get it.
WELSHMAN: Who's up for a night on the town.
HORRACE: Sure. Anyplace in particular?
WELSHMAN: I hear the China Club is a laugh.
