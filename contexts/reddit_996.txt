I graduated college today
I fucking did it. 5.5 years, 3 schools and 2 majors later I finally graduated with my bachelor’s degree and have a full time job lined up. My anxiety was so bad this last semester all I wanted to do was take a semester off and push everything back because I didn’t think I could get through it, but I did. And now I’m done. I’m just proud of myself and wanted to share. For anyone who thinks they can’t achieve their goals because of this debilitating illness, you can. Don’t let it stop you. 

Edit: thank you all so much for your kind words and support! I also majored in risk management & insurance for those asking.
