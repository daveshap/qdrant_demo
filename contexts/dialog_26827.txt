DICKIE: You're breaking my ribs!
RIPLEY: What?
DICKIE: You're breaking my ribs!
DICKIE: I could fuck this icebox I love it so much. What were you actually doing in New York?
RIPLEY: I played piano in a few places.
DICKIE: That's one job, you told me a lot of jobs.
RIPLEY: A few places -- that's a few jobs. Anyway, I don't want to think about New York.
DICKIE: The mysterious Mr Ripley. Marge and I spend hours speculating. Cold beer. Thank you Dad.
RIPLEY: Copy out from here...
DICKIE: I love the fact you brought Shakespeare with you and no clothes. Ermelinda says you wash the same shirt out every night. Is that true?
RIPLEY: No! I've got more than one shirt!
DICKIE: She can do that stuff for you. Anyway, just wear some of my things, wear anything you want, most of it's ancient.
RIPLEY: Now your signature. Not Dickie". Your signature."
DICKIE: Without the glasses you're not even ugly. I don't need them because I never read. How do I look.
RIPLEY: Like Clark Kent. Now Superman.
DICKIE: I know. I write like a child.
RIPLEY: Pretty vile. See this: The S and the T, do you see? -- fine, vulnerable -- that's pain, that's secret pain.
DICKIE: It must be a deep secret, cause I don't know about it.
RIPLEY: Your handwriting -- nothing more naked. See -- nothing's quite touching the line -- that's vanity.
DICKIE: Well we certainly know that's true.
DICKIE: Do you have any brothers?
RIPLEY: No, no brothers, no sisters.
DICKIE: Me neither. Nor does Marge. All only children -- what does that mean?
RIPLEY: Means we never shared a bath. I'm cold. Can I get in?
DICKIE: No!
RIPLEY: I didn't mean with you in it.
DICKIE: Okay, you get in. I'm like a prune anyway.
