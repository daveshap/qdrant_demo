PATRICIA: Hi, Sweetie.
MILES: Hard to believe I know. I'm sure you are frequently mistaken for sisters.
MARYLIN: He'll regret this.
MILES: Have you ever met Mr. Rexroth?
PATRICIA: No. I haven't. But I've been out of town. Hello, Rex. Hello there.
MILES: You were never invited to meet your son-in-law?
PATRICIA: No. Uh uh. I don't think so. Hmm? No. Well... no.
RUTH: Objection, Your Honor. This isn't about Mrs. Rexroth's filial obligations.
JUDGE: Sustained.
MILES: Did you know Mrs. Rexroth was married?
PATRICIA: Of course. Of course she was married. What else would she be? Single? I don't think so.
PATRICIA: Let me tell you something about Patty.
MILES: Who's Patty.""
PATRICIA: Oh. That's her name. Patricia. Like mine. I was Pat and she was Patty. But she changed it after seeing Some Like It Hot." To Marylin. After Marylin Monroe."
MILES: I see. And what were you going to tell us about Patty slash Marylin?
PATRICIA: When she was a tiny girl? And people asked her what she wanted to be when she grew up? She never said the usual things little girls say -- like -- nurse -- ballerina -- anchorwoman? She always said -- When I grow up
MILES: Divorce was her childhood aspiration?
PATRICIA: Well, not just divorce. She used to say I want to be divorced from some big dumb rich guy..." And I guess her dream is coming true. I'm happy for you Patty"
MARYLIN: It was like that scene in The Godfather. Frankie Pentangeli is called to testify against the Family. And he's in court, and he looks into the spectators gallery, and sees his Brother. They brought the brother from Sicily. And Frankie can't say a word. He can't testify. That's what it was like seeing Pat in there. I couldn't even have Ruth cross examine her.
RAMONA: Why do you think she did it?
MARYLIN: Maybe she wanted a free trip to LA. Maybe they offered her money. Massey is very seductive. Who knows.
RAMONA: Maybe they put a horse head in her bed?
SARAH: That stinks. They left you with absolutely nothing. It makes you wonder about the entire legal system. Like Rodney King.
MARYLIN: They bought her speech. If I was only in it for Rex's money, he shouldn't have to give me any.
RAMONA: That doesn't make sense. It's like punishing you for being goal oriented.
SARAH: Well, you can live here as long as you want. Do you have any plans?
MARYLIN: Nothing specific, but I'll have my own place soon.
SARAH: So, Marylin. Is that what you said when you were a little girl?
MARYLIN: Probably. Every woman in my life was divorced at least twice. What was I supposed to say. Anthropologist?
RAMONA: I begged you to have a baby!
MARYLIN: In the Godfather, after the courtroom scene, Frankie Pentangeli opens his veins in the bathtub.
SARAH: You're not...
MARYLIN: No. I'll see some blood before this is over, but it won't be mine.
MILES: She got absolutely nothing. Zero. Zip.
KENNETH: So. I won't be seeing her? Your clients usually visit me after the settlement.
MILES: Not this one. Not unless her HMO covers plastic surgery, which, incidentally, she does not need.
KENNETH: Everyone needs plastic surgery. You need it.
MILES: I don't need it.
KENNETH: You want Botox?
MILES: What the hell is Botox?
KENNETH: It's a form of botulism. I just inject it into your forehead, and it paralyzes your eyebrows so you can't raise them...
MILES: Why in God's name would I want...?
KENNETH: No frown lines. New watch?
MILES: It's a LeCoultre Revers. You can flip the face, and set it for two time zones.
KENNETH: Why would you need two time zones? You never leave Beverly Hills.
MILES: It was a gift from a client.
KENNETH: Set one side for Bel Air.
MILES: Botox. Christ. We had aspirations when we were in college.
KENNETH: We did not.
MILES: You were going to be a Cardiac Surgeon. I was going to clerk for the Supreme Court.
KENNETH: I was going to play golf. You were going to have Asian girlfriends.
MILES: Denial is not a river in Egypt.
KENNETH: You're in check.
MILES: I should be in therapy.
MILES: Yes. Your husband did show remarkable foresight in taking those pictures. And, yes, absent a swimming pool, the presence of the pool man would appear to be suspicious. But Bonnie, who is the real victim here? Let me suggest the following. Your husband, who on a prior occasion slapped you -- beat you --
BONNIE: Well, I wouldn't say --
MILES: Your husband, who has beaten you -- repeatedly --
BONNIE: He --
MILES: Please -- was at the time brandishing your firearm, trying in his rage to shoot an acquaintance -- friend of long standing --
BONNIE: They hate each other --
MILES: So he says now! But if not for your cool headed intervention, his tantrum might have ended this schmoe's life and ruined his own... As for the sexual indiscretion which he imagined had taken place, wasn't it in fact he who had been sleeping with the pool man?
