Dirt in the edibles I am looking for a word/phrase to say about having dirt in edibles which got into edibles at the time of their preparation (home made or manufactured in a factory).I have two questions:Which of these words - dirt/dust/mud, is suitable here?<blockquote>  There are dirt/dust/mud particles in these edibles.</blockquote>These tiny dust particles rub against the teeth or come in between the teeth when we bite or chew such edibles. (What's is the word/phrase for this?)I bite into such edibles and feel the dirt in between my teeth. What word/phrase can I say to describe such edibles so as to fill in the blank in this sentence.<blockquote>  These edibles are ____.</blockquote>Edit: Is the word 'muddy' correct?, because these dirt particles are tiny.
