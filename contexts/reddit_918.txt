Anyone else have constant anxiety rather than attacks?
I hear a lot of people with anxiety talk about having anxiety attacks or panic attacks, but it’s never really been that way with me. I just seem to constantly be on edge with everything, even small stuff, and every once in a while I’ll have “waves” of increased anxiety for a few days. Does anyone else have mild or moderate stress at all times instead of actual anxiety attacks?
