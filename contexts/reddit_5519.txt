Any former current Coast Guard members
Hi I was wondering if anyone had some insight as to what a good base level of training or certification would be needed to work with the Canadian Coast Guard ? More specifically I have always wanted to work on the smaller craft, FRC, zodiacs but open to other options. I have some sea time and experience operating vessels 14T and under but have no official certification other than marine advanced first aid. Any advice, opinions, help etc would be awesome. Thanks.
