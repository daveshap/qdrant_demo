PLUCHINSKY: I'm filing charges against that mother-
WINTERS: Can it, Pluchinsky. And shove some cotton up your nose.
REILLY: What was-? Why...?
GLASS: That cop who bought it... you didn't tell us he was your partner.
T.J.: We've lost brothers too, we know what that's like.
GLASS: Let's get something straight. We're doing you a favor. You're not exactly a guy we want around explosives.
REILLY: What?
GLASS: This isn't bumper cars, it's brain surgery. You wanna work with us, you do it our way, understand?
REILLY: Now wait just a fucking-
GLASS: Be cool around my men, they don't trust strangers. And try not to swear so much, it's unattractive.
GLASS: By the way, I'm Glass. This is T.J., and Pooch.
REILLY: Mike Reilly.
