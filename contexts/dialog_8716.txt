SMITH: Hey...
WEIR: Say this paper represents space-time, and you want to get from point A" here... ...to "point B
STARCK: A straight line.
WEIR: Wrong. The shortest distance between two points...
WEIR: ...is zero. That's what the singularity does: it folds space, so that point A and point B coexist in the same space and time. After the ship passes through this gateway, space returns to normal. It's called a gravity drive.
JUSTIN: How do you know all this?
WEIR: I built it.
COOPER: I can see why they sent you along.
JUSTIN: So if the ship didn't blow up, what happened?
WEIR: It was the ship's maiden voyage, to test the drive. The Event Horizon moved to safe distance using ion thrusters. They received the go-ahead to activate the gravity drive. And the ship vanished from all our scopes. No radar contact, no enhanced optical, no radio contact of any kind. They disappeared without a trace. Until now.
MILLER: Where has it been for the last seven years?
WEIR: That's what we're here to find out.
