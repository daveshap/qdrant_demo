Why does it seem like so many people are trying to get out of IT fields?
Lay it on me, I want to know because I’ve been kicking myself since freshman year (senior now) of my bachelors for not going into computer science, cyber security, or IT.  

I’ve been trying to think of every possible way to get a Masters in one of those fields instead, but then I see a LOT of people posting on here trying to get out of the field.

Why is that? What am I missing? It seems like a constantly growing and hiring field with lots of potential for working in different sectors.
