Im really stressed
So im 13 and i just got accepted into an advanced math class. At first i was fine but than we got double the homework than a regular class and its so hard on me. I know the material very well and im getting good grades but i just feel really stressed and i just started puberty, I cant relax at all. When I go home. One of my two friends moved and middle school feels like hell.
