ARNIE: This place is swept twice a day. I learned that in Miami in '85. Then the U.S. shut down the whole Caribbean, but it's a big game of wack-a-mole. Knock it down in Miami, it pops up here. And San Diego is so much more relaxing.
HELENA: Arnie, I need money. Somebody threatened my children. They want a first payment of three million dollars.
ARNIE: Helena, if I had it I would give it to you, but I don't have that kind of money.
HELENA: Arnie, help me. Doesn't anyone owe us money?
ARNIE: Yes, I told you before, there are people who owe you money but they're not paying. There's too much heat on Carl.
HELENA: Please. Tell me who Carl sells to.
ARNIE: Even if I knew I wouldn't tell you. You do not want to come into contact with these people. Only Carl knows who they are. That's his real asset. Ruiz doesn't know them. They don't know Ruiz. Church and State.
HELENA: What about legitimate businesses? We own a construction concern, real estate --
ARNIE: Laundromats for the washing of money. Unfortunately, Carl had only one successful business.
HELENA: Don't you have some good news? Isn't there something positive you could say.
HELENA: Sometimes I wonder what I'll do if Carl doesn't get out. I'm not very adept at being on my own. I've always had a man in my life. Always.
ARNIE: I remember when I first met you: little Helen Watts from the wrong side of somewhere. I had a feeling even then that your survival instincts were pretty well honed.
HELENA: I'm glad you think so, but I'm picturing a debt-ridden, thirty-two year-old mother whose ex-husband is being compared to Pablo Escobar. And I'm wondering who would want to be with someone like that?
