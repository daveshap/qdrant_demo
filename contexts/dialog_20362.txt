RIPLEY: Thank you...
MAURICE: Not so fast, Dick. Starting now, there's gonna be an across the board cost a living increase.

MAURICE: Year ago, I come in here on credit card fraud, but after I shanked that loudmouth pussy on the yard the other day, my Dunn & Broadstreet, has gone way the fuck up.
RIPLEY: I think it's Dunn & <u>Brad</u>street. But then, I could be wrong...
MAURICE: Whoever. The point is, prices are goin' up, too. Better get your little black book out, Richard. We got some business to talk about.
