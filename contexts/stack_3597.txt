Can information sent over unencrypted http still be seen if I'm on an encrypted wifi? I was booking a haircut online and noticed that when they made me sign up for an account, the credentials were not being encrypted (or at least that's what firefox was telling me). It's not a huge deal because it's just an account that I use to book haircuts, but it got me wondering, how much of a security risk is this if I'm on a WPA2 encrypted wifi (and can be reasonably sure no attackers know the password)? Are there other points of attack at which the data could be seen besides sniffing the packets over wifi?
