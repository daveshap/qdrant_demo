What is the end-game of Oregon politicians denying quorum?
So the long and short is that several Oregon lawmakers have decided to abandon the state capital in order to avoid allowing a quorum on a climate change bill: [https://www.oregonlive.com/politics/2019/06/oregon-senate-republicans-walkout-could-kill-hundreds-of-bills.html](https://www.oregonlive.com/politics/2019/06/oregon-senate-republicans-walkout-could-kill-hundreds-of-bills.html)

Without a quorum they cannot hold any votes, and their constitution mandates all bills not passed by June 30 to be considered dead. They would need to reintroduce any legislation and get it approved all over again.

In this particular example, it's extra spicy because at least one lawmaker seems to have insinuated they will kill those attempting to return them by force, and several militia groups have made [similar threats](https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/oregon-statehouse-shut-down-after-lawmakers-team-up-with-right-wing-militias/ar-AADh0mB?ocid=spartanntp).

This raises several questions for me:

* Are these walkouts legal? Could these lawmakers be charged even if they return voluntarily?
* As a follow-up to that: can these lawmakers be dismissed from their posts without a vote? If not, are there supposed to be any measures in place to prevent these actions? Seems like it would be very easy and very exploitable to just wait until shortly before this deadline every session and then just stage a walkout to deny the majority, especially if votes are required to remove you and those take time to arrange. What solutions have other states or democracies found to this kind of problem?

In regards to the threats:

* Who is normally responsible for returning these lawmakers to do their jobs?
* If threats are escalated or violence is begun, is this considered a purely domestic matter to Oregon and their police are the ones to resolve, or could the National Guard or federal armed forces become involved? I suppose the FBI is also possible since some of them appear to have crossed state lines.

ETA: Modified the threats statement.
