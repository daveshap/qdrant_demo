CLAYTON: What in...?
GREENHILL: Captain Clayton...Captain!
CLAYTON: Go on! Whyn't you have your bugler sound the charge while you're at it??
GREENHILL: Sir?
CLAYTON: Never mind...Your pa know you're out here?
GREENHILL: Yes, sir...Troop's about ten miles back...The Colonel sent me looking for you...
CLAYTON: Well you found me...Good work, son...Good work.
GREENHILL: If there's anything I can do, sir...
CLAYTON: God forbid...No, son, you flog on back and tell your pa where we're at...and where he's at...
GREENHILL: But he knows THAT, sir...Can't I stay, sir?
CLAYTON: All right...But keep your eye on me, boy...I'm the hard case you're up against here -- not these childish savages...If you don't hear me first time I holler, you better read my mind...I don't aim to raise no two hollers on any subject at hand...
GREENHILL: Yes, sir...
