What are some lesser-known trades?
I have seen a lot of posts/comments about how the trades are a great option right now and how welding. plumbing, HVAC etc. all pay well and give good job security. I am curious to see if anyone knows about some lesser known trades like elevator repair? I like the idea of trade work but am not sure if I want to be an electrician or a welder, exactly..
