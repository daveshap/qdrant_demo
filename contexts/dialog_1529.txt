ANDY: Uncle Terrence?
TERRENCE: Andy? Andy is that you?
ANDY: Yeah. Look, uncle Terrence -
TERRENCE: Andy, I have to tell you about the dream I had - or that I'm still having - it feels like a systemic, physio- tropic reaction to some drug, maybe a triptamine or phenethylamine derivative. But it is hyper-real. I'd swear my legs had been cut off or... wait a second... I'm getting a strange meta-physical buzz. Shit. I'm, uh, dead, aren't I?
ANDY: Sort of...
TERRENCE: Undead. Right. Sort of an ectocosmic manifestation. What a pisser. Tell you one thing though, Timothy Leary will be jealous as hell.
ANDY: Great, but listen, I need to know where you hid the ADM?
TERRENCE: The ADM! Be careful, Andy. It's very powerful. How do you know about it?
ANDY: I went to St. Severin church. Now look -
TERRENCE: Oh shit! No! Andy, don't let them take me back there!
ANDY: The ADM! Quickly! Where is it?!
ANDY: Where is it! Please!
TERRENCE: AHHH!! The wine cellar!! In a bottle of Chateau Margaux. A metal cylinder... Don't... Don't - AAAAH!
