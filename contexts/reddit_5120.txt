What is the weirdest or most BS explanation you've been given for not getting a job?
I just got a rejection email after an interview stating that the primary reason they didn't offer was because they wanted a local candidate. I live 2 blocks away from their office, my home is closer to their office than their company parking lot is. 

This is probably the only time I would've actually preferred a vague rejection from a do-not-reply account. I'm not even upset, just confused about whether they got me mixed up with a different candidate, or just wrote the first excuse they could think of.
