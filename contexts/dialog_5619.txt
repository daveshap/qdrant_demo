REGGIE: Go on, please -- five men -- $250,000 -- the French Underground --
BARTHOLOMEW: Yes. The five men. They were, of course, your husband, Charles, the three men who showed up at his funeral yesterday, and Carson Dyle. But something went wrong and they were unable to locate their contact. It must have been at that point that they decided to steal the money.
REGGIE: Steal it how?
BARTHOLOMEW: By burying it, and then reporting that the Germans had captured it. All they had to do was come back after the war, dig it up and split it five ways -- a quarter of a million dollars with no questions asked.
REGGIE: May I have a cigarette, please?
