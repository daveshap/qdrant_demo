PAUL: What are you doing? You're going to be late.
LETTY: I'm calling in sick.
PAUL: You don't have a fever.
LETTY: I don't feel like going to work today.
PAUL: Won't it be hard for them to get a substitute this late?
PAUL: But what about that math project?
LETTY: Paul, I just can't go. Is that OK with you or am I committing some horrible crime?
PAUL: Forget I asked.
LETTY: I'm sorry. I'm just...I'm so tired lately.
PAUL: Maybe you ought to see a doctor.
LETTY: No, it's not like that.
LETTY: It's just I've got those parent conferences, and I'm supposed to set up the math program by next week. And shopping for Ruth's dress and that, that engagement dinner.
PAUL: You can get out of the dinner.
LETTY: No, I can't. I've already convinced both Mom and Dad to come.
PAUL: Come on, Letty. It'll get done.
LETTY: I don't think so.
PAUL: Of course it will. Remember the big talent show you planned last year? And what about the Christmas benefit when Santa canceled at the last minute? But you still pulled it off.
LETTY: Yeah.
PAUL: You just need to get more organized. L
