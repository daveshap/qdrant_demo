BECKER: In where?
STARKS: [Uncertainly] In that thing...the Jacket.
BECKER: We were forced to use restrains if that's what you're referring to.
STARKS: That wasn't a fucking restraint.
BECKER: Actually, that's exactly what our equipment is.
BECKER: Relax.
STARKS: Don't act like I don't know what's real. [Beat] I'm not the one that's crazy here.
BECKER: [Pointedly] Of course you're not.
BECKER: You're just suffering from delusions that are unfortunately part of your condition.
STARKS: Don't give me that. I know what's real, goddamnit! You strapped me in something and stuck me in a drawer.
STARKS: I didn't dream it. I may have been asleep but it wasn't a dream. BECKER sits down in a CHAIR, half-shrouded in the light.
BECKER: I had a patient a few years ago. His name was Ted Casey...
STARKS: I don't give a shit about your patient!
BECKER: I wasn't pausing to see if you did. [Beat] But, incidentally, you should, because you're birds of a feather.
