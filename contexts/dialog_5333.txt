NICKY: Ginger called me.
ACE: Yeah.
NICKY: I just told you. She called me.
ACE: And what'd she want?
NICKY: She was afraid to call you.
ACE: Yeah, she's with that cocksucker again... and they got Amy.
GINGER: Well, that's why I'm here. She wants to come back, but she's afraid you're gonna whack her out.
ACE: Yeah, they're gonna kidnap my kid. What do you want?
NICKY: I know. Why didn't you come to me? I mean, this is family, it ain't business. Meanwhile, you make calls back home. Sammy, it makes us look bad out here, you know what I mean? Back and forth, this one and that one, and, in the meantime, she's gone anyway. Am I right?
ACE: I don't know. What am I gonna do with this woman? I don't know... She's drivin' me fuckin' crazy.
NICKY: I think if you, uh, okay it, you know, assure her that she's gonna be all right, she'll come back.
ACE: She's driving me fuckin' crazy.
NICKY: Well, once you get her here, you think about it, you know? But get the kid back here. She wants to come back. That's the, uh, that's the main thing here. You want your kid, don't you? Huh?
ACE: Hello.
GINGER: Hi, it's me. Just who you wanted to talk to, right?
ACE: Listen...
ACE: ...uh-uh-uh - I'm not gonna ask you where you are, just please, put Amy on a plane. Just put her on right away, any plane to get her here right away...
ACE: ...please. That's all I'm askin' you.
GINGER: Do you... I mean... I don't think she should go by herself.
ACE: What do you mean?
GINGER: What I mean is, you think if, uh, do you think if I came back... do you think you could forgive me?
ACE: Uh, I don't know. I gotta tell you, I don't know.
GINGER: Right.
GINGER: I under-understand that. I-I know I fucked up.
ACE: What about the money? Uh, where's the box?
GINGER: I gotta tell ya...
