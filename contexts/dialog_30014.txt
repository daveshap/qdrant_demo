BOBBY: I wanted to talk.
GRACE: I don't think we have anything to talk about.
BOBBY: What about us?
GRACE: There is no us, remember?
BOBBY: Except I can't get you out of my head, Grace.
GRACE: Stop it.
BOBBY: Why? Am I making you hot, or does the truth scare you?
GRACE: Because I know you're full of shit.
BOBBY: I mean it, Grace. I'm getting out of here, and I want to take you with me.
GRACE: I thought you couldn't get your car.
BOBBY: I could if I had Jake's money.
GRACE: Is that what changed your mind? The money?
BOBBY: I don't give a damn about the money. I want you, and I want to get us out of this shithole. There's only one way to do that.
GRACE: Are you sure?... About me, I mean?
BOBBY: I came back for you; this morning I came back. Before I even knew about the money. You're what I want. The only reason I stormed off is because you spooked me talking about Jake. But I've had nothing but time to think about it. It keeps coming back to you and me and us getting the hell out of here. But we've got to get the money, baby. We get the money, I get the car, then we get the hell out.
GRACE: You said you couldn't kill anybody.
BOBBY: We don't have to kill him. Just knock him out and tie him up 'till we get away. It was your idea, remember? I'm doing this for you. I'm doing this so you can fly...fly like a bird.
BOBBY: Grace ... Grace?
GRACE: After dark. I'll leave the back door unlocked.
JAKE: Who was that on the phone?
GRACE: Wrong number.
JAKE: You spent a long time talking for a wrong number. But then you make friends so easily. Don't you, Grace?
GRACE: I put up new drapes, Jake.
JAKE: I know. I was here when your apprentice was helping you. Remember?
GRACE: You never said anything. About the drapes.
JAKE: They look nice.
GRACE: You haven't even looked at them once.
JAKE: They look nice.
GRACE: I picked them out for you, Jake. I thought you would like the colors.
JAKE: What the hell you looking at, girl?
GRACE: Nothing, Jake. Absolutely nothing.
