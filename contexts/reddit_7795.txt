Currently under quarantine, and writing seems to be the hardest this time.
I haven't written anything in the past weeks, our country has extended quarantine and schools are closed. I have been working from home, started gardening, and composting, I get to walk in our neighborhood every morning, I started learning baking, and I have been binge watching shows after work. Keeping a routine keeps me sane, and learning new things keeps me distracted. I know I should make use of the time while am home, but I feel like writing feels more daunting at this time. I don't know if I am just being lazy, and procrastinating. Thanks for listening.
