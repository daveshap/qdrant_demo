YORGI: And you. Why do you have such a problem staying away, my friend? Did you miss us that much?
XANDER: I wanted to get the hell out of Prague before Silent Night falls.
YORGI: Not bad, man, not bad. You put things together quick. Prague it is.
PETRA: The Peace conference...
YORGI: Nice place to start, don't you think?
XANDER: What's the gimmick, Yorgi? That's the part I don't get. You gonna hold the world hostage with your gas bombs? I didn't think you were dumb enough to go with that hack cliche.
YORGI: You think I'm after money? I told you, my friend. Anarchy. Time for a change. Money is good, but for true freedom you have to get rid of the rules themselves.
XANDER: So all by yourself, you're going to destroy every government; in the world.
YORGI: Easier than that, buddy. I'll get them to destroy each other. You kill an entire Peace conference, someone is going to have to pay. Then our friend Ahab continues down the river to the ocean and begins his world tour. London, Cairo, Beijing... Pretty soon everyone's involved. These guys bomb those guys, those guys invade these guys. Soon the whole world is like your wild West cowboy days. No rules, no law, everybody free to do what they want.
XANDER: Including rape, pillage, murder.
YORGI: Sure, if that's what you want. Why not? It's all human nature. So we just have to launch our baby and wait for the decline and fall of civilization as we know it.
XANDER: And here I thought anarchy" was just something cool to put on a Tshirt."
YORGI: Come on, Xander. You used to stand for something. What happened to you, man? I thought you'd get it.
PETRA: Don't you see, X? For the betterment of humanity, he's going to start World War Three.
XANDER: He's a regular humanitarian. And all this time I thought he was just a tool.
YORGI: You both could have been a part of it. You could have ridden with us into a new day, the dawning of a new age of --
XANDER: Oh just shoot us already. I'm sorry I asked.
