Dating is such a joke nowadays. Apologies for the rant! Not trying to discourage anyone but I take breaks from dating and it doesn't get any better trying again.
(28 M) here. There's nowhere to meet anyone. It's apparently unacceptable to ask someone at their work. Online dating is just for hookup fuckbois and girls for the most part (please don't be offended, just the people I have encountered on there). People just wanna be friends when you finally land the date or you get ghosted completely. 

I mean why bother!?! It's too far gone now. I have landed several jobs, cars ect. in the time it takes me to find one good person to date. I'm done dating for good now. It's a lot of work connecting with someone, it's time and patience I really don't have when it never works out. I would be willing if it worked out, but it never does. I absolutely love how family and friends don't know anyone single ever either. It's really easy for some people, and unbelievably frustrating for others. I'm not blaming other people, it's just not fun dating anymore.
