Did the rapid inflationary expansion slow down a lot because the inflaton field had decayed, or because of gravity from matter/radiation? What happened to the rate of expansion right after inflation ended?Did the rapid inflationary expansion slow down a lot because the inflaton field had decayed, or because gravity from matter/radiation gradually decelerated the rapid expansion? In other words, did inflationary expansion instantaneously turn into non-inflationary because inflaton field had decayed, or did inflationary expansion gradually decelerate to be non-inflationary because of gravity from matter/radiation?
