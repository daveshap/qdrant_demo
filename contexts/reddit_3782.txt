Craving intimate sex
I've been seeing a FWB for almost a year now and while I get along with her well and she is fun I have no real emotion towards her. I have explained this and she's fine with things being the way they are.

Every time we have sex it makes me feel that bit more lonely. I mean I do enjoy the sex and so does she but it really makes me miss that close intimate sex you can have with someone.

I do go on dates to meet other people but I've never found anyone I really like.

I'm 33 this year and sometimes you do wonder if this is going to be it. All my friends are in LTR, married and have kids. On the plus side it gives me a lot of time to focus on my goals and dreams but I really do wish I had someone to share my heart with
