I feel lost
From trying to help people on SuicideWatch I ended up being one of the ones that need help. How ironic, am I right?
It just feels so unfair...I, a person that never did anything right and never really clinged to life, gets to live while many, many good people have to die. I don't like it, that's unfair. I wish I could offer each of them a year of my existence. I want to see them enjoy the warm sunlight on their skin, pet a dog again, eat some ice cream.
Meanwhile I am here, feeling like my heart is being torn apart, like my body is always cold and frail and unable to cry even though I know I need to.
I feel so lost and lonely. I keep thinking about suicide and how many people I would disappoint by doing that...I just want to feel alive or offer my life to who really needs it.
