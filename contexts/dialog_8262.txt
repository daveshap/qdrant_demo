HANA: He's gone, hasn't he?
OLIVER: No. He's - no.
HANA: Oh God. Oh God.
CARAVAGGIO: Hana? Hana? Are you alright?
HANA: Don't touch me if you're going to try and fuck me.
CARAVAGGIO: I'll have some of your water. It's hot.
CARAVAGGIO: You have to protect yourself from sadness. This is the thing I've learned. You're in love with him, aren't you? Your patient. Do you think he's a saint or something? Because of the way he looks? I don't think he is.
HANA: I'm not in love with him. I'm in love with ghosts. And so is he. He's in love with ghosts.
CARAVAGGIO: Who are his ghosts?
HANA: Ask him.
CARAVAGGIO: What if I told you he did this to me?
HANA: What? How could he have? When?
CARAVAGGIO: I'm one of his ghosts and he wouldn't even know. It's like he slammed a door in Cairo and it trapped my fucking hands in Tobruk.
HANA: I don't know what that means.
CARAVAGGIO: Ask him. Ask your saint who he is. Ask him who he's killed.
HANA: Please don't creep around this house.
HANA: Tell me about this, this is in your handwriting - December 22nd - Betrayals in war are childlike compared with our betrayals during peace. New lovers are nervous and tender, but smash everything - for the heart is an organ of fire… I love that, I believe that. Who is K?
THE PATIENT: K is for Katharine.
ALMÁSY: Say you're sick.
KATHARINE: What? No!
ALMÁSY: Say you're feeling faint - the sun.
KATHARINE: No.
ALMÁSY: I can't work. I can't sleep. Lady Hampton calls impatiently.
LADY HAMPTON: Katharine!
KATHARINE: Coming. I can't sleep. I woke up shouting in the middle of the night. Geoffrey thinks it's the thing in the desert, the trauma.
ALMÁSY: I can still taste you.
KATHARINE: This is empty, just coming!
ALMÁSY: I'm trying to write with your taste in my mouth. Swoon. I'll catch you.
