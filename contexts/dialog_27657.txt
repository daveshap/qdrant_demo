MELANIE: Miss Hayworth?
ANNIE: Yes?
MELANIE: I'm Melanie Daniels. I'm sorry to bother you, but...
ANNIE: Yes?
MELANIE: The man at the post office sent me. He said you'd know the name of the little Brenner girl.
ANNIE: Cathy?
MELANIE: The one who lives in the white house across the bay?
ANNIE: That's the one. Cathy Brenner.
MELANIE: They seemed sure it was either Alice or Lois.
ANNIE: Which is why the mail in this town never gets delivered to the right place. Did you want to see Cathy about something?
