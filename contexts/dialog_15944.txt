LEON: Good! First shot!
MATHILDA: Yeah, but I didn't get him, I got his case and now he's behind the tree. What can I do?
LEON: It's not serious, it's just training. You have to learn from the beginning to hit the target, then, to improve precision, you'll train, but on cardboards.
MATHILDA: OK.
LEON: Now, try a running guy.
MATHILDA: The yellow and pink.
LEON: OK.
