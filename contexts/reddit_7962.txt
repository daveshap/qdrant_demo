ROI of a Business Analytics Masters in Europe?
I want to do a M. Sc. in Business Analytics (data analysis, forecasting, database maagement, etc.) in Europe, but I don't know how which university to choose, given that some seem really good, last for 1 year (e.g. Vrije Universitat Amsterdam) and are very cheap (2k Euros), but others are top schools (e.g. ESADE) and charge 30k+ Euros for 2 years.

I've seen videos and articles where people sort of rank universities in the US based on ROI. That is, it isn't really worth it, on average, to go to Harvard, given that you would not earn much more than a Boston University graduate, for example.

How can I evaluate the ROI for universities in Europe, given that there are so many prestigious ones and which vary so much in price?
