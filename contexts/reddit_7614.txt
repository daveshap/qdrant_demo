Industry internship might conflict with advisor's company
I have a weirdly specific question that I'm hoping to get some advice or insight into. I'm working with my advisor at the moment on developing therapeutics in a pretty small field. My advisor started a company last year that is still very new, and when I joined the lab he told me in no uncertain terms that I could contribute to its growth if I wanted to (that was part of the reason I joined in the first place).

Ultimately, I am interested in joining industry after graduation and my PhD program offers a pretty cool industry internship program that I can participate in during any part of my thesis work (with sufficient permission from my advisor). When I joined his lab, I told him that I would really want to participate in this program towards the end of my PhD and he was very supportive of this.

So here is my dilemma. Should I do an internship with a company that has direct conflicts with my advisor's company (especially if it has a lot of big shots in the field, a great working environment, and several opportunities to engage in the topics I am interested in)? Or should I find an internship in another field that might still develop the same skills/provide a similar network? I'm not super tied to this field so I'd be willing to change if necessary but I also feel like my skill set and experience would be best utilized in the field I am already in.

I don't want to do an "internship" at my advisor's company because it is so new and while I am definitely gaining a lot of knowledge and insight watching him grow the company, I think working at an established company would give me the career insight I am currently lacking.
