CARETAKER: No pictures. No mirrors. Was she a crazy woman when you knew her?
BRENT: No.
CARETAKER: Couldn't tell she going to off herself, huh?
BRENT: No, you couldn't.
CARETAKER: I've been in a lot of people's houses and this one's the creepiest.

BRENT: Why?
CARETAKER: People always keep their secrets in their attics or in their basements. All the weirdness in this house took place in the basement.
