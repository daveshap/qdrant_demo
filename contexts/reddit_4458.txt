Rules & Guidelines
**No toxic behaviour** \- Misogyny, misandry, racism, religious intolerance, harassment, racism, homophobia, offensive, abusive, rude or argumentative behaviour will not be tolerated. Respect one another, even those you disagree with. If you have a problem, report it instead of replying with something just as bad.

**If you are not subscribed to the Subreddit, you should not be downvoting posts, especially for no reason.**

**Do not spam or post anything irrelevant.**

**Low effort, false, inaccurate, and inappropriate advice/content will be removed.**

**Nothing about personal messaging each other** \- Don't ask or tell anyone to PM, DM, or inbox you.

**Nothing illegal** \- If it's illegal, don't post it.

**No threadjacking or comment qualifiers** \- Stay focused on the OP's message.

**No soliciting funds** \- You may not solicit money from this subreddit. Please view any effort to solicit money in here as a scam. Any need for donations can go to [/r/assistance](https://www.reddit.com/r/assistance) or [/r/care](https://www.reddit.com/r/care).

**No advertising** \- Do not link another subreddit, a YouTube channel, a personal website, clickbait, stuff for sale, other or other social media platforms. Subreddits, articles and other content may be linked for reference when providing support or advice.

**No confidential content** \- Do not share a picture of anyone's face, genitals, phone number, email address, postal address, or any other personal identifying information.

**Safe for Work** \- Severe NSFW content will not be accepted and slight NSFW content should be marked appropriately.
