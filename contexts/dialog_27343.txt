MACKENZIE: It's gonna be sticky.
STARKS: Why?
MACKENZIE: 'Cause Lorenson's got her claws in it now. When she started getting suspicious about me was when they stopped using it on me. Women!
STARKS: So what am I supposed to do?
MACKENZIE: You could still always give Becker an itch. 'Course you might get killed when he goes to scratch it, but seems to me you're saying that's about to happen anyway. [Beat] Just be careful not to walk yourself right into something.
DR. GRIES: We're late.
LORENSON: I wish they'd skip the formality of this annual review and just cut our budget. Our silence on the matter should be enough to appease the civic conscience without wasting an hour we don't have.
DR. GRIES: Maybe it's not such a waste.
LORENSON: It's the ticking of a box on a sheet of paper no one cares about.
DR. GRIES: They don't care about all the things we do right. [Beat] But they might ...they might care about what we're doing wrong. [Beat] That's what they should come here to look for.
LORENSON: What should they be looking for?
DR. GRIES: They should just be looking harder.
LORENSON: Where? [Beat] It's Becker isn't it? He's doing stuff, isn't he?
DR. GRIES: Later. I'll tell you about it later. We got a session to catch now.
