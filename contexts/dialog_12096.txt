VERGER: Thank you, Cordell.
LECHTER: ...but will that satisfy you?
VERGER: Why should <u>you</u> care?
LECHTER: It is not that I care for <u>you</u>--but that I posses an enquiring mind. What will you <u>do</u> when I am gone? When you have nothing to occupy your thoughts, save the memory of your own folly, and, more to the point, stupidity.
VERGER: ARE YOU <u>DONE</u>?
LECHTER: <u>Yes</u>.
VERGER: You don't wish to <u>beg</u>...?
LECHTER: Would that add to your <u>mirth</u>?
VERGER: Explain in depth the plan we have for him. Until tomorrow.
