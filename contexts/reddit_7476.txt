I can’t do it.
I’m in the process of writing my proposal. For the past 3 months I have been struggling with it to a point that I am thinking of dropping out but I’m almost done with all my classes and internships so dropping out just doesn’t feel right. However, I know I can only graduate when I submit my thesis. 
I have never struggled this hard to write a paper, in fact I have written a dissertation for my masters which also got published in an international journal. The process then felt like a cake walk. Now I’m struggling so hard with academic writing, with the political sensitivity of the topic, and now this whole pandemic. I feel stuck mentally and spiritually. But then again there is this inner belief that tells me I can do it. I don’t know how get out of this rut and start my creative process again. I am thinking of psychedelics to expand my creative process. Please help
