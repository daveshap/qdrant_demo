Do people think cubicles are soundproof???
Question might be confusing, but basically I work in a typical office environment. Cubicles in the middle of a large square room, offices on the outside. My team occupies roughly 1/3 of the offices and cubicles. There is one cubicle the team often gathers around intermittently for group/work conversation, and often times it devolves into discussions about other people in the workplace not on our team. Some of these people are literally sitting in the next cubicle over. Some of them might be team members of someone in a cubicle. Some of them might be in an office with the door open across the room...

It gets super awkward standing there when someone is getting trash talked and they or their friends can obviously hear it. I want in no way to be associated with it so I just slowly pull out my phone and back away... but god damn no wonder our team struggles to get along with the other departments. Workplace bullshit like that is absurd, and itâ€™s especially frustrating when bosses who should be bridging gaps just jump on the train as well
