High power highpass filter I'm using an audio amplifier to produce a 15-20 kHz, 6 watt sine wave output into a pure resistive load.  There are some low-frequency components to this signal that I want to remove (mains frequency harmonics).  How is this best achieved?  I know how to construct RC filters for signal (i.e. low) voltage circuits but not power circuits.  Can someone give an answer about how I should design the filter and suggest components that may work?
