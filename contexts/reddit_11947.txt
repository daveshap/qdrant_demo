Kidney Stones Are Ruining My life!
Hey guys,

I'm not really expecting any help but just want to vent it out. I have been having an issue with kidney stones since the past six years or so. I am aged 26 and I can attribute the formation of kidney stones to heriditory factors mostly. Ofcourse, my diet and not drinking enough water has contributed to it too. 

So, I am currently having 11 kidney stones the maximum of which is 9mm. Every time I pass a kidney stone, it sucks the life out of me and I want to kill myself. I am other wise a happy guy but every painful episode makes me really depressed.

Each time a painful episode occurs, Im put in the hospital and supportive treatment is provided till I pass the stone. Usually it takes a couple of days but I become sick and weak for few days after that. I lose 2-4 kgs in this time. I get an episode every 6 months to one year.

I have increased my water intake for the past 8- 10 months but the stones have only increased. The type of kidney stones I form are of the calcium oxalate type.

I am going to try lemon juice therapy for now. Some guy on you tube suggests drinking concentrated lemon juice of one glass weekly once. Citrate is known for its action against kidney stones.So, Im gonna try that and hope for the best. I have tried numerous alternative medicine stuff before without much luck.

Other factors Im trying to control
-Drinking enough water
-Reducing Protein in my diet
-Have to reduce sodium too.

If anybody can offer me some advice or help, I would really appreciate it.
