I want to thank this sub for inspiring me to do better. This sub has saved my ass many many times over.
I [24F] got my first “big girl job” and have been working almost a year and never saved a penny. I blew through $400 a week because i still live with my mom and though i pay all of my bills (car note, car insurance, phone, etc) she pick up the slack where my “rent and utilities” would come into play. 

I started following this sub when i first heard about it and skimmed occasionally. Then one day i saw a comment. OP said (and im paraphrasing) it doesn’t matter how much you save as long as you save. If all you have this week to contribute is 1$. Then add that dollar. So i said okay okay okay, i went down to the local bank, and opened a savings account and threw the required $25 opening requirement in and never thought about it again. 

So a week goes by and I go to cash my check. And the teller informs me that I had a minus but it was covered by the money in my savings. How much did I over draft by? $24.00 EXACTLY to the cent.  

I never even caught the fucking charge! I never saw it because i never checked my statements. I would have been sitting on an over draft fee of $45. 

It was at that moment that *i got it*. I realized money is no joke, swiping my card loosely without regard or respect is a dangerous game that i don’t want to play. 

That was on October 22nd, 2018. As off this morning December 1st. i have $625 in my savings. I know i’m not rich lol but it’s more money than i’ve ever had before at one time, and i couldn’t be prouder of my self that i committed to something this serious for this long. 

Thank you all for everything.
