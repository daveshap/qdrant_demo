ELLEN: Why don't you take a half day and clean this junk up?
BRODY: Because, I'm in the middle of a boating accident, I got only four regular cops and one secretary, and a Chief Deputy who is constantly fiddling with the police boat He's another one.
ELLEN: One what? Ah-ha!
BRODY: Boat nut. What is it about this place that makes everyone a freak for boating?
ELLEN: It's an island. Got to run.
MIKE: I'm going.
BRODY: What about tennis? Riding? fixing up old cars? Bartending?
MIKE: Bartending? I'm 17.
BRODY: Okay, not bartending. Why on the water every day?
MIKE: Because.
BRODY: Look, humor the old man -- just be careful.
MIKE: I'll be careful. I'll see y'later.
BRODY: Don't go out if it's rough or any- thing, huh? We've had a lot of trouble.
MIKE: Okay, okay.
SEAN: Can I go with you today?
BRODY: You stay with Mrs. Silvera, Tootsie. Okay?
