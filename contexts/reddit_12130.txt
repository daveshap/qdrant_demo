The girl I have been seeing told me we need to stop talking because she needs time... and the thing that hurts me is that I will not be able to see her cat anymore if everything falls apart
She has this fat ass cat that lives in her family house. I met her twice and thought she was super adorable. She’s a character, she’s sweet and she rocks. The girl I’ve been hanging out with (her owner) is als sweet and cool but she told me yesterday that she needs time and that we can’t talk that often anymore for multiple reasons. I don’t know if it’s weird to say that I will miss seeing her cat. She’s just so adorable she warms my heart. 

The only thing I have left is a collection of pics I got of her cat. She sent me those long time ago and everytime I see ‘em it makes my day (is it weird I have a bunch of pics of her cat? I don’t care if you say yes).

:(
