[META] Welcome to our new 5,000 subscribers and New FAQ
Hello Neutrons-

Over the last few days we have taken in around 5,000 subscribers.  As we usually do when we gain a lot of new subscribers we wanted to take the time to post about our rules.  We also decided to update our FAQ so I will use this opportunity to do two things.  Post our new FAQ and welcome our new subscribers.  We are now at 132,000+ neutrons.  

Thank you all!

**Is this a subreddit for people who are politically neutral?**

No - in fact we welcome and encourage any viewpoint to engage in discussion. The idea behind r/NeutralPolitics is to set up a neutral space where those of differing opinions can come together and rationally lay our respective arguments. We are neutral in that no political opinion is favored here - only facts and logic. Your post or comment will be judged not by its perspective, but by its style, rationale, and informational content.

At this subreddit, we want to allow people who disagree on something to work it out between themselves in the interest of mutual understanding. If understanding truly cannot be reached (which is sometimes the case), we recommend that the conversation only continue as long both sides maintain decorum and feel that they are benefiting from the interaction. The mods will allow you to debate as long as it is civil, but sometimes it is best to part ways with a respectful “Good day, sir”. The choice lies in your good judgment.

Finally, try your best in a conversation to understand the other person’s perspective and determine rationally whether it makes sense. Take time to consider what they are saying. **Do not read a reply with the assumption that the other person is wrong**. Look for points that make sense and acknowledge them. Look for points that you can disprove and lay out your counterargument and evidence. Through this attitude, your discussion can be constructive and informative for both parties involved.

**So you’re personally not politically neutral? Well…can I still make Futurama jokes?**

I have no strong feelings one way or the other.

-----

**Are world events allowed, or is r/NeutralPolitics region specific?**

Our subreddit has a global scope, and the politics of any region is equally valued for conversation. Keep in mind, though, that if not many other redditors are located in the region that you are posting about, we won’t necessarily understand your topic. If that’s the case, make sure to post informative links so that we could all get a chance to learn more and then discuss it. 

-----

**I want to post a news article that I saw on a larger subreddit. Is that okay?**

Conversations on the larger political subreddits can often be disappointing, so it is perfectly acceptable to repost a news article here. In fact, it is encouraged! The goal is for r/NeutralPolitics to be a legitimate alternative to other political discussion subreddits, and that means that we need more than just discussion - we need current events, too. Just remember two things: use a different source for the story if the linked content is heavily biased or overly emotional and avoid copying the post title unless you have verified that it meets our standards.  Also we ask that you remove the references to the other subreddit, we don't really need a meta discussion about the other sub in question.

**There sure is a lot of weight placed on evidence and information here. Why is that?**

When discussing practical political issues, it is easy to get involved in emotional arguments and assumptions. By emphasizing that your argument is only as good as the data and/or logic that supports it, we remove the emotional element that leads to bickering and flame wars. It is much easier to argue information than it is to argue feelings, and we walk away from the former not angry, but with a better understanding of the world around us. **The goal here isn’t to prove that you are right.** It is to find out if you are right. This doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t defend your position, but it does mean that you should acknowledge when you have been presented with enough logical evidence to bring that position into question.

**What kind of evidence should I use?**

We also have created a [guide to help](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/5qe3vg/a_resource_guide_for_building_your_factbased/).

-----

**What types of posts should I report?**

Most people associate the report button with someone breaking a rule. However, at r/NeutralPolitics we encourage that you report a post if there is any reason at all that a moderator should look at it. We won’t be able to necessarily catch everything, so we need your help to keep the standards of discussion for the community high. In addition to anything that breaks the /r/NeutralPoilitics & Reddit wide rules, report a post if it:

* Contains memes, spam, or is otherwise devoid of meaningful content
* Insults another user or says something that makes a hostile environment for discussion
* Doesn’t break any rules, but could use some constructive input 
* Cites a source that you think should be saved for posterity in the r/NeutralPolitics archive

Please don't report the following:

* You feel the comment isn't Neutral, note this isn't a requirement as long as the comment has sources for facts presented
* You feel the sources are biased, the answer to this is to respond with better sources, or with sources showing why that source can't be trusted. [Here is a good example](https://np.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/comments/5uv7ov/what_are_the_pros_and_cons_of_the_us_building_a/ddy0lt1/)

-----

**I’m an expert in a field relevant to this community, such as political science, economics, or statistics. Can I get flair?**

We don't give flair because we find it places an undue emphasis on the 'expert'.  It should be easier for any expert on a subject to find relevant sources and link or reference them.  

-----

**What do I do if I have a problem with a moderator?**

If a moderator is behaving inappropriately, [contact the mod team at large](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FNeutralPolitics) privately with your concerns and one of us/all of us will be happy to discuss it with you.

**Surveys/Questions on Demographics/Breakdown by Party Affiliation**

We sometimes get requests to present data on the demographics of this sub, or someone saying they can't accurately gauge the ideas presented without some sort of demographic breakdown.  We do not do surveys, they are explicitly disallowed by our guidelines.  Again the qualifications for a good comment/post are: *"We are neutral in that no political opinion is favored here - only facts and logic. Your post or comment will be judged not by its perspective, but by its style, rationale, and informational content."*
