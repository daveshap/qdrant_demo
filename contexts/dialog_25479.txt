PICARD: Onscreen.
PICARD: Admiral... what's the status of the Borg fleet?
ADMIRAL HAYES: It's been destroyed. The Borg threat is over. Are you all right? The Enterprise disappeared from our sensors for a moment.
PICARD: We're fine, sir. It will take some... time to explain.
ADMIRAL HAYES: I look forward to reading your report.
