CLARENCE'S VOICE: What did you stop it for?
JOSEPH'S VOICE: I want you to take a good look at that face.
CLARENCE'S VOICE: Who is it?
JOSEPH'S VOICE: George Bailey.
CLARENCE'S VOICE: Oh, you mean the kid that had his ears slapped back by the druggist.
JOSEPH'S VOICE: That's the kid.
CLARENCE'S VOICE: It's a good face. I like it. I like George Bailey. Tell me, did he ever tell anyone about the pills?
JOSEPH'S VOICE: Not a soul.
CLARENCE'S VOICE: Did he ever marry the girl? Did he ever go exploring?
JOSEPH'S VOICE: Well, wait and see.
GEORGE: Big –– see! I don't want one for one night. I want something for a thousand and one nights, with plenty of room for labels from Italy and Baghdad, Samarkand . . . a great big one.
JOE: I see, a flying carpet, huh? I don't suppose you'd like this old second-hand job, would you?
GEORGE: Now you're talkin'. Gee whiz, I could use this as a raft in case the boat sunk. How much does this cost?
JOE: No charge.
GEORGE: That's my trick ear, Joe. It sounded as if you said no charge.
