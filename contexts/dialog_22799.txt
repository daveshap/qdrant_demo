ESPERANZA: Ramón were not getting weaker. We're stronger than ever before. They're getting weaker. They thought they could break our picket line. And they failed. And now they can't win unless they pull off something big, and pull it off fast.
RAMÓN: Like what?
ESPERANZA: I don't know. But I can feel it coming. It's like ... like a lull before the storm. Charley Vidal says ...
RAMÓN: Charley Vidal says! Don't throw Charley Vidal up to me!
ESPERANZA: Charley's my friend. I need friends. Why are you afraid to have me as your friend?
RAMÓN: I don't know what you're talking about.
ESPERANZA: No, you don't. Have you learned nothing from this strike? Why are you afraid to have me at your side? Do you still think you can have dignity only if I have none?
RAMÓN: You talk of dignity? After what you've been doing?
ESPERANZA: Yes. I talk of dignity. The Anglo bosses look down on you, and you hate them for it. Stay in your place
RAMÓN: Shut up, you're talking crazy.
ESPERANZA: Whose neck shall I stand on, to make me feel superior? And what will I get out of it? I don't want anything lower than I am. I'm low enough already. I want to rise. And push everything up with me as I go ...
RAMÓN: Will you be still?
ESPERANZA: And if you can't understand this you're a fool -- because you can't win this strike without me! You can't win anything without me!
