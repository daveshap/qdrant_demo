Anyone else hate CBT?
I can't stand it. I can't stand having "homework" to do. I can't stand having to do worksheets.

I hate mindfulness. I hate it all.

It makes me feel like I'm being treated like a child. But there doesn't seem to be anything else. 

I see a therapist and we talk. But I can't get help online or anywhere else between sessions because they're all worksheets and brain exercises and mindfulness. I hate it all so much. Even when I'm not depressed I can't stand it.

Anyone else the same? What else do you do?
