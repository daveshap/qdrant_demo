Sexually harassed, no one seems to care.
I am a man in my 20's working in a factory floor environment currently for two and a half years. A few years ago I had issues with a supervisor and had to go to HR. Several other coworkers were having issues with him as well at the time. Back then they said they would keep my complaints confidential, but they clearly did not because my supervisor was upset with me for going to HR. He knew everything I discussed with them. This made me extremely uncomfortable.

Right now I am having issues with a female coworker who's older and works in my area. I should have went to HR sooner, but didn't because of what happened the last time. HR isn't your friend in my opinion. The coworker I am having issues with has made unwanted sexual comments to me and has made comments about me to my significant other. I told this coworker to leave me alone. My significant other messaged her on social media, not being being rude or violent, asking why she was making me feel uncomfortable. She made sexual comments about me through those messages and told my SO to come to our workplace to tell her something in person to "hurt her feelings." She told my SO she didn't have the balls to meet her in the parking lot in person. My SO has lunch with me sometimes and sees her there anyways so she decided to just show up like she asked. My SO made it clear she didn't want to get into a physical altercation and was willing to hear what she had to say. My coworker waved her down, my SO approached her immediately telling her she did not want to fight, but was willing to hear what she had to say. My coworker immediately started making sexual comments about me to my SO while I was standing right there. I made it clear that I didn't like what she was saying about me and that I was uncomfortable. She then refused to tell my SO what she invited her to come hear. Then my coworker ran to her car and called our supervisor. They asked my SO to leave and she did. My SO was angry as anyone would be, but wasn't threatening her and made it clear that she didn't want to fight. She's at my workplace all the time to have lunch with me and she goes to company events. We were separately called to HR and I explained that I wanted nothing to do with this coworker after she has sexually harassed me. I asked my SO for screenshots of their messages, and showed HR.

The next week, other coworkers had heard/seen her yelling at my SO in the parking lot and asked her about what happened. She told other coworkers that we both deserve to die and that we should kill ourselves. She told the other coworkers that she wanted my SO to show up so she could try to convince her and tell her why she should kill herself/we should kill ourselves (but she didn't and ran to her car instead). I was then pulled into HR again that evening. I made it clear to my HR department that I wanted nothing to do with this person and refuse to even work with them. How am I supposed to work with someone who makes unwanted sexual comments about me and wants me and the woman I love to die and thinks we deserve to die? I'm willing to quit my job if I have to work with that person again, and I have informed my HR the same (I am getting training in a different department currently until sometime in September). They pretty much just told me that I don't have to interact with this person and that they hope I don't have to quit. They said they "handled it" and that I don't have to interact or speak with this coworker, but they are still making me work next to her in September. Doesn't that count as interaction? We would be standing next to or across from the other. They still expect me to continue to work next to this person once my training is over and I simply refuse. I just don't think any of this should be tolerated, and they seem to not actually be doing anything about it. To be honest, personally I do think she should be fired because I don't think this should be tolerated at all, but I would feel so much better if I could just move to a different part of the factory, I don't really have that option unless someone else quits.

Maybe to some this might seem extreme, but I don't feel safe around this person at all and I refuse to be anywhere near them. Now at work I skip out on meetings (with permission for the time being) because she will be there, and I have to avoid walking through that area of the factory. I have to park on the other side of the building to avoid her. I have to tip toe around this person that did things that I didn't deserve. I messed up by not going to HR faster, but why should I be the one making all of the accommodations? Why is this being tolerated? I feel like if the genders were reversed, this would have been handled much differently. I feel like they aren't taking my concerns or feelings seriously because I'm a man. I don't think anyone male or female should have to deal with this at work, or anywhere for that matter. It's awful. If nothing happens on my end, I want to at least do something about this to possibly make it easier for the next person who's in this situation.

I have found the head HR representative of the corporation I work for and the head of compliance. I'm considering writing an email to someone, but I'm not exactly sure how to go about writing the email or who would be best to contact. I'm worried I won't be taken seriously. My options seem to be to email the head HR representative and possibly have good results (by not having to work next to this person somehow), get lucky and hope a job opens up in a different department before my training is up, or unfortunately quit my job. Is there anyone else I should contact instead? How can I make this easier for the next person in this type of situation? If anyone has any tips or guidance on this matter it would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.

\*\*TL;DR\*\* A female coworker has sexually harassed me and told others she wants me dead. HR wants me to continue to work next to her. I can't feel safe working next to someone who's harassed me and wants me and my SO dead. Is there anything I can do to convince someone to help me so I can keep my job there?
