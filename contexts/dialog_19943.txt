ROY: Hey, Betty. Are you okay?
BETTY: I'm great, good, content. What happened to your arm, Roy?
ROY: Oh, nothing, it's fine. I just need to keep it wrapped for a few...
BETTY: Make sure it's elevated...
ROY: Uh-huh.
BETTY: You want me to make you a sling? It's no problem...
BETTY: What're you doing here, Roy?
ROY: Well, I was worried about you and I wanted to make sure you were alright... and I guess I was sort of hoping I could ask you about what happened...
BETTY: Oh, that... Sure, I saw the whole thing. It was disgusting!
ROY: My God... did you get a look at who did it?
BETTY: Yes.
ROY: You did? Was it anyone that you...?
BETTY: It was Chloe...
