MAN: Yes.
DR. HOFFMAN: I'm Dr. Hoffman, Medical Administrator.
MAN: Has he been prepped?
DR. HOFFMAN: Ready to go. Who signs for him?
MAN: I do.
DR. HOFFMAN: Outside.
MAN: Check him out.
MAN: I'd assumed Dr. Loomis would be here. Michael Myers was his patient.
DR. HOFFMAN: If Loomis read memos he's be here. Fortunately his position is more ceremonial then medical. My hope is that he's either transfer, retire, or die.
