JIMMIE: Gee, I wouldn't appoint an old twerp like Horace Miller--Taylor or no Taylor!
HUBERT: Taylor! May I ask what *Taylor* has to do with it?
JIMMIE: Well, he's still running the show, ain't he, Dad?
HUBERT: Emma! I will not have conversations of this sort carried on by the children at dinner!
EMMA: Nonsense. Why don't you listen to your children for a change? You might actually learn something?
HUBERT: For instance, how to run the affairs of government? No doubt my children could make this appointment *for* me-- with the greatest ease!
JIMMIE: That's easy. Jefferson Smith.
HUBERT: I beg your pardon?
