Do you feel like COVID-19 is going to change the workforce permanently?
I feel like COVID could change the workforce for the better.

Instead of having to be glued to an office chair 5 days a week, I really feel like office jobs will convert to a WFH type of environment. On the off chance that you still do need to go to an office, I feel like the days you are required to be on-site will be reduced.

I also feel like the e-commerce business will be the way to go as people aren't going to want to really deal in hand to hand exchanges. Just my opinion.

What type of changes do you feel COVID-19 will bring about to work environment?
