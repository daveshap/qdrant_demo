ROSS: Every oil tanker and super- tanker and super-duper-tanker in the ocean is controlled. totally, by computers. Computers to tell them where to go, how much oil to take on, where to deliver it.
GUS: They ain't got captains?
ROSS: Yes, but they don't really need them. it's just a throw- back to some sentimental sea- faring baloney.
VERA: You will command the tankers to sail toward a 50-mile area in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean.
GUS: And do what?
ROSS: And do nothing. Just sit there.
GUS: Then how's all the people gonna get their oil?
ROSS: You catch on fast, old buddy. Tell him about the pumps. I know how you love the part about the pumps.
