How do you carefully explain to recruiters that you needed to take a break after your last job without creating any suspicions about your character and capability?
I don’t plan on telling future recruiters how terrible my past job was even if there is a chance they might have heard about it (yes, the company is that notorious). I know enough to never bring that topic up in interviews and to just leave it all behind the past. But how do I carefully explain that I needed to take a break and a possible two month gap of unemployment? 

The truth is, my job burned me out and was becoming unhealthy for me physically and emotionally. Almost every day I have to worry about colleagues that might try to sabotage me, I work with people that do not care about properly guiding you through a process you aren’t familiar with and I’m constantly bothered with the realization that this job wasn’t for me in the first place. I stuck around just long enough to have my evaluation, which was fortunately positive and then decided I have done enough. 

I might have depression, I’m seeing a professional for this and for any possible treatment. I don’t want to bring any of this baggage to my next job so I’m doing everything I can to become healthy again. 

How are you supposed to spend your break when you’re trying to heal from extreme burn out and sudden loss of confidence? And what other way is there to carefully explain to future employers that you needed a break without sounding like someone who couldn’t handle the pressures of corporate life?
