PHILIP: Your friend Overman picked a hell of a time to come back.
MIKE: Yeah, poor bastard.
PHILIP: I lost a good cameraman in Australia last year. A Great White chopped him in half with one bite.
MIKE: Hey, I don't want to hear.
PHILIP: That's how they do it, you know. Seizes its prey and shakes its body savagely. Teeth gnaw through a man like a buzz saw.
MIKE: Buzz off.
PHILIP: I will, old boy, tomorrow. Our work is done here. Just came to say goodbye, and good luck.
MIKE: Yeah? Well, in that case, have a drink.
PHILIP: Thanks. Bullshot.
MIKE: So where you go off to, Hutton? Some expedition in New Guinea or Outer Mongolia?
PHILIP: No, South Georgia.
MIKE: What the hell's there?
PHILIP: Polar bears.
MIKE: Polar bears in Georgia???
PHILIP: South Georgia, Antarctica.
MIKE: Oh...
PHILIP: The world's southern most reaches.
MIKE: How come you're so brave with all this stuff?
PHILIP: Tradition. Royal sense of adventure that's been in my family for centuries. Dates back to the Crusades and King Richard. What I was born to do.
MIKE: Yeah, tradition's a bitch, ain't it?
PHILIP: Reach for the limit I always say.
MIKE: I'll remember that, my Lordship.
