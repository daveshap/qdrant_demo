How can i \"spy\" on my second dual monitor output from the main screen? I have a dual monitor setup, but have no way to view the second monitor screen, unless i leave and go into a different area of the building, how can i view the contents of the second monitor output on my main primary screen?Ideally i would like a live desktop background of my second monitor always playing as the default desktop image, but I could see using an app like VNC, VLC, but i presume this would put alot of overhead on my already busy CPU. Is there a more direct tap method, i.e. something i can just route the actual raw monitor feed to a tandem/slave viewer?Thanks!
