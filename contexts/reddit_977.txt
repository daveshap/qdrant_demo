Had anxiety for years and I finally plucked up enough courage to apply for a job and I got it, I am now building up money to move to London, fuck anxiety and depression will NOT take my life
Been in a bad way the past couple of years, stuck in a rut with no light at the end of the tunnel. There’s been many times I  contemplated suicide.

The other day I just thought fuck it I’m making something of myself, so step 1 of that was contributing to society (get a job), step 2 is to move to a better area somewhere I can feel more happy and fulfilled.

Still not out of the woods yet but I’m trying given the terrible circumstances.

Of course I am anxious and scared still of the uncertainty, I hear the horrible voice saying ‘everything will fail’ ‘nothing will work out for you’

London will be a fresh start for me, whilst I’m at it I might even change my name and identity lol
