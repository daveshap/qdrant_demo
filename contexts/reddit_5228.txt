asking for time off?
idk if this is the right subreddit or if i used the right flair but here goes. i work in fast food and just found out today about a trip i was invited on. it’s for this sunday-next saturday. i’m supposed to work sunday, the schedule for next week isn’t released yet. i also am going to need time off in a month (a week long road trip) should i/how do i ask for sunday and next week off?
