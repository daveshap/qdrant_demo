LETTY: I can't believe you finally gave me the shirt.
RUTH: Loaned you. And it's only 'til you get out of here.
LETTY: That settles it. I'm never leaving.
RUTH: I can hardly wait 'til you're free. Planning the wedding without you has been a disaster.
LETTY: You're slowing.
RUTH: Mom and I fought for 20 minutes over whether we should go with ecru invitations or brilliant white.
RUTH: What do you think?
LETTY: Ecru.
RUTH: And then the gold scroll or the black Romanesque print?
LETTY: Do we have to talk wedding details?
RUTH: Oh, no, of course not.
