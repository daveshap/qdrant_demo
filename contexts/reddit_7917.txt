How can I become a better researcher?
Im in my second semester of graduate school in my pursuit of attaining a Master's degree in Pharmacology. I spent the first semester doing ELISA and Western Blot training and learning theory and background of those techniques. This semester part of me wants to pursue my own project within our lab (we are characterizing a monoclonal antibody) and part of me is too scared that I will mess up and make a fool of myself.

&#x200B;

What scares me and I need help with is the fact that there is sooooo much knowledge out there that its daunting almost. I still don't understand the technique intracies like why some solvents or solutions are used and what their purpose is and I feel like my PI will look poorly on me if I ask him. How can I become more comfortable in my field of research (Pharmacology) so I can ask the proper questions when doing research? How does one become knowledgeable in their field and ready to design their own experiments?
