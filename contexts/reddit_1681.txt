BREAKING NEWS: Northeastern University decides to just not do decisions this year
In a truly unprecedented move, Northeastern University has decided to not bother finishing to read their remaining Regular Decision applications and revoke admission from all those accepted in the early rounds.

"We deeply regret to inform all our potential applicants that we will no longer be able to send them short, impersonal letters this year." noted Assistant Dean of Admissions Stefanie Kane. "It was lots of fun sending them confusing and vague emails about our decision date, though. The funniest part? We weren't releasing decisions in the first place this year!" Kane also scoffed at the idea of institutional oversight and transparency. "We only hope our decisions release process is as nonsensical and sporadic as the University of Michigan's. The website crash in January simply wasn't enough." 

Experts suggest that the move may have been an effort by Northeastern to manage their yield and US News ranking. "If you don't accept anyone, your yield rate automatically rises to 100%." noted many high school seniors disguised as college admissions experts. Additionally, Northeastern's ranking is projected to rise significantly next year, making it competitive with similarly named institutions such as Northwestern, the South Eastern Conference, and Southwestern Missouri Community College. 

Many A2C members were at first inconsolable, but soon realized that they didn't want to "fuckin attend a school named after a direction anyways" and it was all "yield protection".

EDIT: Thanks for the awards!
