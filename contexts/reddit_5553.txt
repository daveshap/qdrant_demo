Apple college student Support strictly for college students only?
I'm trying to apply for a job and I really would like to get a job doing apple support because it's a work from home position and isn't physical because I really need a job that is more of sitting down (I'm trying to get into UI design) but I've seen the Apple call support position but it looks like it's for college students only? I just recently graduated from college so does that mean I'm out of luck? Are they really strict about only hiring college students for this position or can it be recent graduates too?
