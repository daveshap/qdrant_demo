PETER: What'd he say?
REGGIE: He -- he said if I didn't give the money, he'll kill me.
PETER: I wouldn't take that too seriously.
REGGIE: I believe what he said.
PETER: They're only trying to scare you, that's all.
REGGIE: How do you know what they're doing?
PETER: I don't -- but as long as they think you have the money, or know where it is, or have it without knowing where it is, or don't even know you have it --
REGGIE: What are you talking about?
PETER: You mustn't let what he said bother you. It was only words.
REGGIE: Words can hurt very much.
PETER: Go to sleep -- I'll see you in the morning.
REGGIE: Don't put yourself out.
PETER: Hey -- I'm on your side. Remember that.
REGGIE: Yes, I'll remember. Good night.
PETER: Good night.
