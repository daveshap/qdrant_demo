ADAM: Aren't you scared?
LYDIA: I'm not scared of Ralph Lauren. Those are <u>sheets</u>. Are you gross under there? Are you <u>Night of the</u> <u>Living Dead</u> under there? Like all bloody veins and pus?
ADAM: What?
LYDIA: <u>Night of the Living Dead</u>? It's this gross movie.
BARBARA: If I had seen a ghost at your age, I would have been frightened out of my wits.
LYDIA: You're not gross. Why were you wearing a sheet?
BARBARA: We're practicing.
ADAM: You can actually see us? Without the sheets?
LYDIA: Is this like a trick question?
BARBARA: Tell the truth.
LYDIA: I always tell the truth. Of course I can see you.
ADAM: Nobody else can.
LYDIA: I'm wearing contacts... Also I read through <u>Handbook for the</u> <u>Recently Deceased</u>. It says that live people ignore the strange and unusual... not me... <u>I am</u> strange and unusual.
