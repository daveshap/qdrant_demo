How to make female breast armor viable? It is known that armor with accentuated design for breast is a bad choice in an actual confrontation. What can be changed to make \"breast armor\" more effective? Like materials(fictional or not), design(without changing the \"breast room\" completely).My character lives in a medieval world, and is a female knight, she is looking for marriage and is trying to look more attractive for potential candidates without losing too much protection.EDIT:Thanks for all the answers, they helped a lot, first let me clarify some things, the objective of the question is not to create a sexist character to appeal for male fantasia, I am trying to avoid it, changing the character to meet the beauty criteria of the time is not a good idea, she is looking for in the world \u00e9l\u00e9ments to make herself more appealing, putting breast on armor might not be effective form of male attraction for the time(and probably will not) and will have in world consequences, physically and morally, with which some of the answers here have also helped a lot.
