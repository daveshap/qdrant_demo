Women who don't put an effort into having a conversation can't complain about dating
I've matched with women who give me one word responses, or they put little effort into keeping the conversation going. 

My general rule of thumb is that I give these women A DAY before I stop talking to them. Does it decrease my options? Yeah. But self respect is way more important than keeping a conversation with a brick wall in the form of a person. 

Seriously. And the funniest thing about all of this is that these same women complain about men playing games with them! My initial reaction to someone not putting an effort into talking is that they're not interested, and I quickly move on. I believe most healthy-minded people would take the hint and keep it moving. 

Don't complain about what you attract if your behavior attracts certain types of people.
