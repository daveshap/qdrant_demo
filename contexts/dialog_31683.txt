CORNELIUS WALDMAN: Herr Falkstein! Did you inform Frederick Frankenstein of this assembly and all the particulars of the time and place?
HERR FALKSTEIN: I did, sir.
HERR FALKSTEIN: But I received a cable only this morning, saying that he could not come.
CORNELIUS WALDMAN: Was he aware of the importance of this occasion?
HERR FALKSTEIN: Yes, sir, he was. But he said he was obligated to lecture at Johns Hopkins University.
CORNELIUS WALDMAN: What lecture could be more important than the will of Baron Beaufort Frankenstein?
HERR FALKSTEIN: 'Functional areas of the cerebrum in relation to the skull.'
ANASTASIA: Excuse me, Mr. Waldman -- excuse me for interrupting. But is Frederick, then...a medical doctor?
CORNELIUS WALDMAN: Yes, my dear, he is.
ANASTASIA: And has he achieved...any special degree of eminence?
CORNELIUS WALDMAN: He is the fifth leading authority in his field.
ANASTASIA: Oh, shit.
CORNELIUS WALDMAN: Herr Falkstein -- you must go at once and present Dr. Frankenstein with all the details of his inheritance. The estate will provide for your journey.
