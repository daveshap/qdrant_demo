Allowing user to choose multiple input files in ArcGIS ModelBuilder? I have built a basic model to run some calculations on a number of feature classes in Model Builder. These tools include Merge, Delete Identical, Make Table, Select Layer Attribute, Delete Rows and a Make XY event layer. Currently the model has a number of feature classes added directly to the model.At the beginning, I would like the user to be able to choose which feature classes they add for processing. It should look like the options you get when using the Merge Tool in ArcMap where the user can browse to the files to be processed. The files could be anywhere on the PC and not necessarily in the same workspace.Is this possible?
