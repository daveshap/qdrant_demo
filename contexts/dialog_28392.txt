LONNEGAN: You should always look to the back too, kid.
HOOKER: I was afraid you weren't gonna come. We haven't got much time.
LONNEGAN: Get on with it then.
HOOKER: Sometime after 1:00 a guy's gonna call here and give you the name of a horse. All you do is take this two grand across the street to Shaw's place and bet it on that pony. There's nothin' to it, but don't take too much time. We only have 3 or 4 minutes after you get the call.
LONNEGAN: You're not gonna break him with a $2,000 bet.
HOOKER: This is just a test. The big one comes later. Be careful with that though, it's all I got.
LONNEGAN: And you were gonna pay me back?
HOOKER: I am after this race.
