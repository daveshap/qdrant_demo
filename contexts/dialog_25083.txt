SEFTON: What happened, Cookie? Who did it?
HOFFY: We did it.
SEFTON: There better not be anything missing. This is private property.
PRICE: So was the radio private property. So was Manfredi and Johnson.
SEFTON: What about the radio?
DUKE: Yeah, what about it? Cut the horsing around. We know he's the stoolie and we know what the pay- off is. Let's get on with it.
SEFTON: Let's get on with what? What is this anyway? A Kangaroo Court? Why don't you get a rope and do it right?
DUKE: You make my mouth water.
SEFTON: You're all wire happy, boys. You've been in this camp too long. You put two and two together and it comes out four. Only it ain't four.
HOFFY: What's it add up to you, Sefton?
SEFTON: It adds up that you got yourselves the wrong guy. Because I'm telling you. The Krauts wouldn't plant two stoolies in one barrack. And whatever you do to me you're going to have to do all over again when you find the right guy.
