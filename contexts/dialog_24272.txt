VAUGHAN: Listen everybody, I know this may sound corny, I've had a few glasses of wine and that kind of makes me a little emotional, but I'm going to say it anyway. It just came over me in a rush. I want you all to know that I care about each and every one of you at this table.
LINDA: That's very sweet of you Vaughan. We care about you, too. Don't we y'all?
VAUGHAN: Also, Melinda, please don't tell anybody at the store that Albert was here tonight, okay.
MELINDA: Why?
VAUGHAN: Well, a lot of people in town talk and spread cruel rumors. Unfortunately, I have to keep certain parts of my life private.
MELINDA: You mean about y'all bein' together in that" way?"
VAUGHAN: Yes.
MELINDA: I think everybody at the store knows that already. They always talk about it. Maureen Ledbetter told a awful story about why you ain't allowed over at the First Baptist Church no more.
LINDA: Karl, why don't you and Melinda go take a walk. It's nice out.
KARL: All right then.
MELINDA: You walk fast, don't you?
KARL: I reckon.
MELINDA: These is the worst shoes I own for walkin'. How far did you want to go?
KARL: I ain't really thought about it too much I don't reckon.
