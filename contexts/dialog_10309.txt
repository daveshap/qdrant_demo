LAUREL: Mother won't tell me how long you've been seeing this person. She's embarrassed to tell me. So why don't you tell me?
NICKY: Don't call her Mother all the time. It makes her sound tragic and unforgiving. What happened to Mom?
LAUREL: I didn't turn her into Mother. You did.
NICKY: This person and I are a thing of the total past. I promise you.
