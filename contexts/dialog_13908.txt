CLAUDIA: Why always on this night?
LESTAT: What night? What do you mean?
CLAUDIA: You always give me the doll on the same night of the year.
LESTAT: I didn't realise.
CLAUDIA: Is this my birthday?
LESTAT: Some of these are so old and tattered. You should throw them away.
CLAUDIA: I have. Or there would be twice as many.
LESTAT: But you're the fairest by far.
CLAUDIA: You dress me like a doll. You make my hair like a doll. Why?
CLAUDIA: You want me to be a doll forever?
LOUIS: Claudia - don't -
CLAUDIA: Why not?
