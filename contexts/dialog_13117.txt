EDDIE: What is it? What's in there?
PRITCHETT: The Soul of the House. Everything that's corrupt about it... My father trapped it in there just before he died. You see, he purchased the house to restore it... We were going to live here... Nothing can live here. I was just a kid... The first time I saw it, I thought it was beautiful... It was just a dark mist turning into the corner of the room... then it started to move... then death started to happen... First the workers.. six in all... then my father...
SARA: Ghosts killed your father?
PRITCHETT: Not ghosts... at least not what you're thinking... Vannacutt used to dump the bodies of his failed experiments somewhere in the house...
SARA: And you think it's in there?
PRITCHETT: Accumulated evil... festering for decades... But I'm a drunk... so don't listen to me.
EDDIE: So you're saying as long as that door stays locked, we're okay?
PRITCHETT: Hell NO!! The House will kill ya!
