Ghosted during onboarding?
The first day of classes is a bit over a week away, and I accepted an offer from Kelly Educational Staffing to be a substitute teacher.  At this point I have completed all of the online parts including the online training, but I haven't been given any information about how I am supposed to schedule myself, and the person in charge of onboarding me hasn't replied to any emails sent asking what sort of timeline there is for the new hire orientation & attempts to call go straight to voice mail.

I'm not sure what to do next, and I have heard that they will call you as early 5AM if they need somebody last-minute but only by lurking on their Glassdoor.  I have no idea how I might go about scheduling myself.  I have no idea when I should expect to be paid.  I *only* know how much I can expect to be paid from searching online.  The new hire training is presumably supposed to cover this, but I have heard literally nothing from them and I know from one of my references that they've never been contacted either.

(At this point: Ha, no, they've already ensured that I am going to keep looking for a different job and they're also now ensuring that the notice I will give them is likely to be a short email or voice mail message informing them that "As of \[this date\], I quit."  With possibly the chorus from Na Na Hey Hey Kiss Him Goodbye added if I'm leaving a voice mail.  They never would be on my resume, so leaving on bad terms isn't going to hurt me.)

So, what should I do now?  Especially since some of the things required from me cost $ and they have had me do training unique to them but seem to consider me an independent contractor?
