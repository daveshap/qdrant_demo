LEDUC: What've you got?
DESK OFFICER: Just a crazy call from a girl, probably fucked up on drugs. I wouldn't bother you but you said call with anything unusual.
LEDUC: What did she say?
DESK OFFICER: Something about a monster, underground, in the catacombs under Place Denfert.
LEDUC: I need two tactical assault squads at Place Denfert immediately. You can tell the commissioner it's a code red.
DESK OFFICER: But Inspector, this girl, I wouldn't call her reliable.
LEDUC: Now!
DESK OFFICER: Yes sir.
