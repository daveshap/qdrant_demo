PENELOPE: Did you see him?
SHUTTLE: Yeah.
PENELOPE: Is he all right?
SHUTTLE: Far as I know.
PENELOPE: Is he coming home?
SHUTTLE: He ditched me. He started running, and I started running, then he lost me in the park.
PENELOPE: The park!
SHUTTLE: It's dark in there. PENELOPE And that's where he is!
SHUTTLE: I figure he ducked in one place and ducked out another.
PENELOPE: You figure!
SHUTTLE: Then I saw this bakery store that was still open, so I bought a birthday cake.
PENELOPE: A what?
SHUTTLE: For Harold. When Paul comes home, we can have some birthday cake.
PENELOPE: How nice.
SHUTTLE: They had this cake somebody else hadn't picked up. It says, Happy Birthday
WOODLY: Happy Birthday
SHUTTLE: We can take off the Wanda June" with a butter knife."
PENELOPE: Did you talk to Paul?
SHUTTLE: Before he started to run. He said his father carried a key to this apartment around his neck--and someday we'd all hear the sound of that key in the door.
PENELOPE: We've got to find him. I want you to show me exactly where you saw him last. And you stay here, Norbert, in case he comes home. That's all he said--the thing about the key?
SHUTTLE: He said one other thing. It wasn't very nice.
PENELOPE: What was it?
SHUTTLE: He told me to take a flying fuck at the moon.
WOODLY: Ooops.
HAROLD: Ooops.
WOODLY: Can I--uh--help you gentlemen?
HAROLD: Gentlemen--that's nice.
WOODLY: You startled me.
