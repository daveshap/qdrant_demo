What are the reasons for not automatically granting citizenship for babies born to US Citizens abroad?
The rule appears to primarily affect the children of naturalized US citizens serving in the armed forces who have not lived in the US for a required period of time, a relatively small number -- estimated to be approximately 100 annually, according to a Defense Department official. It does not impact anyone born in the United States.


What makes this change necessary? Was there abuse? Who, if anyone, benefits from this change?
