Anyone else get really worried and restless ~2 hours before having to leave the house?
Anytime I have an obligation I get really stressed. I can't take a nap cause then I might oversleep, I don't really have enough time to do anything, cook something, watch something....but at the same time it's still too early to leave, cause then I'd just be sitting around at the place

So I just sort of pace around and feel annoyed
