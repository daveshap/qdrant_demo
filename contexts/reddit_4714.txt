If you need help, I’m here. I love listening and helping you all. You’re not a burden on anyone.
This has become a passion of mine. Every time I see the red notification that shows me that someone hasn’t given up yet I get a dopamine rush. So lay it on me, don’t worry about being a burden. I’m always here.
