SIM: What's it smell like?
NEBBLEMAN: Smell? Uh, something like methylcyanoacrylate.
SIM: Like Crazy Glue?
NEBBLEMAN: Yes. That's it. He's got it. Oh God, he's got it!
POPPY: Gently, Ott. Gently.
ARGON: Dr. Nebbleman, I want to know the moment the nanobot arrives. The instant, understand?
NEBBLEMAN: Of course, sir.
SUSAN: Dr. Argon, I know you want to use the nanobot on yourself, but you mustn't. The situation is critical right now. The replicators are growing exponentially. If we wait much longer it will be too late. You have to use the nanobot to stop the meltdown.
ARGON: Dr. Bright, I don't have to do anything.
SUSAN: But in another twenty-four hours the core meltdown will be beyond the stabilization period. There will be no way to stop it.
ARGON: To be brutally honest with you, Susan, as long as the nanobot does to me what it did to that idiot O'Brien, I don't give a rat's ass about what happens after that.
SUSAN: You can't mean that.
ARGON: Come with me, Susan. I want to show you something.
ARGON: Something to drink, Dr. Bright?
SUSAN: No, thank you.
ARGON: You'll forgive me but all the excitement has left me extremely parched. Poppy?
