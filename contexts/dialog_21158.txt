MARGO: I never saw it before.
KILLAINE: Positive?
KILLAINE: Thank you.
BRANDON: Yes, I've seen it before.
KILLAINE: Where?
BRANDON: On Miss Mayfield's balcony.. beside the chaise, I picked it up. Don't ask me why. I ought to know better.
KILLAINE: Quite sure you had no motive?
BRANDON: Could be.
KILLAINE: I rather thought so. And before that, had you ever seen the gun?
BRANDON: No.
KILLAINE: It was lying where on the balcony?
BRANDON: Near his right hand. About a foot away. Perhaps more. Good heavens, one doesn't use a tape measure.
KILLAINE: We do, when we get the chance.
KILLAINE: I needn't keep you any longer, Mr. Clarendon.
CLARENDON: Thank you. It is rather late... and I'm not young anymore. Good night.
MARGO: What about me?
KILLAINE: Not quiet yet.
KILLAINE: You knew Mitchell pretty well, didn't you, Mrs. West?
MARGO: I was in love with him... which shows you the quality of my brains. Why don't you ask her about the gun?
KILLAINE: I shall. From your knowledge of Mitchell, would you say he would be likely to commit suicide?
MARGO: Anybody could commit suicide, if he felt low enough. I've felt it myself.
KILLAINE: Then why not give Miss Mayfield the benefit of the doubt?
MARGO: I'd be delighted to... anytime you can show me the doubt. I'll wrap it up in tissue paper and put a Christmas seals on it for her.
KILLAINE: Thank you very much, Mrs. West.
BRANDON: How about a cup of coffee?
KILLAINE: No thanks. I had some. How would you like to take a walk for, say, half and hour?
