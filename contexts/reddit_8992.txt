How feasible is it for Bernie Sanders to implement the substantially left leaning changes he promised as part of his election campaign, if elected president?

I use "substantially left leaning changes" to mean left leaning relative to Hillary Clinton. Compare [Sanders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernie_Sanders#Political_positions) and [Clinton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_positions_of_Hillary_Clinton#As_described_by_others). (The assumption being that the more center leaning a President is, the easier it is to mostly agree to him/her for Congress, and by extension his/her proposed bills.)

I am looking at these promises he made in terms of feasibility of implementation:

*     He will break up big financial institutions. [Read more](https://berniesanders.com/issues/reforming-wall-street/). He has also promised to remove private bank(er)s from the board of the federal reserve. [Read more](http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/dec/23/bernie-sanders-wall-street-federal-reserve-bankers).
*    Break up lobbying by regulating how campaigns receive funding, promoting small donations. [Read more](https://berniesanders.com/issues/money-in-politics/).
*    He has said he would tax the top 0.3% richest US citizens to give benefits to the rest, such as making public colleges tuition free. [Read more here](https://berniesanders.com/issues/income-and-wealth-inequality/) and [here](https://berniesanders.com/issues/its-time-to-make-college-tuition-free-and-debt-free/).
*    He has said he would try to achieve peace in the middle east by diplomacy, and engage in military action only with support from allies and in limited scope. [Read more](https://berniesanders.com/issues/war-and-peace/).


To what extent will factors like scope of presidential authority, Congress, big financial institutions, allied countries etc. influence the feasibility of implementing these policies?

As an example while Barack Obama is the current President: 

* He  wanted to shutdown Guantanamo Bay and Congress said [nope](http://www.nbcnews.com/id/30826649/ns/politics-capitol_hill/). 
* He campaigned for raise of minimum wage, but only a few states [agreed](http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/obamas-2014-report-card). 
* Big Financial Institutions through lobbying Congress were able to [pressurize](http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2011/08/01/wall-street-continues-to-spend-big-on-lobbying/) regulators against many reforms for financial responsibility post the 2008 bailout.
* [Obama Care](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patient_Protection_and_Affordable_Care_Act) was met with resistance from multiple court cases, Congress, individual state implementations.


P.S- I am a first time submitter here, and new to US politics, so I welcome a chance to improve my understanding.
