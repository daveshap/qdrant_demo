MARGE: Tom?
RIPLEY: Marge, I'm in the bath. Won't be long.
MARGE: Tom, I need to talk to you. It's urgent.
MARGE: I found Dickie's rings.
RIPLEY: What?
MARGE: You've got Dickie's rings.
RIPLEY: I can explain.
MARGE: Dickie promised me he would never take off this ring.
RIPLEY: Let me put on some clothes and then we can talk about this.
MARGE: I have to tell Mr Greenleaf. I have to tell Mr Greenleaf. I have to tell Mr Greenleaf.
RIPLEY: Marge, calm down, you're being hysterical.
MARGE: He promised me. I swear I'll never take off this ring until the day --
RIPLEY: Shut up! Shut up!
