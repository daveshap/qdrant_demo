ESCOBAR: I don't suppose you got any idea Where she went?
GITTES: Matter of fact I do.
ESCOBAR: Where?
GITTES: Her maid's house. I think she knows something's up.
ESCOBAR: What's the maid's address?
GITTES: She lives in Pedro. I'll write it down for you.
ESCOBAR: No, Gittes, you'll show us.
GITTES: What for?
ESCOBAR: If she's not there, you're going downtown, and you're staying there til she shows up.
GITTES: Gee, Lou, I'm doing the best I can.
ESCOBAR: Tell us about it on the way to Pedro.
ESCOBAR: That's it?
GITTES: Yeah.
ESCOBAR: Well, let's go.
GITTES: Do me a favor, will you, Lou?
