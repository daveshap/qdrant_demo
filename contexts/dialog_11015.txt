WILLIAMSON: Mmm.
LEVENE: You can't think on your feet you should keep your mouth closed. You hear me? I'm talking to you. Do you hear me...?
WILLIAMSON: Yes. I hear you.
LEVENE: You can't learn that in an office. Eh? He's right. You have to learn it on the streets. You can't buy that. You have to live it.
WILLIAMSON: Mmm.
LEVENE: Yes. Mmm. Yes. Precisely. Precisely. 'Cause your partner depends on it. I'm talking to you, I'm trying to tell you something.
WILLIAMSON: You are?
LEVENE: Yes, I am.
WILLIAMSON: What are you trying to tell me?
LEVENE: What Roma's trying to tell you. What I told you yesterday. Why you don't belong in this business.
WILLIAMSON: Why I don't...
LEVENE: You listen to me, someday you might say, Hey..." No
WILLIAMSON: Excuse me...
LEVENE: ...excuse me, nothing, you be as cold as you want, but you just fucked a good man out of six thousand dollars and his goddamn bonus 'cause you didn't know the shot, if you can do that and you aren't man enough that it gets you, then I don't know what, if you can't take some thing from that... you're scum, you're fucking white- bread. You be as cold as you want. A child would know it, he's right. You're going to make something up, be sure it will help or keep your mouth closed.
