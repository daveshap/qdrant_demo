Am I wrong for being so pissed off?
Right now I am angrier at my girlfriend than I have ever been. 

A couple of months ago, we discovered that our favorite comedian was coming to our town. To our dismay, we also discovered that tickets were already sold out. Bummer, man. 

A couple of days later, we found that he would be in another town about three hours away, but with tickets 1/3 the price of the hometown show. We scooped up tickets for me, her, her best friend, and her best friend's boyfriend. 

A couple of days before the show, her friend had some shit go down and wouldn't be able to make it. That's tough, but my girlfriend and I could still go! But, twas not to be. Girlfriend decided that she wouldn't go without friend. That's a hair frustrating, but completely understandable! That's what good friends do. No problem. 

Two days ago, girlfriend informs me that she and friend found someone selling tickets on craigslist and they are going to the show. What the fuck. If she won't go without her friend, why the hell would it be okay to go without me? It's not like this is just some random fun thing to do. I've been looking forward to seeing this guy for years, and my girlfriend and I have been planning on going to see him together for around a year, before we knew he was coming. Am I stupid for being so goddamn fucking angry about this?
