HARRY: You know Lloyd, the real treasure is our friendship.
LLOYD: How true. But I still feel I deserve more than you do of this treasure. I mean, I found it.
HARRY: But my mom gave me the map.
LLOYD: I lugged it all over town!
HARRY: I made the polar bear pants.
LLOYD: But I ate your Mom's pie.
HARRY: I... found that rock.
LLOYD: It was a diamond and you swallowed it.
LLOYD: Enough! Look what this cursed chest is doing to us.
HARRY: I don't know who we are anymore.
LLOYD: I have no idea - it's full of files and documents and tapes.
HARRY: Do you know what this means?
