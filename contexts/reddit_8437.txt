What does it mean to, "solicit, accept, or receive anything of value from a foreign national in connection with a U.S. election"?
The Chairman of the Federal Election Commission has [posted a notice](https://www.fec.gov/resources/cms-content/documents/Chair_Weintraub_on_Illegal_Foreign_Contributions.pdf) reminding us of [52 U.S.C. § 30121(a)(2), *Contributions and donations by foreign nationals*](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/52/30121):

> &nbsp; Let me make something 100% clear to the American public and anyone running for public office:  It  is  illegal  for  any  person  to  solicit,  accept,  or  receive  anything  of  value  from  a  foreign  national  in  connection  with  a  U.S.  election.^1  This  is  not  a  novel  concept.  Electoral intervention from foreign governments has been considered unacceptable since the beginnings of our nation. Our  Founding  Fathers  sounded  the  alarm  about  “foreign  Interference,  Intrigue,  and  Influence.”  They  knew  that  when  foreign  governments  seek  to  influence  American  politics,  it  is  always  to  advance their own interests, not America’s. Anyone who solicits or accepts foreign assistance risks being on the wrong end of a federal investigation. Any political campaign that receives an offer of a  prohibited  donation from  a  foreign  source  should  report  that  offer  to  the  Federal  Bureau  of  Investigation.

She tweeted out a link to it in June:

So...

* What does it mean exactly to, "solicit,  accept,  or  receive  anything  of  value  from  a  foreign  national  in  connection  with  a  U.S.  election"?
* Are there any examples of this law being applied in the past? What was the nature of the violation? What was the penalty?
