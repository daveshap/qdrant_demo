Week 1 of training and I already want to quit
Hey everyone! I just finished my first week of training for my new job and I am feeling really unsure about all of this. I am training to be a fisheries observer in Alaska, and am currently in Seattle for a 3 week training. This is my first job out of college and being this far and isolated from my family is really difficult. The training is very rigorous (12 hours/ day) and has a high fail rate. I am living with 5 others in the training class (apt. Is provided by company) and I feel like I’m not really making friends. Our teachers say that the training is the hardest part of the job, but I’m afraid that once I go to AK I’m going to hate it as much as I hate this training. Does anyone have any experience with this job specifically and/or training difficulties? Did things improve once you finished training?
