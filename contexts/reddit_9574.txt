Applying for SA jobs during COVID-19
So I found a student engagement & housing position the other day and applied for it. It's at a small private institution. Given the current COVID-19 pandemic, would you all say that institutions are looking to fill vacant positions or hold off on it? 

I should also add that the job posting didnt have a published date or anything.  After I submitted my application this week I saw it posted on a job board (not higheredjobs.com) and it says the position was posted March 3rd. I'm hoping they're still accepting applicants
