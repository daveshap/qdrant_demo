MICHAEL: What makes you think he'll do it?
CAMERON: He seems like he thrives on danger
MICHAEL: No kidding. He's a criminal. I heard he lit a state trooper on fire. He just got out of Alcatraz...
CAMERON: They always let felons sit in on Honors Biology?
MICHAEL: I'm serious, man, he's whacked. He sold his own liver on the black market so he could buy new speakers.
CAMERON: Forget his reputation. Do you think we've got a plan or not?
MICHAEL: Did she actually say she'd go out with you?
CAMERON: That's what I just said
MICHAEL: You know, if you do go out with Bianca, you'd be set. You'd outrank everyone. Strictly A-list. With me by your side.
CAMERON: I thought you hated those people.
MICHAEL: Hey -- I've gotta have a few clients when I get to Wall Street.
