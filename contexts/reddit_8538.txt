Allegations of election fraud
Several activists [are currently lobbying](http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/11/activists-urge-hillary-clinton-to-challenge-election-results.html?mid=facebook_nymag) for Clinton to challenge results of the election in Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania due to possible vote tampering. They found that counties in which electronic ballots were used ended up with 7 percent fewer votes than counties which depended on paper ballots, and suggest that this is due to vote manipulation. This may be connected to "Audit the Vote," which Snopes discusses [here](http://www.snopes.com/audit-the-vote/).

However, the sources I find on this are generally pretty biased. Any idea whether these allegations hold water?
