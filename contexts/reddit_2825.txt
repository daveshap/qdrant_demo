Unhappy in a new job. Is it an awful move to resign after two weeks?
 

Hi Reddit!   


I am in my third week of my first permanent job post-college, and I've realized that this job might not be for me. During the interview process, I was told that my job would entail significant daily human interaction and interpersonal cooperation, which I personally need to be happy and productive. My first two weeks, however, have generally consisted of over seven-and-a-half plus hours of uninterrupted time in front of a computer screen and a few short minutes of small-talk with coworkers -  a schedule that has me quickly becoming depressed in my cubicle. Almost all of my limited work with others has been done via email. Before my hiring, they mentioned to me that there may be "the occasional day of 8 hour screen time," but that it would be the exception.  


I'm seriously considering quitting, as I was just assigned a several-month long project that is not likely to change my work situation. I'm at a loss, because I never envisioned myself in a situation like this, and especially not after so short a time. I don't ever plan on being a job-hopper.  


My biggest concern with moving on is that I fear wasting the resources of the organization that hired me, and I also don't want the HR Manager and my boss to get in trouble for bringing me in and then me leaving so soon, since they were both responsible for hiring someone who would be able to come in and do important things immediately. They are both wonderful people who I don't want to put in a bad situation by leaving.   


That said, this schedule and job are killing me thus far, and I don't see myself staying long-term anyways.   


Any advice is appreciated.
