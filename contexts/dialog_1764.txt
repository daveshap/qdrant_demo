Z: Sorry Azteca. Here you go, fellas! Fresh dirt! Alley oop! Shouldn't we be wearing gloves? I mean this dirt is very...dirty. Doesn't anyone think of hygiene? Boy am I hungry. I'm so hungry I'm seeing double. It looks like there's <u>two</u> million ants in here. When's lunch? Tomorrow, or the day after?
AZTECA: Z, old pal... SHUT UP!!! It's bad enough there's a food shortage without you complaining about it every day.
Z: The squeaky wheel gets the oil.
AZTECA: No, Z. The squeaky wheel gets <u>thrown</u> <u>away</u>, alright? You're a good ant, Z, even though you are a pain in my rear- segment. I don't wanna see anything happen to you. So quit mouthing off, before you get in trouble.
Z: Thank goodness. Breaktime.
AZTECA: Break's over.
Z: This colony needs another tunnel like a hole in the ground. Why are we even digging this thing?
AZTECA: Who cares, Z. All I know is, we gotta dig. We're not the ones in charge.
