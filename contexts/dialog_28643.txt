WES: Jaeger?
JAEGER: What!?
WES: You ever think about dying?
JAEGER: Come on, man. I almost had this thing open.
WES: You ever think about it? You ever worry?
JAEGER: The only thing I worry about is how much Iraqi ass I'm going to be able to kick before this whole thing is over. The only people who I've got anything to worry about are the poor, dumb camel jockeys who don't know enough to get out of the way when I come rolling at them; an M-16 in each hand, and a grenade between my teeth. Now if you'll excuse me, soldier, I'd like to get back to my box. I've got a treasure to find.
