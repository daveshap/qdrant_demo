Calculating nearest distance between polygons according to attribute field in ArcGIS Desktop? I have a two polygon shapefiles, one shapefile\u00a0is a zoning\u00a0and the second one is a census tract. Now I want to calculate distance from boundary of tract to closest boundary of each zone type (R, C, etc). Because of that I have dissolved all zones according to zone type and now\u00a0I want to have in each census tract information about nearest distance to the all zone types (distance to C, distance to R, etc...). I am using ArcGIS 10.4 and have trid to use NEAR tool,  spatial join but I can't get a distances to all zone types,  just to the nearest one. Also I want to have a zero distance value if each tract contain the zone type or intersect it.
