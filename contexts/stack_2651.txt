Interacting OpenLayers with GeoServer I am new to OpenLayers. I need guidance on below.I am able to create map using OpenLayers and able to create polygon interactions on the map and able to extract as GeoJSON object with coordinates.Now I need to send this GeoJSON request to my GeoServer to get the intersected grids on the OpenLayers (grids are configured in GeoServer).How can I achieve this using RESTful API?
