Importing and synching polygons from a Google Spreadsheet into Carto - can it be done? I have used Google Spreadsheets as a way to provide our large organisation a way to update carto maps with new locations without needing to consistently contact the web/GIS teams but only with pushpins.I now have had a request to do this using polygons however I have no clue of if Carto will import (and synch) polygons from Google Spreadsheets and what format the geo-area field should be. The polygons do not change, just the values associated to the fields.Any help or a sample spreadsheet would be wonderful.e.g.<br>    District     | geojson | population |<br>    North East   | geojson | 2,340,000 |
