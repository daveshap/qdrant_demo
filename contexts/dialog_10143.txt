STEVEN: What do you mean you've never made a prank call?
VICKI: Never.
STEVEN: You mean never as in really never, or never as in it was just so stupid you don't want to tell us about it?
VICKI: I mean really never.
STEVEN: I'm sorry to hear that. A famous man once said -- there is no worse regret then a temptation resisted.
RANDY: Jesus, Steven, that's...that's really lovely.
STEVEN: I mean, how can you go through life without never having made a prank call?
RANDY: Hell, when Steven was a kid, he was like, having strippers delivered to church Bingos and shit.
VICKI: That's disgusting.
STEVEN: Disgusting? Bingo night was sold out for six months after that! They raised enough money to build a day care center.
RANDY: It was a community service.
STEVEN: Absolutely. The church even sent me an autographed picture of God. Ward!
