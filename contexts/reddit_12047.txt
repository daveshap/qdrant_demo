Homecoming Date
Homecoming is in a week and I bought two tickets hoping to ask a girl to go with me. I am really shy and awkward when it comes to people I like so I come off as such. The thing is I don't think she likes me, we talk but she seems like she is purposely trying to distance herself from me. I'm a hopeless romantic and I planned everything out perfectly in my head, but she already bought a ticket. Now I'm in an awkward situation, I am terrified of being rejected and I'm too afraid to even ask her to go because the thought of her saying no is heartbreaking. She knows I bought two tickets but she doesn't know I wanted to ask her to homecoming, she has me so far in the friend zone she even wants to help me ask a girl to homecoming. I know this isn't the place to ask but what do I do? Any suggestions would be great. Any motivational words to give me the balls to actually ask her would be kindly appreciated too.
