Give me a reason to live.
My situation with my family has been shitty for years now. Long story short...I came back for 10 days for the obligatory visit. And my mum just yelled at me because I was upset. Upset that she didn't express any happiness that i got shortlisted for an interview with my dream company. She says I'm weak for expecting expressions of joy when I should apparantly already know they're happy for me. She said some pretty shitty stuff and honestly I've lost all hope. I genuinely cannot take it anymore. 

I need reasons. Reasons not to end everything. God sometimes I just want to stab myself dead or overdose on antideps because nothing I do ever works. Never good enough. Too sensitive. Too weak. Too this too that. I've had it.

Please help...

UPDATE: I took a nap after typing this out and woke up to some of the kindest words I've ever heard from a bunch of strangers. I wish I could personally thank every single one of you. It helped me feel less alone you know? I cried while replying to you guys it was just so necessary for me to reach out here today or I don't know what I would've done. I was at wits end before I posted this and it isnt the first time I've seriously considered and visualized suicide.

I love you guys. I don't even know you all but I hope you feel it..wherever you are.
