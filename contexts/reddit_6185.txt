Offered a position to a work from home. Need a newer computer for it.
So I have a job offer for a call center home position. The computer requirements are slightly higher than my current computer. It needs an i5 core processor 2.8GHz and mines is 2.5GHz. 
I don’t have much money at the moment but I do have some credit available, which I strongly do not want to utilize because that’s a bad idea. 

I’d like some advice. Essentially do I put myself in debt for a newer laptop or leave the offer and hope it’s around in a month(I should get some type of refund) 


Also if anyone happens to know any under $400 windows laptops with those and at least 500GB of storage and 4GB of ram? (Probably not ideal to ask here, but) I looked online and learned it’s a nightmare to look for computers based on processor specs. 



Oh, and I should mention I’m employed full time so I’m not in a strong need to accept it.
