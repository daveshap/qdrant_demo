In marketing experiment, can we determine the effect customer state has on response? We have the goal of determining whether an email campaign has an impact on the amount of product that customers purchase. We have customers from several states but much more from some states than others. Customers from some states do in general buy more than customers from others.Suppose we randomly assign 10% of the customers to the control group (they will not receive the email). Are we going to be able to determine what effect state has on customer response? Is there some obvious way this experiment should be analyzed?
