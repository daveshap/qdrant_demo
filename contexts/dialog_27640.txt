OLD TIM: Can I... Can I t-t-talk to you?
PETE: Sure. Come on in. I was just packing.
PETE: Please, sit.
OLD TIM: Thanks.
OLD TIM: They'll come back, you know. They'll all c-c-come back.
PETE: The customers? I don't know...
OLD TIM: They will. They w-w-will.
PETE: Tim, I have to tell you something.
OLD TIM: Oh.
PETE: It's about me.
OLD TIM: Oh.
PETE: I'm... I'm not Luke. Luke is dead. He died in the war. He's not coming back, and I'm not him. I don't even belong here. This whole thing started out as an accident, and that's all it is. An accident.
OLD TIM: Oh...
PETE: My name isn't Luke. It's Peter. Peter Appleton.
OLD TIM: Did you think I didn't kn-kn-know that?
PETE: I thought you...
OLD TIM: I know more than you give me c-c- credit, that's for sure. Don't you see, it don't m-m-matter who you are? All that matters is what you g-g-gave us. And you can't take that away now. You're wrong, Peter Appleton. You do belong here.
