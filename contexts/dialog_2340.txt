LANDON: What's with the friggin numbers?
JAMIE: 28 is do something illegal. 42 is befriend an enemy.
LANDON: I'm an enemy?
JAMIE: Kinda. Yeah.
JAMIE: The reason I got the part... I'm a little like Lizzie. Except I don't worry about some man rescuing me.
LANDON: Good thing.
LANDON: You got some kind of list?
JAMIE: Are you asking to mock me or do you really want to know?
LANDON: Maybe a little of both.
JAMIE: I'll take a chance.
LANDON: Go for it.
JAMIE: It's like a to-do list, but for my life.
