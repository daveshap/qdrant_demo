Family not supporting my choice for adoption
My family has told me they just want what’s best for me. But I feel underlying pressure from especially my mom and older sister to keep my baby. Actually underlying is the wrong word, they desperately want me to keep this baby. And they don’t hide it at all. It hurts my feelings, because they claim to be my biggest supporters, although they’re only thinking about themselves. My mom referred me to this “adoption agency” so I filled out the form trusting her completely (how naive of me). When the woman from the organization called me, she was only trying to manipulate me to back out of adoption. I’m not exaggerating. I felt completely attacked. When I confronted my mom about it she got pissed at me, said “I think you should know all the facts” she completely blind sighted me. I understand her hurt for this situation, but she’s my mother and she’s completely manipulating me. Meanwhile my sister is knitting blankets and buying outfits. How can I make a choice for myself when I feel absolutely alone??
