Do you have this strange guilty feeling when you have some money in the bank for once?
I live on very low income, and I never had any savings despite living on a very tight budget. I always struggled financially. I kept on working during the pandemic so the stimulus check was like unexpected bonus money and right now it's safe in my bank account. It feels good to have something in the bank in case of an emergency but at the same time it feels too good to be true, to the point of giving me feelings both of guilt and impeding doom. Like I'm not meant to have that, I don't deserve it, and I'm cheating karma and it's going to take a revenge on me. It's not that it makes me want to spend it, not at all, it's just that it feels like something I shouldn't have. Is it just me being weird or can you relate? How do you get out of that mindset?
