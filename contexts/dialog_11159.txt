CLAY: I never made it to Korea.
WHALE: But you said --
CLAY: -- that I was a Marine. Which is true. You filled in the rest.
WHALE: I see.
CLAY: My old man was a Marine. He enlisted the day he turned seventeen.
WHALE: The Great War?
CLAY: By the time he was ready to ship out, the fighting was over. He missed out.
WHALE: A very lucky thing indeed.
CLAY: That's not the way he saw it. To him, it was like his life never got started. Nothing else really mattered. Definitely not his family.
CLAY: The morning after Pearl Harbor, he drove down to St. Louis to reenlist. He was so damn excited. World War II was going to be his second chance. They told him he was too old...fat ...nearsighted. Said he'd be more use to his country if he stayed home and looked after his family.
WHALE: Is that why you joined the Marines? For your father's sake?
CLAY: I figured he'd think, you know -- it was the next best thing. Hey, I loved it too. A chance to be a part of something important. Something bigger than yourself.
WHALE: What happened?
CLAY: I didn't have the guts for it.
