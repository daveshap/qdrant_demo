How much will macOS High Sierra upgrade cost me? I have a Mac running OS X Mountain Lion 10.8.5. unfortunately I am not very good at installing new programmes on my computer, and I want to update mine to the latest release macOS High Sierra.What will it cost me if I go the the Mac shop at the Metro centre to have it installed?
