DR. ARMBRUSTER: The HIV virus can only be transmitted through the exchange of bodily fluids, namely blood and semen.
JOE: Right.
DR. ARMBRUSTER: Leave that.
JOE: Yeah, but Doc, isn't it true they keep finding out new things about this disease? So you tell me, today, there's no danger, and I go home, and I hold my baby, and six months from now I hear on the news: whoops! We were wrong.' You <u>can</u> carry it on your clothes
DR. ARMBRUSTER: We're going to draw blood.
JOE: Why are we going to do that?
DR. ARMBRUSTER: Joe. I don't care a whit about your private life.
JOE: You want to give me an AIDS <u>test</u>?!
JOE: The guy sat in my office! You can't get AIDS that way, right?
DR. ARMBRUSTER: Right.
JOE: It doesn't travel through the air, by breathing, or touching, right?
DR. ARMBRUSTER: Not by touching, or shaking hands, or hugging, using the same toilet... Even kissing someone with AIDS is safe. But it there's something in your past you're worried about...
JOE: Thanks, Doc, but I don't need an AIDS test. Are you crazy? But thanks for the information. Really.
