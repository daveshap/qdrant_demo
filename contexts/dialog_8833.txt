DR. KLEIN: A disorder of the nerves. At least we think it is. We don't know yet exactly how it works, but it's often seen in earl adolescence. She shows all the symptoms: the hyperactivity; the temper; her performance in math.
CHRIS: Why the math?
DR. KLEIN: It affects concentration.
DR. KLEIN: Now this is for Ritalin. Ten miligrams a day.
CHRIS: What is it? A tranquilizer?
DR. KLEIN: A stimulant.
CHRIS: Stimulant? She's higher than a kite right now!
DR. KLEIN: Her condition isn't quite what it seems. Nobody knows the cause of her hyperkinetic behaviour in a child. The Ritalin sems to work to relieve the condition, but we really don't know how or why, frankly. Your daughter's symptoms could be an overreaction to depression- but that's out of my field.
CHRIS: Depression?
DR. KLEIN: Well, you mentioned her father... the divorce.
CHRIS: Do you think I should take her to see a psychiatrist?
DR. KLEIN: Oh no. I'd wait and see what happens with the Ritalin. I think that's the answer. Wait two or three weeks.
CHRIS: And those lies she's been telling?
DR. KLEIN: Lies?
CHRIS: Ya know, those things to get attention, like saying that her bed shakes and stuff.
DR. KLEIN: Have you ever known your daughter to swear and use obscenities?
CHRIS: Never.
DR. KLEIN: Well, you see, that's quite similar to things like her lying- uncharacter-
CHRIS: Wait a minute. What are you talking about?
DR. KLEIN: Well, she let loose quite a string while I was examining her, Mrs. MacNeil.
CHRIS: You're kidding! Like what?
DR. KLEIN: Well, I'd say her vocabulary's rather extensive.
CHRIS: Well, what, for example? I mean, give me a for instance!
CHRIS: Hey, come on, I'm grown-up. What'd she say? I mean specifically, Doctor.
DR. KLEIN: Well, specifically, Mrs. MacNeil, she advised me to keep my fingers away from her goddam cunt.
CHRIS: She used those words?
DR. KLEIN: She used those words. Look, I doubt that she even understood what she was saying.
CHRIS: Yeah, I guess. Maybe not. You don't think a psychiatrist-?
DR. KLEIN: The best explanation is always the simplest one. Let's wait. Let's wait and see. In the meantime try not to worry.
