GENERAL SCHMUCK: Go back to sleep, baby.
COLONEL PUNTRICH: What did you say, sir?
GENERAL SCHMUCK: I didn't say anything. What's the meaning of disturbing me at this hour, Colonel?
COLONEL PUNTRICH: General Schmuck, we monitored a trans- mission about six minutes ago from Burpelson Air Force Base, HQ 843rd Wing. It was apparently directed to their Wing on air- borne alert. It decoded as - Wing attack, Plan-R.
GENERAL SCHMUCK: Colonel, you're not drunk, are you, man?
COLONEL PUNTRICH: No, sir.
GENERAL SCHMUCK: Then why bother me with this nonsense? Get in touch with the base commander.
