LADY: You'll be looking forward to getting back, then.
WILSON: Yeah. Another little matter needs attending to soon as I return.
LADY: No rest for the wicked.
WILSON: Been away a lot.
LADY: Where else?
WILSON: Out on a oil rig. In the North Sea. Nine years.
LADY: Nine years? Is that legal?
WILSON: Well, time off for good behavior, you know. I shouldn't have even been there -- it was these other blokes who shoulda gone in my place. I got lumbered with the job they were responsible for. I don't mind pulling me own cart, but not someone else's, know what I mean.
LADY: But you stuck it out, anyway, all that time.
WILSON: I had to, didn't I. Nothing else for it. Then just when I'd finished my nine years -- my contract -- wallop, I had to bugger off to the States.
LADY: Sounds like you need a rest.
WILSON: Could do, yeah.
WILSON: But first I gotta give these lads a talking to, these geezers what sent me up the river, in a manner of speaking.
LADY: The ones whose burden you took upon your own shoulders.
WILSON: Yeah.
