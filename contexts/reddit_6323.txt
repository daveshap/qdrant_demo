New Position
I was the victim of a downsizing layoff last year after over a decade of service. 

I started a job hunt and found one with a large company in the same industry. I work remotely but I have been here now for two months and hear from next to nobody and have only had a handful of meetings. I have some online training links that I have done and that has been about it. I sit in silence and nothing seems to happen. 

I am getting restless sitting all day and the role doesn't seem ready or not defined. Am I being overly impatient? I was remote in my previous position so I know how to make that work. Keep the job search fires burning? Climbing the walls.
