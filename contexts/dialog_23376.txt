GREGORY: We're not exactly strangers, Mary. Jacqueline spoke about you often. I suppose she told you about me,
MARY: No...At the morgue they told me a Mr. Gregory Ward had made inquiries about Jacqueline.
GREGORY: The Morgue? No wonder you fainted. I wish you had come to me first.
MARY: Then you know where Jacqueline is?
GREGORY: But I'd give a great deal to know.
MARY: Why?
GREGORY: I love your sister, Mary. I love her very much.
