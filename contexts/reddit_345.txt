Hey, just a quick bit of input..
This CSS fucking sucks!!!! Who the fuck is the shitty programmer who did this? okay subreddit idea, but the CSS really is fucking horrible! The submit button doesn't even work. I had to go the front page, and submit a post and change the subreddit to AdviceForTeens. The colors and highlighting fucking suck, the dr seuss quote in the back looks bad and doesn't go with the theme or the subreddit, the upsmiles look like shit, the font looks like shit, there's some weird chick staring at me from the corner of the screen in a blurred out bubble, and everything else looks like shit. I'd be happy to help if you guys need help with the CSS, just don't ban me for saying this shit. I'm just giving you guys some constructive criticism because I can't look at the subreddit for 5 minutes without my eyes hurting. Also, Kyle, stop asking people to promote this and shit. Just let people come and maybe post it a few times yourself to [/r/teenagers](/r/teenagers) and [/r/highseddit](/r/highseddit)  and stuff. Anyway, change the CSS or just make me mod so i can do it myself. Thanks for listening, and remember i'm not hating on the subreddit I just think it looks like shit. lol
