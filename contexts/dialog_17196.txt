MARTY: This is the kitchen.
CLARA: Yes, I know.
MARTY: Come on inna dining room.
MARTY: Siddown, take off your coat. You want something to eat? We gotta whole half-chicken in the icebox.
CLARA: No, thank you. I don't think I should stay very long.
MARTY: Sure. Just take off your coat a minute.
MARTY: So I was telling you, my kid brother Nickie got married last Sunday. That was a very nice affair. And they had this statue of some woman, and they had whiskey spouting outta her mouth. I never saw anything so grand in my life. And watta meal. I'm a butcher, so I know a good hunka steak when I see one. That was choice filet, right off the toppa the chuck. A buck eighty a pound. Of course, if you wanna cheaper cut, get rib steak. That gotta lotta waste on it, but it comes to about a buck and a quarter a pound, if it's trimmed. Listen, Clara, make yourself comfortable. You're all tense.
CLARA: Oh, I'm fine.
MARTY: You want me to take you home, I'll take you home.
CLARA: Maybe that would be a good idea.
CLARA: No, Marty, please...
MARTY: I like you. I like you. I been telling you all night, I like you...
CLARA: Marty...
MARTY: I just wanna kiss, that's all.
CLARA: No...
MARTY: Please...
CLARA: No...
MARTY: Please...
CLARA: Marty...
