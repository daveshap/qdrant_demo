Terminal command to quit Google's \"Backup and Sync\"? Is there a terminal command I can use to quit Google's \"Backup and Sync\" software?  I am writing a Bash script to set the machine up for maximum battery life and I would like to shutdown all non-essential software that I usually have running in the background such as Backup and Sync.  I tried the usual suspects (osascript -e 'tell app \"Backup and Sync from Google\" to quit' AND killall 'Backup and Sync from Google') without success.
