Boss keeps saying she’ll be here soon to show me things and leaves me for hours
So it’s my third week. I still don’t know how to do 90 percent of job because my boss keeps saying she’ll show me things soon and then it will be hours before she comes over even with me checking in to see where she is (when I do check in on her, she says ‘I’ll be over in just a minute’ or ‘over in 15’ and then doesn’t come for hours so I start to feel annoying and like I’m burdening her). When she does eventually come, she usually just gives me busy work and doesn’t divulge in or educate me on my recurring responsibilities that I have. Now, I’m imagining that when she tells me she’ll be here in ‘just a minute’ she actually goes back into her office and laughs about leaving me with nothing to do for hours. 

How do I handle this situation? Am I supposed to teach myself? I told her that I need to know the contacts and and general info for the newsletter in order to put it together and she says she’ll sit with me but my god it doesn’t take 2 hours to send an email. Is she bad at her job or am I bad at mine? There’s no one else I can go to to ask.
