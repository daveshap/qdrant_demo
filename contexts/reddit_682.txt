How to make best friend like me again
My best friend is mad at me. I mean we started talking again, but when I asked them if we're friends again they just said "idk". What can I do to help them like me again? I said sorry, I tried to give them cakes and cookies but they said they didn't even want it. I've done "gross things" for them and that kinda help, but what more can I do? :(
