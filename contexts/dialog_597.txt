MOTHER MIRIAM: You hate us don't you?
MARTHA: What?
MOTHER MIRIAM: Nuns... you hate nuns.
MARTHA: I hate ignorance and stupidity.
MOTHER MIRIAM: The Catholic Church...
MARTHA: I haven't said anything against the the Catholic Church.
MOTHER MIRIAM: Catholicism is not on trial here. I want you to deal with Agnes without any religious prejudice or you turn this case over to someone else...
MARTHA: How dare you tell me to run my affairs!
MOTHER MIRIAM: It's my affair too.
MARTHA: How dare you think I'm in a position to be pressured...
MOTHER MIRIAM: I'm only interested...
MARTHA: ... or bullied or what ever you're doing. Who the hell do you think you are? You go around here expecting applause for the way you treated this child.
MOTHER MIRIAM: She is not a child.
MARTHA: And she has a right to know that there's a world out there filled with people who don't believe in God... ... and aren't any worse off than you Mother. People who've gone through their entire lives without bending their knees once, to anybody. And people who fall in love and have babies and occas- sionally are very happy. She has a right to know that. But you and your... your order and your Church have kept her ignorant...
MOTHER MIRIAM: ???
MARTHA: ??? ... virginity, right Mother? Poverty, chastity and ignorance is what you live by.
MOTHER MIRIAM: I am not a virgin, Doctor. I was married for twenty three years, two daughters. I even have grandchildren... surprised? It might please you to know that I was a failure as a wife and mother. My children won't even see me any more, that's their revenge. I think they tell their friends that I've passed on. And don't tell me I'm making up for past mistakes Doctor Freud.
MARTHA: Then help her.
MOTHER MIRIAM: I am...
MARTHA: No, you're shielding her. Let her face the world.
MOTHER MIRIAM: What good would it do. No matter what you decide it's either the... the prison or the nut house and the differences between them are pretty thin.
MARTHA: There's another choice.
MOTHER MIRIAM: What?
MARTHA: Aquittal.
MOTHER MIRIAM: How?
MARTHA: Innocence. Legal innocence. I know the judge would be happy for any reason to throw this case out of court.
MOTHER MIRIAM: All right, what do you need.
MARTHA: Answers.
MARTHA: When would Agnes have conceived the child?
MOTHER MIRIAM: Oh, some time in January.
MARTHA: Do you remember anything unusual happening at the time?
MOTHER MIRIAM: Earthquakes?
MARTHA: Visitors to the convent.
MOTHER MIRIAM: Nothing.
MARTHA: Do you have a... a diary or a day book?
MOTHER MIRIAM: Yes.
MARTHA: Take at look at it.
MOTHER MIRIAM: There's nothing here.
MARTHA: Was the child full term?
MOTHER MIRIAM: Oh, Dear God...
MARTHA: What is it?
MOTHER MIRIAM: The sheets...
MARTHA: What sheets?
MOTHER MIRIAM: Oh, Dear God, I should have guessed...
