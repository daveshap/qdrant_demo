ADELE: ...Hey you're good. Thought you said you never played before?
CARRIE: I haven't... I'm a fast learner.
EARLY: ...They never caught that Black Dolya Killer, huh?
BRIAN: Dahlia, no.
EARLY: Now why is that?
BRIAN: Some people think it's because he never killed again. He just disappeared back into society.
EARLY: You don't sound too convinced 'bout that?
BRIAN: I always thought it was the work of a serial killer. Anyone who took that much time and care bisecting another human being must have been enjoying it and would have done it again. And again. Until someone stopped him.
EARLY: That your... theory"
BRIAN: Yeah.
EARLY: You wanna hear mine?
BRIAN: Sure.
EARLY: Ain't you goin' to record it?
