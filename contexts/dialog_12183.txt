FELICE: You're still dressed?
JAKE: Well, I want to...
FELICE: Sit down. Make yourself comfortable. My name's Felice.
JAKE: There's a girl I want to ask you about.
FELICE: You're not Vice, are you? Do you work for the Los Angeles Police Department, or do you have any other affiliation with any law enforcement agency?
JAKE: No, I don't.
FELICE: I have to ask you that. If you were Vice you couldn't deny it. You ought to dress less square. You wouldn't get hassled so much. Here, let me help you get that tie off.
JAKE: Well, actually I wanted to ask about this girl. I have her picture here.
FELICE: Pull out your cock.
JAKE: What?
FELICE: Cops aren't allowed to do that either. A judge ruled that that was entrapment. Don't ask me why. I guess he figured the sight of a Vice Officer's dong would make a girl unable to stop herself.
JAKE: No, Felice, I'm not a cop. In fact, right now I've got as little respect for the police as you do. I'm looking for a girl. A runaway. I need someone to help me.
FELICE: Are you going to stiff me?
JAKE: What do you mean?
FELICE: Look, that twenty dollars you just paid, I don't get any of that. That goes to the guys that own this place. I get two bucks an hour, minus ten percent for a bail fund. I make all my money on tips.
JAKE: You want a tip?
FELICE: Sure. What do you want? Tips can be anywhere from thirty dollars to seventy dollars.
JAKE: What do you mean?
FELICE: What do you want to tip me for? Look, you got to spell it out. Whatever you want, just say it.
JAKE: I'll give you a tip. Here's forty dollars.
FELICE: Now, what do you want?
JAKE: I said I just wanted to talk to you...
FELICE: That's cool.
JAKE: ...about this woman. I'm trying to find her. Do you know her?
FELICE: Look, I don't know anybody. I never seen her before.
JAKE: I'm getting angry.
FELICE: Wait a minute, that's going to cost you more than forty bucks.
JAKE: I'm getting angry. I want some answers. Where's the guy who runs this place?
JAKE: Who is it? That blond guy? Where is he? I'm going to talk to someone.
FELICE: Wait?
JAKE: Where is he? Where's the bastard that runs this shit hole?
