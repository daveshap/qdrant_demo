How to fill polygons with patterns in Carto using polygon-pattern-file? I'm trying to create a layer in Carto with three categories of transparent hatching of different colors.I understand how to use the polygon-pattern-file Carto CSS style but am wondering where I can access existing patterns or how to upload my own patterns. It seems like you can't upload .png's to Carto and I can't figure out where else you are supposed to host them in order to get URL's. I can't seem to find any documentation on this.
