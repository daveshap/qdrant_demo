Just curious... What do you really want to know about the girls you date?
Whenever I started dating a guy and they asked me generic questions, I couldn't help but think that they probably care more about knowing other things. I could totally be wrong about that, but I know that there are things I want to know about the guys that I don't ask in the beginning. What do guys really want to know about the girls they are starting to date, that they don't actually ask? Basically, If guys could ask girls anything without fear of being judged, what would it be?
