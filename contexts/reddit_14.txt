How do I make existing worth it?
I feel unmotivated in life right now and I’m not sure if existing is even really worth it. I don’t want to die and disappoint my friends and family, I love my friends dearly. But I’m not satisfied with my life or how it’s looking to turn out. I’m not interested in marrying or having kids. Anyone have any ideas on how to make it all worthwhile?
