My cancer came back.
I was diagnosed with osteosarcoma at 14. I did 9 months of chemo, with a limb sparing surgery in the middle. Less than two years later, I had two thoracotomies to remove metastatic tumors from my lungs and another two a year later to remove more. I then did an experimental treatment but it came back again in the subcutaneous tissue in my abdomen. I was cancer free for about 3.5 years and another tumor was found in my lung last month. I had the surgery again to remove the tumor. 



I am in a ton of pain, and I was told they don't think they got it all. I'm going to have to do radiation in a few weeks. I thought it was all finished with. 3.5 years clear was a huge deal but it seems so small now. 



I have an amazing fianc√© who has stood by me through this most recent surgery. I want to grow old with him, but I don't think that is going to happen. 



We're struggling with money right now because we were fired from our jobs (working at my fathers bar) for having to miss work. His parents have told us not to worry about money during this time, but we also don't know how to ask them for help. A donation page was set up for me and originally got quite a few donations (close to $400) but the donations have stopped coming in. 



I try so hard to be strong for everyone, and everyone thinks I'm okay with it because I've done it before so many times but really that just makes it worse. It's never going to stop, at least not until it kills me. 



I am hurting, broke, sad, and scared. I just needed to share this.
