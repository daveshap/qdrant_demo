Boss fired me unexpectedly through email
Hey guys,

So I worked as a part-time receptionist for a spa for a few months. During the hiring process, I had told the owner that I had a back surgery approaching and need a month off, therefore to please consider that when choosing to hire me. She did, and right off the bat I could tell that she had little to no experience owning a business (puts her personal stress on workers, hires and fires, unprofessional, goes on constant vacations etc.) however, I had no issues as she was rarely in the building. She wished me good luck before I left for surgery and came back exactly a month later.

I worked all of  June 35hrs/wk and was off in May for surgery. I was off last weekend for a mini vacation that was approved before. During my vacation, I had gotten an email that I was terminated for not making enough sales in May and June. Ruined my weekend to say the least, I loved my job and loved my coworkers. 

I am not quite sure about the reasoning, I was off in May and not a single person made enough sales in June. We hardly have enough clients to make payroll, as many of our massage therapists quit due to owner's unprofessional-ism. She has a bad reputation with our local massage school so can't get any new therapists in. I tried my best to sell products and memberships all while leaving notes on the accounts like "offered but declined membership." I never had any arguments or bad relations with anyone, and always voiced concerns face-to-face.   


The choice to fire me is okay, as state law suggests I am an at-will employee, I have no hard feelings. My main question is, is firing through email normal? During a vacation lol? And how can I warn future employees about the workplace experience?
