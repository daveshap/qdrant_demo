For once in my life, I am caught up/ over paid on all of my bills
Due to a mistake in February, I overpaid on my car up to May. I was also able to pay an extra payments worth toward my student loan (which is now under $550). My phone bill is paid until June. I paid off my credit card last month, and though I have put charges on it after, I am able to pay it off now. 

To be honest, I am not quite sure how I got to be in the spot Iâ€™m in right now. It may be because my company gave two bonuses to their employees, and because I have worked extra hours at my second job. Those are the only two logical reasons. But I feel like I am missing something. I feel like at any moment, some ugly bull is going to show its face, and it will all come crashing down.
