Need some advice with a girl I like
So I don’t really know what to do I’m a 16yr old guy and I really like this girl and I would just go for it but her family and mine don’t really mix and I don’t know wether or not I should just go for it and try to work through it cause I know that at our age (she’s 16 aswell) we can’t really not worry about our parents so I don’t know if I should be treating it like I should just value her for her or to think of it as her and her family are a package deal cause I know it’s way too selfish to expect her to forget about her family I also don’t know if she feels the same way
