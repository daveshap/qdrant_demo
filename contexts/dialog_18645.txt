SKIP: I gotta pee. Can I ask you something? This town is called Mumford... Been that way since... 18... 18-0... 18-0... ...thirteen! Right? Now here's the question -- Your name is Mumford, too.
MUMFORD: Is that the question?
SKIP: You moved here from back East and your name is the same as this town. Is that right? Far out.
SKIP: I hope you don't think I want you to do this for free. Just because we're gonna play it like we're friends, doesn't mean I won't pay you like a doctor.
MUMFORD: I understand.
SKIP: I have a lot of money. Do you know how much money I've got?
MUMFORD: Don't tell me, 'cause I'm not going to tell you what I've got.
SKIP: I've got three big ones.
MUMFORD: I'm impressed. I couldn't make three million dollars if I lived three lifetimes.
SKIP: No, no... I have three billion dollars.
