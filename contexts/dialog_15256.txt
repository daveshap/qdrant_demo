TELLY: You think Darcy is gonna be at Nasa tonight?
CASPER: Yeah probably.
CASPER: Yo, you got any weed around here?
TELLY: Naw. But we should run by the park and get a dime. Maybe Darcy will be at the park.
CASPER: Yo. I'm gonna get buff dude.
TELLY: You are?
CASPER: Yeah. The other day, some sort of Chinese bitch told me I'd look good with muscles.
