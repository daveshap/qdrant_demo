TRINITY: What did you just say?
NEO: Nothing. Just had a little deja vu.
TRINITY: What happened? What did you see?
NEO: A black cat went past us and then I saw another that looked just like it.
TRINITY: How much like it? Was it the same cat?
NEO: It might have been. I'm not sure.
NEO: What is it?
TRINITY: A deju vu is usually a glitch in the Matrix. It happens when they change something.
