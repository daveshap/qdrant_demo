MAURICE: Are they standing?
KRIS: Saluting.
KRIS: Come on Mr. Parker.
MAURICE: What, come on?
KRIS: I can't do it. I want you to finish, but I want you to live more.
MAURICE: We do the operation after I finish. I can't risk not finishing... I thought you understood what I was doing.
KRIS: I do.
MAURICE: Why in God's name did you fly all the way here then?
KRIS: Don't do this.
MAURICE: ... To look me in the eye and say what's important to you isn't as important to me? To tell me you know what's best? To tell me life is more precious than what I feel for my wife?
KRIS: Mr. Parker, you can yell at me, if it'll help. But I'm not risking your life.
MAURICE: It's mine to risk.
