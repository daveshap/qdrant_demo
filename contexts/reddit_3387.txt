I don’t understand seeing multiple people at once
(22M) Recently broke it off with a girl because of this. I don’t see the benefit in flirting or dating multiple people at once. When I date I just tend to focus on one person at a time. If the person doesn’t work out I move on until I find the next and so on. To the point where even thinking of flirting with another person seems wrong until I officially stop talking to them. The more that I’m reading about this though it seems to be the norm to be talking to multiple people at once until they become ‘exclusive’ to one. It’s bonkers to me and I honestly don’t get it.
