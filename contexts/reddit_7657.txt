A one year job exp , how useful will it be during admissions ?
My question to former professionals who are pursuing their master's degree. Did your job exp add weight to your application ? ( This is under the pretext that you  worked in the same field like your Master's degree or Phd). If it did add weight , do you wish to add a few more years into your job if given the chance ? And in that context is one year enough or does the duration even matter in general ?
