BELA: Eddie, you got a new movie for me?!
ED: Yeah, it's gonna be a great picture! You'll love your character! Bunny, Bela's here. Look, hit the bars, work some parties, and get me transvestites! <u>I need transvestites</u>!
BELA: Eddie, what kind of movie is this?
ED: Well, It's about how people have two personalities. The side they show to the world, and then the secret person they hide inside.
BELA: Oh, like Jekyll and Hyde! Ah, I've always wanted to play Jekyll and Hyde! I'm looking forward to this production.
ED: Ehh, your part's a little different. You're like the God that looks down on all the characters, and oversees everything.
BELA: I don't understand.
ED: Well... you control everyone's fate. You're like the puppetmaster.
BELA: Ah, so I pull the strings!
ED: Yeah. You pull the strings -- Pull the strings"... hey
