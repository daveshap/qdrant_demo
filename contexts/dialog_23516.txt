WESSEX: Is there a man?
WILL: A man, my lord?
WESSEX: There was a man, poet--a theatre poet, I heard--does he come to the house?
WILL: A theatre poet?
WESSEX: An insolent penny-a-page rogue, Marlowe, he said, Christopher Marlowe--has he been to the house?
WILL: Marlowe? Oh yes, he is the one, lovely waistcoat, shame about the poetry.
WESSEX: That dog!
VIOLA: Your Majesty.
QUEEN: Stand up straight, girl.
QUEEN: I have seen you. You are the one who comes to all the plays--at Whitehall, at Richmond.
VIOLA: Your Majesty.
QUEEN: What do you love so much?
VIOLA: Your Majesty
QUEEN: Speak out! I know who I am. Do you love stories of kings and queens? Feats of arms? Or is it courtly love?
VIOLA: I love theatre. To have stories acted for me by a company of fellows is indeed
QUEEN: They are not acted for you, they are acted for me.
QUEEN: And--?
VIOLA: And I love poetry above all.
QUEEN: Above Lord Wessex?
