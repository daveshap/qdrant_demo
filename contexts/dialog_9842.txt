LT. AMOS: Have a problem, call Ford Fairlane. He won't solve your case, but who cares, you'll be dead in a couple days anyway. Let's face it. After today, the California Raisins aren't gonna hire you.
FORD: That's okay. I'm quitting the music detective business to become a cop killer. Pay's the same, but it'll be much more fun.
LT. AMOS: God, I wish I could prove you killed everybody. Unfortunately, I know who the real killer is.
FORD: Really?
LT. AMOS: It's some psycho killer groupie. I got an anonymous letter that says she killed Bobby Vomit, Johnny Crunch, and now, this society dame.
FORD: Once I got an anonymous letter saying that the world would be destroyed by a giant purple raindrop. I didn't even buy a fucking umbrella... You were in too many discos during the seventies. The Village People rotted your brain.
LT. AMOS: That's the difference between a great investigator like me and a piece of Spam like you. You look at this picture and all you see is beauty. I see the beast.
