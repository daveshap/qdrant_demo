WELLS: ...But that won't last.
MOSS: What is he supposed to be, the ultimate bad-ass?
WELLS: I don't think that's how I would describe him.
MOSS: How would you describe him?
WELLS: I guess I'd say... that he doesn't have a sense of humor. His name is Chigurh.
MOSS: Sugar?
WELLS: Chigurh. Anton Chigurh. You know how he found you?
MOSS: I know how he found me.
WELLS: It's called a transponder.
MOSS: I know what it is. He won't find me again.
WELLS: Not that way.
MOSS: Not any way.
WELLS: Took me about three hours.
MOSS: I been immobile.
WELLS: No. You don't understand.
WELLS: ...What do you do?
MOSS: I'm retired.
WELLS: What did you do?
MOSS: I'm a welder.
WELLS: Acetylene? Mig? Tig?
MOSS: Any of it. If it can be welded I can weld it.
WELLS: Cast iron?
MOSS: Yes.
WELLS: I don't mean braze.
MOSS: I didn't say braze.
WELLS: Pot metal?
MOSS: What did I say?
WELLS: Were you in Nam?
MOSS: Yeah. I was in Nam.
WELLS: So was I.
MOSS: So what does that make me? Your buddy?
WELLS: Look. You need to give me the money. I've got no other reason to protect you.
MOSS: Too late. I spent it -- about a million and a half on whores and whiskey and the rest of it I just sort of blew it in.
