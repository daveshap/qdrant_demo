Split zip into smaller zip files I need weekly to upload bunch of pdf file to grading platform, in the form of zip, but the website has limit of 250Mb per zip file, and it takes me too much time to split the zip I have into smaller zip files.What is the simplest way to split a zip into chunks with max size?A way that would work on other unix-like platform (like my mac at work) will be grate.I'm looking an existing command that will do it, or some simple python (or node, or any other simple to use languages) module that will help we write a small script that does it.
