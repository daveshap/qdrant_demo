Relocation
Hello R/jobs,

I've just received all of my on boarding papers and signed my job offer for a new job in a different state. I can't really pass up on it, as it's a perfect situation and a new fresh career making money I can't make where I'm at.

The problem is that the company does not offer any form of relocation for my position, and will not budge for me. I've done all the negotiating I can, but its done. I don't have the savings anymore, after being unemployed for a few months early last year. I've worked my way up from $10/hr to 18/hr, but haven't managed to really save anything significant. I have a family of 4, and am simply asking if there are any resources out there to help with this whole process.

I am searching for other resources on my own, but I know this sub has been spectacular for advice for many others, so I'm reaching out now.
