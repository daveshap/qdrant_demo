How do I become more charismatic?
I am a 15 year old pubescent boy starting at a new school and I wanna know how to make a good first impression.

I also wanna be more charismatic and be a person that people enjoy being around. Not necessarily being popular, just not unpopular.
Problem is, I'm not really funny. I know I have to be myself, however, I was wondering if there were small details I could do to seem cooler. Maybe also some tips to where I can rest in myself better. Also I'm kind of short, and I've never really minded the jokes, but how can I, for example, use as an advantage?
