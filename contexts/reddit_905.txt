My mother just told me that most people don’t over analyze and obsess over their mistakes made years ago? What is this witchcraft?
So I showed her that meme of the girl lying in bed trying to sleep while her mind decides to suddenly replay her most embarrassing moments. And my mom said “does that actually happen to you?”

And I just... does it not happen to most people? You mean to tell me that most of the world is just putting their mistakes in the past and moving on with their lives? What? How?? 

That sounds so emotionally healthy! Meanwhile multiple times a week I lie awake at night replaying the moments I most wish hadn’t happened.

Edit: Did not know this would resonate with people... also apparently this is a symptom of my OCD!
