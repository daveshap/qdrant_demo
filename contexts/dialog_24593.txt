FIRST HENCHMAN: Say, boss - I been talking to some of the other delegates - and the word is that Little Bonaparte is real sore about what happened to Toothpick Charlie. Him and Charlie, they used to be choir boys together.
SPATS: Stop, or I'll burst out crying.
FIRST HENCHMAN: He even got Charlie's last toothpick - the one from the garage - and had it gold-plated.
SPATS: Like I was telling you - Little Bonaparte is getting soft. He doesn't have it here any more. Used to be like a rock. Too bad. I think it's time for him to retire.
