Advice to stop doing nothing?
I’ve been really struggling these past few weeks to do anything at all, I get out of bed, sit around all day, sometimes eat some sugary snacks, and go back to sleep as soon as I can.. it’s just making me angry at myself at this point but I don’t know how to break the cycle/get motivation to do anything at all

(I’m 20 and a full time student (not a very good one at all) if anyone wants context)
