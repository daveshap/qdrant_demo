Is submitting an application to the same job multiple times bad?
Hello, I'm in the process of applying to internships, and I feel like I might have made a mistake on my application. In reality, I probably didn't, and this is just my anxiety kicking in but I wanted to ask the recruiters and senior-level employees in this subreddit what they thought of someone submitting an application twice. If it isn't a big deal, I'd like to submit all my apps one more time just for sanity sake.
