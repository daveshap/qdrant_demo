ICHABOD: Why did you move the body, Doctor?
DOCTOR LANCASTER: To place it inside its coffin.
BROM: What the hell are you doing?
ICHABOD: You are the blacksmith. Ever shod a horse with a hoof this large?
BROM: Never. A shoe that size I would have remembered.
ICHABOD: Van Ripper. Can you show where the body lay?
VAN RIPPER: I can show exactly.
VAN RIPPER: Here... in front of this oak, facing north. Horrible...
ICHABOD: To the best of your recollection, where did the open wound fall?
ICHABOD: There was not much blood, was there?
VAN RIPPER: I didn't see none.
ICHABOD: No bleeding.
DOCTOR LANCASTER: What is that?
ICHABOD: This should have bled by the pint. Yet, no blistering or scorched flesh. How... ? Whatever weapon was used... it cauterized somehow....
