WHALE: You should have seen Georgie's face when he met Clayton.
DAVID: You didn't, Jimmy.
WHALE: I did. But Princess Margaret was a doll. We're all equals in her eyes. As commoners, I presume.
DAVID: You only embarrass yourself.
WHALE: Oh dear. I'll never work in this town again?
DAVID: You know what I mean. Your reputation.
WHALE: But I have no reputation. I'm as free as the air.
DAVID: Well the rest of us aren't. Can't you remember that?
WHALE: No. I never could. You must regret having had the invitation sent.
DAVID: I didn't ask George to invite you.
WHALE: Then who did?
DAVID: Jimmy, there are people here I need to speak to. You'll be fine on your own?
WHALE: Yes. Perfectly.
DAVID: All right, then. I'll come by tomorrow for breakfast.
