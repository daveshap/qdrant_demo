ROBIN: That's how he died you know.
CHUCK: Who?
ROBIN: My brother. He fell out of the old beech tree. Broke his neck. I was on a camp out. They started going at it, throwin' things, a real knock down... They didn't find him 'till the next morning. They didn't even know why he was up there.
CHUCK: Jesus, you never told them?
ROBIN: I couldn't.
