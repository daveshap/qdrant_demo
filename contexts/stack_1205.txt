How to restore/create linked server logins from one server to another Here is the situation I am in. I have backup files for databases that I am using to restore them on a test server(B). The issue that I am having is that linked server logins appear to be on the master server level and I am unable to use those through a database's backup file.I create these backup files from another server(A) and store them in a remote location. Is there a way to create a file or something with all the linked server logins from server A and use that file to restore them somehow when I use backup files to create Databases on Server B?
