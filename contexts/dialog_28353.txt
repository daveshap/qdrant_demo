HEALY: Look, you asked me to follow your girl around, and I did and I started to like her, and then I realized I just couldn't in good conscience do it.
TED: Do what?
HEALY: Turn her over to a stalker.
TED: What?! You're calling me a stalker?
HEALY: That's right -- if you weren't you would've looked for her yourself!
HEALY: Oh Christ... poor dog.
TED: You're a sick man, you know that?
HEALY: Yeah well fuck you! You just can't stand the fact that it was my turn.
TED: Your turn?
HEALY: That's right, hot shot! My turn. What's the matter with me, huh? Why can't I ever get the great girl? Give the big pig with the B.O. to Healy, right? Well I was sick of it, man! No more -- it was my turn. It was time for me... time for me... to be happy.
TED: Well you didn't have to blow us both out of the water. Jesus Christ, just because she found out about you, why'd you have to take me down with you?
HEALY: I don't know what you're talking about.
TED: I'm talking about the letter, asshole.
HEALY: What?
TED: Are you telling me you didn't send Mary a letter outlining our deal?
HEALY: Why the fuck would I do that? I'd be screwing myself.
HEALY: You little fuck.
TUCKER: What?
HEALY: You fucking prick, we had a deal -- you said you wouldn't fuck me and I wouldn't fuck you until we had this fuck out of the fucking picture. You crossed the line, man.
