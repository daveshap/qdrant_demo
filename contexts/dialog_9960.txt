CREATURE: You were with him at the end.
WALTON: Yes.
CREATURE: I was watching.
CREATURE: I longed to be with him. But I wanted his final moments to have peace. I could see you were a friend to him.
WALTON: What is that to you? Evil as you are.
CREATURE: I am as he made me. In his own image.
WALTON: You drove him to his torment.
CREATURE: And he drove me to mine.
WALTON: Then why weep for him?
CREATURE: Would you not? He was father. And mother. We fell from grace together. He from his God. I from mine.
