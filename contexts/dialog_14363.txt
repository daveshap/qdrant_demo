JACOB: I'd like to speak to Dr. Carlson, please.
RECEPTIONIST: Carlson? Is he new here?
JACOB: New? He's been here for years.
RECEPTIONIST: Not according to my charts. Do you have an appointment?
JACOB: Look, I need to see him. I know where his room is. Just give me a pass. I won't be long. Ten minutes.
RECEPTIONIST: Our doctors are seen by appointment only.
JACOB: Damn it. I was in the veteran's out- patient program. He knows me.
RECEPTIONIST: What's your name?
JACOB: Jacob Singer.
RECEPTIONIST: I'm sorry but there's no record of a Jacob Singer in our files.
JACOB: Whataya mean, no record?
RECEPTIONIST: You want me to spell it out? There's nothing here.
JACOB: That's ridiculous. I've been coming here for years. Listen to me. I'm going out of my fucking mind here. I need to see him.
RECEPTIONIST: If this is an emergency we have a staff of psychiatric social workers. There's about an hour's wait. I'll be glad to take your name. Why don't you just fill out this form?
JACOB: Goddamn it! I don't want a social worker. Carlson knows me.
