CITRINE: You're pushing this too hard. It's like you <u>want</u> me to say <u>stop</u>? You must know that's the way this is going, John? There's other work to do, why don't ya ease off a little?
BERLIN: Coz this is a major & we're closer to this bastard than anyone's ever been.
CITRINE: Then <u>where's the body</u>? .. Where's the body, and <u>why's he hidden it</u>?
BERLIN: He <u>hasn't</u> hidden it. He never made a hit this far north before, and he never read a weather forecast .. She's probably fifteen feet from the highway, three feet under snow.
CITRINE: Have you got a match on the bullet?
BERLIN: No.
CITRINE: Have you got a print from the hand?
BERLIN: No, Sir.
CITRINE: It could be anyone's hand. Illeg- ally disposed of hospital debris ..
BERLIN: It's <u>her</u> hand. <u>Her</u> scars. <u>Her</u> dog. Her dog's shot. And she's missing.
CITRINE: She's <u>not</u> missing." Did she shout? Did she scream? Did he coerce her? <u>No</u>. She left of her own free will .. And if she gets on a plane and goes to Peru with the prick
BERLIN: If you're not gonna hear me, Chief ..
CITRINE: I <u>have</u> heard you. You just don't like hearing <u>me</u>. You got this whole damned thing outta proportion. I don't know what you gotten used to in Los Angeles, but I don't believe there's a Police Chief, <u>in this country</u>, would put a task force together for a body part ..
BERLIN: We have a multiple homicide, Sir ..
CITRINE: We have a body part in suspicious circumstances - a tailor's dummy wearing a brassiere - <u>and a bill</u> <u>for seventeen dollars for its wig</u>!
ROSS: Did he shut you down?
BERLIN: All but .. How <u>you</u> doing?
ROSS: I dunno, I daren't go in there - just about get her wired up, and the fucking mayor walks in - mad as hell - what are we doing fuck- ing with his staff? We should be out chasing major violators ..
BERLIN: I wish he'd tell that to Citrine.
ROSS: Did I say he did?
BERLIN: You looked like you did?
ROSS: No, I think you'll find I looked like he could have? By accident even? He's up here spraying the scenery all day.
BERLIN: He didn't shoot it, Ross. And no way by accident. There's a flash-burn. It was point-blank.
