I don't think people really care until you actually die. And even then they might not care
If I make a post on reddit I usually get ignored.

Even when someone listens to me and responds, they usually ghost me after some time.

If I want to talk to a professional, they are only there because of money, because they know that it's their job and they have to do it because if they don't they won't have money to eat.

No one really cares
