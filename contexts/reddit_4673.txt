I have always been the "supportive" and "strong" friend, but now I'm losing it...
All my life I've tried to do the right thing. I usually give counsel to my closest friends without asking for something in return. I am the strong, the one who never gets sad or has emotional issues. Nevertheless, I am losing it. I am tired of being "strong"; I am tired of appearing "happy" all the time (I do it for them, not because I am in the good mood all the time).  My family does not know it either, but I have to go on with my life for they need me. 

I am tired of loving everybody without receiving a portion of that love. I learned to love my loneliness, but now it feels like I need someone, but finding a partner who wants something serious is extremely hard (and I am not a Greek god, to be honest). I do not like dependency, however, I'd love to have someone to talk to besides my friends. I lost my best friend last year since I fell in love with her (don't do it, worst idea ever). Does anybody feel this way?  Does anyone go through the same thing?
