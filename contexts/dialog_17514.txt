QUINCE: Do you think I should wait to tell him 'till after the party?
JOE: No.
SUSAN: I like you in a black tie.
JOE: I love you in an evening gown.
SUSAN: It beats a surgical, doesn't it?
JOE: Yes. Your father and I, our time together has come to an end.
SUSAN: Where are you going?
JOE: Well -- I --
SUSAN: And you can't tell me who you are.
JOE: I can tell you the when part. Tonight.
SUSAN: It gets worse.
JOE: No worse than it gets for me. I'm in love with a woman whom I don't want to leave.
SUSAN: Then don't.
JOE: We know so little about each other --
SUSAN: We know all that we need to know --
JOE: But there's so much to tell you --
SUSAN: Don't. That will come later.
JOE: Will it?
SUSAN: Lightning struck. We caught it in a bottle. Don't let it out. I want to be with you, Joe --
JOE: What will we do?
SUSAN: 'Love will find out the way'.
JOE: 'Love will find out the way'?
SUSAN: It's a saying.
JOE: I believe that, don't you?
SUSAN: Yes, that's why I said it.
