Degenerate circuit concept and its theoretical and practical implications I came across with the term \"degenerate circuit\" when I was studying solving linear differential equations with Laplace transform. I have learned that a system is called degenerate when the determinant of coefficient matrix (characteristic polynomial) is zero. I've searched a lot to try to understand the concept of \"degenerate circuit\" but I could not fully understand it. Some fragments of what I have searched:Network Theory and Filter Design (Vasudev K. Aatre)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    Electric Circuits And Networks (For Gtu) (Kumar K. S. Suresh)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Linear Circuit Transfer Functions: An Introduction to Fast Analytical Techniques (Christophe P. Basso)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My questions are:What is the definition of \"degenerate circuit\"? (I think Basso's book 1st fragment answered it, but I didn't understand)What are the theoretical implications of a circuit being degenerate, in terms of stability?In \"real life\what does it mean to be degenerate? A degenerate circuit, if built, would not work?
