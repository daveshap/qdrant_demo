On Apple TV, What does signing in with my TV provider and allowing apps to access the subscription actually do? I thought the idea was that i could go into the Apple TV settings app and sign in with my TV provider, so that I would not need to sign into into apps individually. What i find is that even after an app asks for permission to access my TV subscription, I am still required to go to another device, navigate to a URL, and sign in with my TV provider password. Is this working right?
