Bad feeling because I left my friends early on a night out.
Yesterday I (M/19) went to a dinner location with my friends/coworkers/boss. We ate a delicious Menu and after some glasses of wine and 2 liquor we went to a small place where we ordered a Gin Tonic. Everything was fine till that point. Then 2 other people joined the party, my coworkers knew them very well but I didn’t.
So I was sitting in this bar and all of a sudden my 2 friends left the club to go sit outside, which I totally overlooked. So I was left with the 2 other ones not knowing what to do... At that point I called my brother on the phone out of instinct. I went outside in order to hear what my brother was saying and I told him to get me, and ended the phone call. Then on my way inside I noticed my 2 friends sitting outside next to a fireplace. I approached them and said that I’m going to leave. Then my 2 friends started to down talk me like I’m the worst person of the night. Which I probably was... but this whole ‘let’s party and pretend that everything is fine’ is just not my type. Im not like that.
Anyway, my friends then said ‘You need to come with us, it’s gonna be fun!’ 
And my other friend said that’s really uncool from me to go home. 
I said ‘Please don’t be mad with me, but I’m not the right type for that...’
Thy then continued to try to get me to go with them.
‘You’re part of the Team you can’t just leave us, you gotta do the things you don’t like, maybe you’ll enjoy partying a lot’ they said.
I felt really really really bad from that point because I was leaving. I went inside to get my coat and umbrella, went outside again and said good bye to them and they were just ignoring me. Didn’t even say bye to me. Which did hurt me a lot actually.
After I left the place I felt so bad that I repeatedly hit the my umbrella to my head. 
I just felt soooo bad.

Now, I need your guys opinion on that or some advice on what I should have done...
