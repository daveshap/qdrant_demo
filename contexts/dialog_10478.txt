HAMILTON: George, remember that night when we were drinking with Arnold?
WASHINGTON: To hell with Arnold...
HAMILTON: He warned you some day you might have to act for the good of the people -- even if it was against Congress. George, the time has come for you to declare yourself king of America. Listen to me, the whole army would rise up as one and place you on a throne! George, you must declare yourself with us or against us.
WASHINGTON: Is this a coup? Alexander, are you trying to tell me that I might be assassinated if I don't agree?
WASHINGTON: What's your advice, Alexander?
HAMILTON: March on Philadelphia! Get Joseph Reed, and the pigs in Congress, the speculators, who've grown fat off the war! Get them all! Sweep them aside!
WASHINGTON: I want to address the officers, all the officers. Next Friday. Can we arrange it at the mess?
HAMILTON: Yes, I believe so.
WASHINGTON: Well, if it's my last order, then I order them to be there! Tell them I will give them my decision then.
