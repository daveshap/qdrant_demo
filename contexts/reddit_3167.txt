What’s your advice for a 40 year old career changer?
Hello. I’m a newly single mother. I have a BS in psych but I’ve been working call center/customer service for years $15/$17 hourly. I’m newly single and I want a better career: but I’m 40! 

Here’s what I’ve been considering: 


I could get a masters in special education. Building on some experience I have in working with special needs populations the money isn’t so great it it’s a stable job and I have little kids 


I could get a second BS on accounting and become a CPA (stable and good money. But I’m old for this?) 

I could study and be a tax preparer (faster and less competitive than accounting) 


I can stay in call centers and hope that I can pay my bills each month. (I hate this idea) 

What advice have you? 
Any input or suggestion is appreciated
