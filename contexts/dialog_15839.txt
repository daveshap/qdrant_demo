ELLE: All I know is -- it's not Brooke.
DONOVAN: That's touching, Elle, but we need an alibi.
ELLE: I'm here to see Brooke Windham.
GUARD: Licensed attorney or family member?
ELLE: Uh -- family.
GUARD: Relation?
ELLE: I'm her sister.
GUARD: Name?
ELLE: Delta. Gamma.
ELLE: Are you okay? You look so sad... and so orange.
BROOKE: I'm glad it's you and not Donovan.
ELLE: He means well. He's really brilliant and all.
