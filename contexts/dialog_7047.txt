WHITE: I thought it would make more sense. I'm getting the pieces, but when I put it together it feels like... Like you're telling me about somebody else's life...
WIFE: It's the truth... I need you. I know you're innocent.
WHITE: How do you know I'm innocent?
WIFE: Of course you are. You couldn't do those terrible things. Come home with me - maybe things will make sense then...
WHITE: I can't do that. It's dangerous. What about my parents? Do you know where I can find them?
WIFE: They're dead, John.
