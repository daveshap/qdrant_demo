LOUISE: We have to think this through. We have to be smart. Now is not the time to panic. If we panic now, we're done for. Nobody saw it. Nobody knows it was us. We're still okay. Now all we have to do is just figure out our next move.
THELMA: Our next move? I'll say one thing, Louise. This is some vacation. I sure am having a good time. This is real fun.
LOUISE: If you weren't so concerned with having a good time, we wouldn't be here right now.
THELMA: Just what is that supposed to mean?
LOUISE: It means shut up, Thelma.
THELMA: So this is all my fault, is it.
