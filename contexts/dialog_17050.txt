TUBBS: OK, I'm logged on to the municipal network. I'm showing sixteen people with the name Sarah Williams in L.A. county. None of them live in Hollywood. Do you remember the address?
JIM: 1490...Breckinridge...
TUBBS: Let's see what we got...
TUBBS: Donut?
JIM: No thanks. How do you know they can't catch you on this thing?
TUBBS: I don't, but I'm pretty sure. It's a long story but I cloned a cellular linkup with a binary code scrambler and sent it through the phone network mainframe. If they start a trace it will be to a Pic'n'Save on Pico.
JIM: I knew I could count on you.
TUBBS: I got a lot of free time, you know what I mean?
JIM: OK...county tax records...they're saying 1490 Breckinridge is owned by... an Atlantic Trust Corporation...they have a P.O. box in D.C.
JIM: How about Marvosa and the others?
TUBBS: I'll access the LAPD mainframe, but we gotta be careful - that one's kind of tricky -
TUBBS: So...what happened to you, Jimmy? I figure you'd be in some far off place somewhere, living on the edge like the good old days.
JIM: I gave all that up. I got tired of the lies. They wanted to stuff me in Levenworth to cover their asses on a botched assignment. It got so I didn't know who to trust anymore... ...some things never change, I guess.
TUBBS: You know this time, there's nobody that's gonna cover your ass. You're over your head this time.
JIM: What else is new?
