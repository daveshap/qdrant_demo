ADAM: I thought I was here to meet women.
EVE: Not that one!
ADAM: I like her.
EVE: And don't be so obvious!
EVE: What have you ordered?
ADAM: It's a Rob Roy. A very popular drink, I'm told.
ADAM: What about her?
EVE: No way.
ADAM: Why?! I think she's very attractive.
EVE: Adam! She's got bitch written all over her! You do know what bitch" means
ADAM: Yes, I have a dictionary. But I can't understand for the life of me why you would call her that! Or why Cliff would say that about you.
EVE: Because we're bitches! Look at her! Look at the expression on her face! The walk, the jewelry, the fingernails. Please!
ADAM: How 'bout this one?
EVE: Are you kidding?! You wouldn't even be a crumb on her table! You don't see that?!
TROY: Eve?!
EVE: Well, I'm trying to educate him! It's nothing personal.
TROY: Adam, I think for you, we should go for sweet.""
ADAM: Okay. I like that.
EVE: Yeah, sweet. That's a nice way of putting it.
ADAM: What do I say to Miss Sweet when I meet her?
TROY: Um... Eve?
EVE: It's not so much what you say but how you say it. Women like men who are unpredictable.
ADAM: Really?
EVE: Yes, really! Basically, they want what they think they can't have. Same with guys. That's why everybody is walking around here sending off you can't have me" signals!"
ADAM: That's ridiculous.
EVE: Maybe. But that's how it works.
