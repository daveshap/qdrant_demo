GIOVANNI: It's siesta.
KATE: Oh.
GIOVANNI: You see, in America they care for work, they live to work. But in Italy, they care for food, for love, for pleasure...
KATE: How old are you?
GIOVANNI: What do the years matter? I've known you for centuries...
KATE: Hi-iii...
FAITH: Hi. Where've you been?
KATE: Sightseeing... What're you doing?
FAITH: Packing.
KATE: Why?
FAITH: Because I've been kidding myself. Because I realized you were right from the beginning. This whole thing was just a wild goose chase.
KATE: So, you've had a little bad luck.
FAITH: A little bad luck?
KATE: Okay, a lot of bad luck. But that means the odds are probably in your favor now. This is no time to give up.
FAITH: Why do they read kids fairy tales in the first place? Children are very impressionable, you know.
KATE: So you're just quitting? Just like that?
FAITH: I thought you were the one who didn't think I should've come in the first place.
KATE: I know, but...
FAITH: It was a ouija board, remember?
KATE: ...and a fortune teller.
FAITH: Yeah, well, obviously it wasn't meant to be. I've got forty-eight hours. I can still make it home in time to marry Dwayne and try to forget any of this ever happened.
KATE: What about Peter?...
FAITH: Peter? Peter was a mistake. An imposter.
FAITH: The last dead end in a long series of dead ends that I am relieved to finally be leaving behind. May as well start packing, our cab's gonna be here in an hour.
KATE: Who said I was going?
FAITH: What?
KATE: I'm just not ready to go home quite yet, that's all.
