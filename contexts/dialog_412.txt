RICK: I'll tell you later.
KRISTEN: It's no just a house. It's his home. He's waiting there for me...to dream.
RICK: It's okay, babe. We're with you.
KRISTEN: I told you you can't help. This isn't a normal nightmare. I'm doomed.
DAN: I don't get it.
RICK: Let me talk to you.
DAN: So what's up? What'd I miss?
RICK: She told us the story of Freddy. It's a town legend. He was a child killer who was freed on a technicality.
DAN: So?
RICK: It pissed off a lot of parents. According to Kristen, they hunted him down; roasted him alive.
DAN: Nice neighborhood.
RICK: Now it gets weird. She says he comes back in dreams. If he kills you there, you're dead for real.
