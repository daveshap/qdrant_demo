CLAY: What did you expect? Speeches I don't mean?
MARY: I don't expect anything. A minute ago I hadn't cuite waked up.
MARY: I'm awake now. Go on. Say what you want to say. I'll listen.
CLAY: If it's pretty speeches you want, you won't be hearing them. Even when I mean 'em, they don't come easy.
MARY: Save 'em for the girl in gingham. Just tell me I'm not good enough for you. Go on. Say a woman like me can't change.
CLAY: All right -- it's said!
MARY: Then let's get started. The sooner I get to Sonora, the better I'll like it.
HELEN: You're sure there's more where this came from?
FOWLER: Plenty more. And somewhere up there's the lode, the rock rotten with it.
