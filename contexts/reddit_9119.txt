Somebody tried to steal my wife's purse because we were using an ebt card.
So, like most everybody else here, we are poor in basically every common meaning of the word.  It's ok, we have love and close relationships with our kids so we are generally happy.  This past june my daughter save her salary from her part time job for months to buy my wife something really nice for her birthday.  My daughter went out and bought my wife an expensive Michael Kors purse and wallet because: "She always sacrificed for us to have what we needed, often going without for herself or giving up things she already had." in my daughters own words.  My wife cried when opening the gift and cherishes that purse and what it meant to her from her daughter.

So, yesterday while grocery shopping the lady behind her spotted the ebt card and the purse it just came out of.  She made a big scene and tried to take my wife's purse because "poor people don't deserve expensive purses."  This failed spectacularly because my wife will always buckle her purse to the cart to prevent theft.  When the buckle was pulled tight the momentum the lady had started made her sprawl out on the floor.  So she just sat there shaming my wife before getting up and leaving.  Security was slow to respond and did basically nothing because no theft had actually occurred.

So now, my wife is ashamed to enjoy this gift from her daughter and wants to get rid of it.  It would be safe to say I'm more than a little bit pissed that a stranger took away one of the few things my wife has had that was just for her.

**TLDR:** A stranger misjudged our situation and proceeded to shame and attempt steal my wifes things because "poor people don't deserve nice things."
