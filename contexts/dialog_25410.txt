SULU: This is Captain Sulu, USS Excelsior.
KIRK: Sulu!
SULU: Standing by, Captain Kirk.
KIRK: You understand that by even talking to us, you're violating regulations, Captain.
SULU: I'm sorry, Captain - your message is breaking up.
KIRK: Bless you, Sulu. Where's the peace conference? They're going to attempt another assassination.
SULU: The Conference is at Camp Khitomer, near the Romulan border. I'm sending the exact coordinates on a coded frequency.
KIRK: I'm afraid we may need more than that. There's a Bird of Prey on the lookout for us. And she can fire while she's cloaked.
SULU: Surely not.
KIRK: I'm telling you. Hang on. How many of those things are there? Come on, Lieutenant, you're charged with murder...
LT. SAAVIK: Just the prototype.
KIRK: You hear that?
SULU: I'm getting underway now. But you should know, I'm in alpha Quadrant. The chances of my reaching the conference in time are slim.
KIRK: When does this conference start?
SULU: According to my information, today.
KIRK: Thank you, Captain Sulu.
SULU: Don't mention it, Captain Kirk.
