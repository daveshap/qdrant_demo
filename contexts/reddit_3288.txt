Is it bad that I'm about to screw over my boss by denying a promotion he's worked really hard for me to get to join another company?
Hello! I haven't been happy at my job for a while now. I could list the reasons why but I'll just add a couple: Low team morale, flawed product, substantial work limitations. The one thing I love about my job, however, is my manager. He cares about his team, is extremely dedicated to making us happy and to get the team working well. He knows I've wanted out for a few weeks, I would never admit, but about 4 people on our team left the company so he's pretty stressed, and broke the news that I wanted to join a different team in the organization. Instead of getting mad, he put in a good word for me and got me an interview (it'd be a promotion technically, just in a different department).

I had the interview and I kind of nailed it, and they said they wanted me to join but will have to go over logistics on when I can join. My manager kept me hired, has been treating me like this hasn't even happened and has patiently been waiting for them to make the offer. He is a gem.

Unbeknownst to him, I've been applying elsewhere for work because I like to have my options open. A job that I would love has shown extreme interest and I'm in my final rounds of interviews tomorrow. I don't have it yet, but there's a chance I will get this offer, and the internal offer at about the same time and I can't help but feel like I'd be screwing over my current boss and the potential new boss if I was to say yes to this other job because they've both put time and effort into securing my position with this internal promotion. Should I feel guilty or is this ok?
