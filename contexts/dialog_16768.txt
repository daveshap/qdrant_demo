DR. LANDON: This is the number for Hospice. Ok. Now. As far as the morphine pills go, there is something else to consider that can take the pain away that he is in, there is a very strong and very potent solution of liquid morphine....it's a little bottle, with an eye dropper and it's easy to get in his mouth and drop on his tounge and it will certainly diminish the pain that he is in but you have to realize that once you give it to him; there really is no coming back, I mean, it will certainly cure his pain, but he will float in and out of consciousness, even worse than he is now, Linda. I mean, any sign of the recognizable Earl will pretty much go away --
LINDA: -- how the fuck can I say anything to that -- I don't know what to say to that --
DR. LANDON: The job here is to make him as comfortable as possible -- right now -- our job is to just try and make it as painless as possible. Right? You understand?
