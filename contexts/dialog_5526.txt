MAGUIRE: Shut up, Jude. You best get some sleep tonight, Fergus.
FERGUS: Peter.
MAGUIRE: What?
FERGUS: Request permission to guard the prisoner tonight --
JUDE: You're crazy. Don't let him, Peter.
MAGUIRE: Shut the fuck up, Jude.
MAGUIRE: Why do you want to do that for?
FERGUS: Would make me feel better about it.
MAGUIRE: You sure about that?
FERGUS: I'm sure.
MAGUIRE: Okay. You're a good man, Fergus.
FERGUS: Don't.
JODY: I'm sorry.
JODY: Help me.
FERGUS: How can I?
JODY: I don't know. Just help me. Give me a cigarette.
