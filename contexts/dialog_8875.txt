FRANK: Listen ... why don't you come out to the house this weekend. Say hello to the kids. They've grown.
JACK: I hate your kids, Frank.
FRANK: You're their uncle.
JACK: Only by relation. Besides, they hate me, too.
FRANK: They don't. They're always asking about you.
JACK: They tried to electrocute me, Frank.
FRANK: It was an accident.
JACK: It was no fucking accident, Frank. The little one ...
FRANK: Cindy.
JACK: She threw a goddamn radio into the bathtub. How do you explain that?
FRANK: She didn't know what she was doing. You're too sensitive.
JACK: You got weird kids, Frank.
FRANK: Look, I just thought if you came out you might see what you're missing.
