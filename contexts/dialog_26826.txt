DICKIE: Good afternoon!
RIPLEY: What time is it? Oh God! Do you always type your letters? That should be two Ts.
DICKIE: I can't write and I can't spell. That's the privilege of a first-class education. You're upstairs at the back. I think Ermelinda made the bed up.
RIPLEY: This is so good of you.
DICKIE: Don't say it again. Now you're a Double Agent and we're going to string my Dad along, I was thinking we might buy a little car with the expense money he's sending you. What do you think, Marge... a little Cinquecento with my Dad's money?
MARGE: Dickie, you can't even drive a car! No, what we need urgently is an icebox. What do you think, Tom? Agree with me and I'll be your friend for life.
RIPLEY: I absolutely agree with Marge.
DICKIE: It'll just be for a little while. He can be... he makes me laugh.
MARGE: Okay, darling.
DICKIE: You'd say if you mind?
MARGE: No, I like him.
DICKIE: Marge, you like everybody.
MARGE: I don't like you.
DICKIE: Then I'll go to your place and you can move in with Tom.
DICKIE: Now you know why Miss Sherwood always shows up for breakfast. It's not love it's the coffee machine.
MARGE: It's the one task Dickie can do on his own -- make coffee.
DICKIE: Shut up.
MARGE: Oh darling -- is that for me?
DICKIE: No it's for Tom as he didn't complain.
RIPLEY: That ring's so great. The green one.
MARGE: Tom, I love you! See! I bought it for him, for his birthday.
RIPLEY: It's superb.
DICKIE: I had to promise, capital P, never to take it off -- otherwise I'd give it to you.
MARGE: Bastard! Isn't it great, Tom? I found it in Naples. I bargained for about two weeks.
DICKIE: I hope it wasn't cheap.
MARGE: Oh, it was.
RIPLEY: I have to find a birthday present for Frances. Perhaps you can help me?
MARGE: Frances?
RIPLEY: My fianc√©e.
DICKIE: You're a dark horse, Ripley. Engaged?
RIPLEY: Your parents met her.
DICKIE: Oh God -- I can just imagine -- if only Dickie would settle down... doesn't every parent deserve a grandchild? Never! I swear on your ring, Marge. I am never going back.
RIPLEY: I'm doing this wrong, aren't I?
DICKIE: You're doing great. We'll make a sailor of you yet. You're doing really well.
MARGE: Dubious but special honor, Tom -- crewing Dickie's boat. Alright, bar's open.
DICKIE: Yes please!
RIPLEY: Could we sail to Venice?
DICKIE: Sure. I love Venice.
RIPLEY: I have to go to Venice.
DICKIE: See Venice and die, isn't that right? Or is it Rome? You do something and die, don't you? Okay, Venice is on the list.
RIPLEY: And Rome.
DICKIE: Do you ski? Don't tell me -- you're a lost cause! That's the next thing to deal with. We're planning to go to Cortina at Christmas. Excellent skiing. Excellent. Marge -- Ripley can't ski. We'll have to teach him that, too. Have you ever known such low class?
