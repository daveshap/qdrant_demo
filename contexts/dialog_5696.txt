KENNY: All our parents are weirdoes. I think my dad is into hookers. I know he lit cats on fire when he was a kid.
JODY: My dad acts like he's Johnny Fucking Perfect and he's really Johnny Fucking Rapist.
KENNY: I think this is a big part of growing up. It's losing your spiritual virginity. It's when you finally discover that your parents aren't anything they told you they were. They're even bigger hypocrites than your friends.
JODY: I can't believe I listened to one word of his shit.
KENNY: But if he'd been sent to jail, there would be no Jody.
JODY: So I should feel happy that he got away with it?
KENNY: I don't know. I kind of am.
KENNY: Are you coming to the party?
JODY: Let's just start a party right here, right fucking now.
