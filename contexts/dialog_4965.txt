WALTER: A show?! Like this Sunday?
LEONARD: N-no! Not exactly, I mean you take years and years...
LEONARD: It will take years to make that many statues. But your work would be featured.
CARLA: That's the idea, Walter. It's the only way to gain recognition. All the big art critics and art dealers would be there, it would be an event.
LEONARD: Yeah then you could unload - sell this stuff for a lot more.
WALTER: A show..how soon can we go?
LEONARD: These things take time Walter... but for now you've got to break out of this one...avenue you're on...
LEONARD: Carla and I will guide you, help develop and evolve your work...maybe lead you toward something more abstract...
CARLA: Abstract? With his talent for realism?
LEONARD: You see the direction his realism takes! It's unhealthy!
