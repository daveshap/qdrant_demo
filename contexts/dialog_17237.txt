LIEUTENANT DISH: I couldn't have slept tonight anyhow.
HAWKEYE: You're leaving tomorrow?
LIEUTENANT DISH: In less than twelve hours I'll be on my way.
HAWKEYE: That's when the real strain starts. Three weeks on a troopship. Poor baby.
LIEUTENANT DISH: Dear, sweet Hawkeye.
HAWKEYE: Though I guess who it'll really be rough on is your husband.
LIEUTENANT DISH: You're on his side all of the sudden?
HAWKEYE: A man would be more considerate. He wouldn't come home to his wife a nervous wreck.
LIEUTENANT DISH: How would he avoid it... as if I needed to ask?
HAWKEYE: It could be a purely impersonal thing. What matters is the therapeutic value of relieving your tensions.
LIEUTENANT DISH: You should have been a marriage counselor. But I'll show you what's wrong with your theory.
LIEUTENANT DISH: Do you think anything between us could be impersonal? Or pure? You better forget logic, because you're proving why I shouldn't go to bed with you.
HAWKEYE: I didn't mean with me.
LIEUTENANT DISH: You're asking for somebody else?
HAWKEYE: It happens to be a matter of life and death.
LIEUTENANT DISH: A man is going to die if he doesn't have my fair young body?
HAWKEYE: Precisely, Maria. Tonight you have the same privilege that comes on rare occasions to the chief executive of some state or nation... the privilege of restoring life, by one tender act of mercy, to a doomed fellow creature.
HAWKEYE: He should come to now for a while, but he's got so much dope in him by tomorrow he won't know fact from fantasy.
LIEUTENANT DISH: You think he won't.
HAWKEYE: What do you care? You'll be on your way to Japan.
LIEUTENANT DISH: I'm fond of Painless, and I'd feel terrible if anything happened to him...
HAWKEYE: It's your decision, Maria. I don't want to high-pressure you.
LIEUTENANT DISH: I'd be crazy to think my virtue, such as it is, was more important than his life...
HAWKEYE: In fact I'd rather not try to influence you at all. Let's just go in and take a look, and then you think it through for yourself.
