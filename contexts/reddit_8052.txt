Funding in foreign countries
I’m a second year student of a bachelor program in physics in Italy so there will be much time for me to think where to apply.

However I’d like to understand better how things work for graduate students: how do you apply for a graduate course in foreign countries? What requirements do you need? How does funding work?

I did some research but it’s still not completely clear to me.

To be more specific, let’s pick Caltech and Cambridge as examples: what are the main differences between the two for a PhD in physic?

If you have experience of other universities those are also welcome.

Thanks in advance
