Ever jump to the thought of suicide over minor inconveniences?
I can’t be the only one I’m sure. Any minor inconvenience; a mistake I made, getting yelled at by parents, beating myself up over things that are out of my control even.

My mind just automatically goes to death in those cases. I guess I’ve gotten so used to considering it an option and thinking about it multiples times a day, that when any inconvenience happens, my mind jumps to “you should kill yourself” right away. 

Thing is, when I try to talk to, say, my best friend about it, he listens and then responds with “how can you think these things?” I’m made to feel as though it’s my fault for jumping to the idea of death so easily and thinking the things I do.

 I feel invalidated when I talk about those thoughts to him, especially if the reason is something small. I usually also get shut down immediately with “that’s not you that’s thinking these things, it’s the thoughts” or “that’s not what you want”, or better yet, “that’s dumb/stupid.”

Edit: Maybe it’s because the idea of suicide brings me peace and calms me down in overwhelming situations. I know that if I kill myself, all my problems will go away and I won’t have to be worried about anything anymore. It’s probably weird to say the idea of killing myself makes me happy or brings me peace but it literally does somehow.
