MICKEY: So, so, but it was when I was younger, so--
DR. ABEL: You know, I saw your father this week about his sinus...
MICKEY: Mm-hm.
DR. ABEL: ...and, uh, he complained of chest pains.
MICKEY: Well, this guy's the real hypochondriac of the family. I mean, he's, you know, he's--
DR. ABEL: You mentioned on the phone that you'd had some dizziness.
MICKEY: Yes, a little dizziness, and I think, I think I'm developing a hearing loss in my right ear ...or my left ear, my, my left...oh, n-n-n-no. No, I'm sorry. It was my right, my right, my right or my left ear.
MICKEY: Now I ca-can't remember.
DR. ABEL: Let's take a look.
DR. ABEL: Well, I'm sorry to say you have had a significant drop in the high- decibel range of your right ear.
MICKEY: Really?!
DR. ABEL: Have you been exposed to a loud noise recently, or did you have a virus?
MICKEY: No, I-I've been perfectly healthy. You know me.
MICKEY: I always, I-I always imagine that I have things.
DR. ABEL: When did you first notice this?
MICKEY: Oh, uh, about a month ago. Wha- what do I have?
DR. ABEL: You've had some dizzy spells. What about ringing and buzzing? Have you, uh, noticed any of that?
MICKEY: Yes, now-now that you mention it, uh, I-I-I have, uh, buzzing and also ringing. Ringing and buzzing. Um, am I going deaf, or something?
DR. ABEL: And it's just in one ear?
MICKEY: Yes, is it, is it, uh, healthier to have problems in both ears?
DR. ABEL: What I'd like to do, is to make an appointment for you at the hospital. I'd like to have them run some tests.
MICKEY: The hospital? What kind of tests?
DR. ABEL: Now, don't get alarmed. These are just more sophisticated audiometry tests than I can run here. I mean, it's, it's nothing.
MICKEY: Well, if it's nothing, then why do I have to go into the hospital at all? I mean, uh, I hear perfectly fine, so I'm, so I'm a little weak on the, on the high decibels. So I, you know, I won't go to the opera.
DR. ABEL: You know, there's no reason for panic. I just want to rule out some things.
MICKEY: Like what?
DR. ABEL: It's nothing. Will you trust me?
