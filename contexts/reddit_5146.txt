2 months and 3 interviews later and I get turned down for a job offer.
Small private company in oil and gas, first I had a phone interview, was then flown out by them to Houston for a face to face, and finally a video conference interview.  10 days after the video interview (today) I was notified that unfortunately they were going to continue their search.  

The thing that really burns my ass is that I had called and spoke to their hr person yesterday and she voluntarily told me how much everyone had liked me in my final interview, “no one had anything bad to say and enjoyed how personable you were.”  Needless to say finding out today that I was turned down for the position really caught me off guard, especially after such positive reinforcement from one of the employees that was involved in the final interview. 

Guess it just goes to show you it doesn’t matter how much the position seems “in the bag” you never truly know until you get the offer letter.  Anyone else ever gone through something similar?  Guess it’s time to dust myself off and try to find another opportunity, job hunting shouldn’t be this difficult.
