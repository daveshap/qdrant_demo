PENDERGAST: Dr. Green...
MARGO: I didn't imagine it. I know what I saw. Are you sure there are enough men in there?
PENDERGAST: They're all heavily armed.
MARGO: All right. This is hard for me. I'm a scientist. I like order and logic. Sometimes too much. There's got to be an explanation. There can't be an animal in there. But I saw something.
PENDERGAST: What was it?
MARGO: I don't know. Mr. Pendergast. Do me a favor. Get me a DNA readout on that claw.
