DC block capacitor choosing with 50 Ohms input impedance I need block DC in a 50 Ohms terninated system. The passband will go from 100Hz to 100MHz, so the needed capacitance is around hundreds of uFs. For normal chip capacitors, I think I must take the ESL into consideration. Are there any good methods to achieve a flat passband as wide as this? Or there are some special capacitors can handle this? Any suggestions are appreciated.
