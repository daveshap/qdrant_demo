ERIC: I'll go into town with you.
ANNE MARIE: Eric, leave it alone. It's not your business.
ERIC: No way can he get away with this. I'll be back by tonight.
ERIC: Ben Corbett?
CORBETT: Yep. Afraid you have me at a disadvantage.
ERIC: Kenai at the general store asked me to bring these. Didn't expect we'd already met.
CORBETT: No big deal. We just got off on the wrong foot. What's your name?
ERIC: Desmond.
CORBETT: New to the country, kid?
ERIC: Six months. Ecological study for Northland Oil.
CORBETT: Ecology. Folks use that term for everything but what it means: who's eating who.

CORBETT: Now, why don't you get around to saying what you want.
CORBETT: You wouldn't shoot anyone...
WILDER: But I would.
CORBETT: All this for laying traps on private land?
WILDER: You left a footprint at the Sportsmen's camp. Only pretty sight there, Ben, 'cause the two men you didn't shoot and mutilate died of exposure.
CORBETT: Christ if I shouldn't know better than to step in soft earth. I've seen footprints in the tundra a hundred years old.
WILDER: I got it from here. Thanks.
CORBETT: Sam, give Dixie here fifty bucks out of my kit, will you?
