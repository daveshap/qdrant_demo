TOMMY: I hate to say I told you, but I did. I told you don't start nothing with him that time.
CHILI: You said don't say nothing and I didn't.
TOMMY: No, you just broke his fuckin' nose instead.
CHILI: You gonna start that again? You're just like him, all you got room for in your brain is one fuckin' thing.
TOMMY: All I know is he came by the barber shop, all fuckin' undone, wanting to know where you were staying in Vegas. I told him I don't know. I still don't.
CHILI: How'd he know I was in Vegas? You tell him?
TOMMY: He already knew it.
CHILI: Yeah, well, I'm in L.A. now.
TOMMY: Whatta you doing out there?
CHILI: I'm going into the movie business.
TOMMY: What're you talking about? You wanna be a movie star?
CHILI: I'm thinking about producing.
TOMMY: How you gonna do that? You don't know shit about making movies.
CHILI: I don't think the producer has to do much, outside of maybe knowing a writer.
TOMMY: Hey, Chil? I think you're fulla shit.
