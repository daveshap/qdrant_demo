VANDERHOF: Dear Mr. MacIntosh -- Vanderhof, Public Relations. Oh, yes, Baxter. Just a minute. All right, Miss Finch -- type up what we got so far. Now what is it, Baxter?
BUD: Look, Mr. Vanderhof -- I've got you down here for tonight -- but I'm going to be using the place myself -- so I'll have to cancel.
VANDERHOF: Cancel? But it's her birthday -- I already ordered the cake --
BUD: I hate to disappoint you -- I mean, many happy returns -- but not tonight --
VANDERHOF: That's not like you, Baxter. Just the other day, at the staff meeting, I was telling Mr. Sheldrake what a reliable man you were.
BUD: Thank you, Mr. Vanderhof. But I'm sick -- I have this terrible cold -- and a fever -- and I got to go to bed right after work.
VANDERHOF: Buddy-boy, that's the worst thing you can do. If you got a cold, you should go to a Turkish bath -- spend the night there -- sweat it out --
BUD: Oh, no. I'd get pneumonia -- and if I got pneumonia, I'd be in bed for a month -- and if I were in bed for a month --
VANDERHOF: Okay, you made your point. We'll just have to do it next Wednesday -- that's the only night of the week I can get away.
BUD: Wednesday -- Wednesday -- I got somebody penciled in -- let me see what I can do -- I'll get back to you.
