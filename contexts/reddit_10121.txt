SURVEY for College Students: The Student Telos: Exploring Perceptions of Higher Education
Dear all, my name is Zach Rausch, and I am a MA Psychology student at SUNY New Paltz.

Are you interested in the psychology of the college experience? Come join this extensive national survey exploring the attitudes held by university/college students across the United States. We are looking for students across all levels of higher education (e.g., associates, bachelors, masters, Phd, etc.). For this survey, you must be 18 years or older to complete.

So please participate in this BRIEF 15 minute survey. Participants will be asked general questions and will always have the opportunity to quit the survey whenever they please. Your help would be greatly appreciated!
