WEAVER: Get real, Z! She just dropped the scarf by accident!
Z: Are you kidding? There were sparks between us! This scarf is a sign!
WEAVER: It's a sign that you're crazy! Do you know what the penalty for impersonating a soldier is?
Z: What's gonna go wrong?! I take your place for the royal inspection. Bala comes strolling down the line, she sees me -- <u>bingo</u>! Love is rekindled, and she takes me up to the palace for a little... tea and crumpets... and you take your place again, and go march around to your heart's content!
Z: You have to help me. Please, Weaver. Think of all the things I've done for you!
WEAVER: I can't think of any.
Z: Well I'm gonna <u>start</u> doing things for you...
WEAVER: Will you introduce me to some worker girls?
Z: You bet! They'll really go for a sensitive guy like you!
WEAVER: Maybe I'll get lucky. You know, Z, I wouldn't do this for anyone but you...
WEAVER: Wear this.
Z: You're a real buddy.
WEAVER: Yeah, I know.
Z: What do I do?
WEAVER: Don't tell anyone you're a worker. Follow that column over there. And come right back after the inspection!
