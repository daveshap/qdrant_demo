Is MBA or MPA best for federal job opportunities?
I should be finishing my BSEE next summer and was wondering which degree opens more doors with federal jobs. Trying to get a GS-9 at a minimum after retiring from the USAF. I was thinking of MBA, but if MPA opens more doors then I'll go that route instead. I'm just not sure.

I'm really only looking for federal jobs. Relocation most anywhere in the US..
