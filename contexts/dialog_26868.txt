DOUGH-BOY: Yeah. We went to Harvard together.
WIZARD: We call him Dough-Boy cause he likes the dollars. He'll chase a buck straight into Jersey.
DOUGH-BOY: Look who's talking? Who else would stay up all night to catch the morning rush hour?
WIZARD: So howsit?
TRAVIS: Some fleet driver for Bell just got cut up. Just heard it on the radio.
DOUGH-BOY: Stick up?
TRAVIS: No, just some crazy fucker. Cut half his ear off.
DOUGH-BOY: Where.
TRAVIS: In the jungle. 122nd.
DOUGH-BOY: You run all over town, don't you, Travis?
WIZARD: Fuckin' Mau Mau land, that's what it is.
TRAVIS: Huh?
DOUGH-BOY: I mean, you handle some pretty rough traffic, huh?
TRAVIS: I have.
DOUGH-BOY: You carry a piece? You need one?
TRAVIS: Nah. I suppose not.
DOUGH-BOY: Well, you ever need one, I know a feller that kin getcha a real nice deal. Lotsa shit around.
WIZARD: The cops and company raise hell they find out.
DOUGH-BOY: Truck drivers bring up Harlem Specials that blow up in your hand. But this guy don't deal no shit. Just quality. If you ever need anything, I can put you in touch.
WIZARD: For a fee.
DOUGH-BOY: For a fee.
WIZARD: I never use mine. But it's a good thing to have. Just as a threat.
DOUGH-BOY: Well, if there's this many hackies inside, there must be lots of fares outside. And I'm gonna hustle 'em.
WIZARD: What ya gonna do with all that money, Dough-Boy?
DOUGH-BOY: Support my kids. Can you dig it? Nice to meet ya, Travis. So long, Wizard. Say hello to Malcolm X for me.
BETSY: Try holding the match like this.
TOM: This is gotta be a game, right?
BETSY: This I gotta see.
TOM: Ouch!
BETSY: Oh, are you all right?
TOM: I'm great. Always set my fingers on fire. If you want to see another trick. I do this thing with my nose.
BETSY: No. I just wanted to see if you could light it that way. The guy at the newsstand can.
TOM: Ah, yes, the guy at the newsstand, Mr. Asbestos...
BETSY: He happens to be missing fingers. I first noticed when --
TOM: Is he Italian?
BETSY: No, why?
TOM: You sure he's not Italian?
BETSY: He's Black, OK?
TOM: Well, If he had been Italian, they could have been shot off. Sometimes the mob does that to teach guys a lesson, If they blow a job or something.
BETSY: As I said, he isn't Italian. Besides, I thought they just killed them.
TOM: Don't be naive. They can't kill everybody. They have different punishments for different things. Like, if they kill a stool pigeon, they leave a canary on the body. It's symbolic.
BETSY: Why don't they leave a pigeon instead of a canary?
TOM: I don't know. Maybe they don't leave a canary. Don't be technical. What I'm saying is if this newsstand guy's Italian and his fingers are gone, maybe he's a thief.
BETSY: First, he's not Italian. Second he's not a thief. I noticed the fingers when he was getting my change -- the right change. Two of his fingers are missing. Just stubs. Like they were blown away. I was putting my change in my purse when I saw him get out a cigarette. I couldn't help watching. I was dying to see how he'd light it.
TOM: With the other hand, right?
BETSY: No, stupid. With the stubs. That's the whole point.
TOM: I know that guy. His hand looks like a paw. An old Black guy, the newsstand at --
BETSY: No, this is young -- well, I'm never sure how old Black people are -- but, anyway, he isn't old. That's for sure.
TOM: Show me how he did that again.
