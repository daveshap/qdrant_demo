BARBOSSA: You have a name, missy?
ELIZABETH: Elizabeth -- Turner. I'm a maid in the governor's household.
BARBOSSA: You've got sand, for a maid.
ELIZABETH: Thank you, sir.
BARBOSSA: And how does a maid come to own a trinket such as that? A family heirloom, perhaps?
ELIZABETH: Of course. I didn't steal it, if that's what you mean.
BARBOSSA: No, no, nothing like that. Very well. You hand that over, we'll put your town to our rudder and ne'er return.
ELIZABETH: Can I trust you?
BARBOSSA: It's you who invoked the parlay! Believe me, Miss, you'd best hand it over, now ... or these be the last friendly words you'll hear!
