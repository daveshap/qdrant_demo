Starting Wendy’s Today
I’m starting today in about 7 hours. Any advice from current/former Wendy’s employees before I go? I’m 18 years old and it’s only my second job, my first job was for a month, so not long. What should I expect?

Update: sorry for taking so long. The job is great, at first I was VERY nervous, but now, it’s great. Everyone’s nice to each other, and I even get to make my own meals for home before closing. The only thing bothering me are my feet, after 9+ hours of working, my feet KILL me at the end of my shift. I hate it. Other than that, it’s great. I appreciate all of the help before I started! It really helped me out! Ask me any questions about it if you’d like. I’ll happily answer!
