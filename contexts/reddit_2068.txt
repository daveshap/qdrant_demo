Fu*ck you Lehigh. You are an asshole.
I called Lehigh after that incident (https://www.reddit.com/r/ApplyingToCollege/comments/ed4jff/what_the_fuk_lehigh_how_can_you_do_this/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share). The admission office told me that they were sorry. I elaborated them my situation and how hard it has been for me now. 

The lady noted my phone number and said that I will soon get a call from someone at Lehigh. The time was around ( 8:30 am in Lehigh). I waited for the call for 3 hours but got no response. I called them again, and she said that the respective official is in the different call. "Oh, okay", I said.

Then I called them, again and again, and she said the same thing. I called them again, and again the same thing. And slowly they didn't even receive the call 

I made my last call at 4:45 pm in Lehigh. I didn't sleep for the whole night. I repeatedly made call for "8" hours. Now when I call again, and it says that business hours are over and to make a call on Monday. 

So they played with me? I will never forgive them for this and will not call them again. I pray for their demise. Such an asshole institution. 

P.S: Thanks to all A2C member who consoled me in a hard time. Now I'll not look back at that fucking college. I'll move on. Thank you. Thank you so much.

Edit: They called me by themselves just now and said that they are ready to offer me any help and i should look forward apply to other colleges. They were ready to provide me admission but since financial aid budget is out, they couldn't. And if i could pay the full cost now, they will accept me. 

And I'll obviously not pay anything more than my previous EFC. Looking forward now. Thanks guys.
