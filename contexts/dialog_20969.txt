LUCIUS: They think you're behaving foolishly. I must say I agree. Where will you go?
TAYLOR: I'll start by following the shoreline. And my nose.
ZIRA: But suppose you find nothing but a wasteland. How will you survive?
ZAIUS: He won't survive. Do you know what sort of life awaits you out there, Taylor? That of an animal. If you aren't eventually hunted down and killed by apes, some jungle beast will devour you.
TAYLOR: Then there is another jungle?
ZAIUS: Of course, you could return with us. Our society might find a place for you and your mate.
TAYLOR: Sure.	In a cage.
ZAIUS: Where else, but in a cage, does man belong?
TAYLOR: No, thanks. I'll take freedom.
TAYLOR: Would you like to come along?
ZIRA: We can't.
TAYLOR: It's better than going to prison for heresy.
CORNELIUS: They can't convict us of that. You proved our innocence. Besides... ... his culture is our culture.
TAYLOR: Good luck then.
TAYLOR: Dr. Zira, I'd like to kiss you good-bye.
ZIRA: All right, but.... ...you're so damned ugly!
ZIRA: Go with God, Taylor. That's an old expression. it comes from both ape and man.
TAYLOR: God bless you.
TAYLOR: Lucius.
LUCIUS: I think you're making a mistake.
TAYLOR: That's the boy. Keep 'em flying.
LUCIUS: What?
TAYLOR: The flags of discontent. It's the only way anything ever gets changed. Don't try to follow us. I'm pretty handy with things like this.
