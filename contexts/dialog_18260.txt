RONNY: It's wood. It's fake. Five years ago I was engaged to be married. Johnny came in here, he ordered bread from me. I put it in the slicer and I talked with him and my hand got caught cause I wasn't paying attention. The slicer chewed off my hand. It's funny 'cause - when my fianc√© saw that I was maimed, she left me for another man.
LORETTA: That's the bad blood between you and Johnny?
RONNY: That's it.
LORETTA: But that wasn't Johnny's fault.
RONNY: I don't care! I ain't no freakin monument to justice! I lost my hand, I lost my bride! Johnny has his hand, Johnny has his bride! You come in here and you want me to put away my heartbreak and forget?
