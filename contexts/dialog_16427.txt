HARRY: You believe that?
VINOVICH: I think we walk a narrow path, between... between...
HARRY: Heaven and Hell?
VINOVICH: Trickery and divinity.
HARRY: Are you saying that sometimes the miracles are real?
VINOVICH: No. I'm saying they were always fake. The saints, the messiahs, they were just illusionists.
HARRY: So could you walk on water?
VINOVICH: I could reproduce any miracle that's ever been performed, with a little preparation.
HARRY: What about Swann's miracles?
VINOVICH: They weren't worth a damn.
HARRY: I heard he was the best.
VINOVICH: If he was so good why's he so dead?
HARRY: You tell me. No? I thought you'd maybe have a theory.
VINOVICH: Oh, I've got plenty.
HARRY: I'd like to hear them.
VINOVICH: I'm not saying another word. You damn fool. He's a journalist.
HARRY: Just tell me about Swann. Or are you too scared?
VINOVICH: He was a freak. Everything he did was tainted.
HARRY: With what?
VINOVICH: Evil. He was evil. Come on.
