DULANEY: What are they saying?
MICHAEL: The kids at school say she humped Mr. Marsh to death.
DULANEY: Hey, you know better than that. What did I teach you to say when someone is accused of doing something?
MICHAEL: She allegedly humped him to death?
SHARON: I swear -- the both of you. Some example you set.
DULANEY: Some example you set.
DULANEY: Andrew Marsh was a very wealthy man. A trial like this is going to put Cardenas in the spot-light.
SATTLER: We've already got press arriving from over the country and she hasn't even been charged yet. Cardenas wants to see her in his office tomorrow at ten. I'd like you to go with her.
DULANEY: I'm supposed to be on vacation.
SATTLER: I know -- but she wants you to represent her if Cardenas files.
DULANEY: Why?
SATTLER: Because I told her you were the best criminal attorney we have.
DULANEY: Raymond, I'm the only criminal attorney you have.
SATTLER: Well, I guess that makes you the best. Look, Frank -- she stands to inherit three million dollars. As executors of the estate and her attorneys that could generate a lot of legal fees for us. All I'm asking you to do is talk to her.
DULANEY: Alright, I'll talk to her
SATTLER: She's waiting in the conference room.
