FRANCES: I think I need a little air.
LILLIAN: What's wrong?
FRANCES: Nothing. I think I'll just go out for awhile.
LILLIAN: Where are you going?
FRANCES: For a walk, Mama. Just a walk.
LILLIAN: How long will you be?
FRANCES: Not long.
LILLIAN: I'll have lunch ready by one.
FRANCES: I'll be back.
LILLIAN: At one. Promise?
FRANCES: Sure.
LILLIAN: Say you promise.
FRANCES: I promise I'll... I promise, Mama.
LILLIAN: You know, the surest way to lose an appetite, is to drink, little sister.
FRANCES: Yes, Mama.
LILLIAN: I don't want you drinking, Frances.
FRANCES: Yes, Mama.
FRANCES: ...So what do you think?
ERNEST: I don't know, honey. Your mother has such big plans for you.
FRANCES: I know that, Dad, but --
ERNEST: What you have to understand, Francie, is that she... well... she wanted so much for herself too, and for me, and she never really got to... The only time I ever saw her happy was if her name was in the papers... but she could have been... if times were different she could have been a politician or... I don't know.
FRANCES: But Dad, I'm asking about me. What do you think I should do?
ERNEST: Well, Francie, sometimes after you get your hands on something you want, it just doesn't look the same. Then you have to be real smart to know if you should hold onto it because it's all you've got... or just let it go. This is the way of things, but I guess you already know that.
FRANCES: Dad... whatever I decide, will it be okay with you?
ERNEST: Always. Always.
ERNEST: I'm sorry, I... I don't have a desk in my room, and...
FRANCES: I don't care, Dad. I love you.
ERNEST: I love you too, Francie.
FRANCES: I'm back, Mama.
LILLIAN: Oh Frances, do I have news for you! Guess who --
FRANCES: Wait, Mama, wait. I have something to tell you. I've decided... well... I'm not going to make movies anymore. I thought that's what I wanted, and I went after it with all my soul, the way you taught me, but I was miserable, Mama, and it nearly killed me. So now... now it's over. I want a different kind of life, something... simple. I want to live someplace quiet and peaceful... in the country maybe, and I'll have dogs and cats -- I feel so light suddenly, so clear for the first time in... It's going to be okay, Mama, I know it. And I love you.
LILLIAN: Don't... talk crazy.
FRANCES: Mama...?
LILLIAN: They want you back! Your agent called today! Don't you understand? He's sending the scripts. He wants to fly up here in a week with the publicity people! Frances, you can't do this to your fans! Why, they've been praying for you all through this nightmare. You can't turn your back on them now! Look at this fan mail I've been answering!
FRANCES: Haven't you heard what I said?
LILLIAN: I told him to come up! I told him you wanted to show them all that there's nothing wrong with you any more, that you're completely cured!
FRANCES: I'm not cured. I was never sick! They had no business putting me in there! My only responsibility is to myself now!
LILLIAN: You... you selfish, selfish child. At least talk to him, hear what he has to say.
FRANCES: No!
LILLIAN: You want to throw it all away, is that it? You had everything, little sister. Beauty... a brilliant career... a wonderful husband. You were a movie star!
FRANCES: Mama, shut up!
LILLIAN: And now you're throwing everything away? You're gonna be a nobody! Nobody! You know what that's like?!
FRANCES: You... You'd send me back, wouldn't you? You would.
LILLIAN: Where are you going?
FRANCES: I'm going out!
LILLIAN: You're not going anywhere!
FRANCES: Yes, I am, and you can't stop me! You can't tell me what to do, mother. I'm a grown woman, and I can decide about my own life.
LILLIAN: Frances!
