FEZZIK: I did that on purpose. I don't have to miss.
MAN IN BLACK: I believe you -- So what happens now?
FEZZIK: We face each other as God intended. Sportsmanlike. No tricks, no weapons, skill against skill alone.
MAN IN BLACK: You mean, you'll put down your rock and I'll put down my sword, and we'll try to kill each other like civilized people?
FEZZIK: I could kill you now.
MAN IN BLACK: Frankly, I think the odds are slightly in your favor at hand fighting.
FEZZIK: It's not my fault being the biggest and the strongest. I don't even exercise. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 38.
MAN IN BLACK: Look are you just fiddling around with me or what?
FEZZIK: I just want you to feel you're doing well. I hate for people to die embarrassed.
FEZZIK: You're quick.
MAN IN BLACK: And a good thing too.
FEZZIK: Why do you wear a mask? Were you burned by acid, or something like that? --------------------------------------------------------------------------- 39.
