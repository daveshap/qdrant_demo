I was wrong
I hate when people say to think of how much pain you'll cause others. They'll get over it, I always think. I'm just a burden anyway. They'll be sad for awhile, but better off in the long run.

Yesterday I intended to kill myself. My ex/roommate (it's complicated) caught me in the middle and called my wife to come home from work to keep an eye on me. When my wife got home she practically ran over to me and hugged me. She was trying so hard to hold herself together and be strong, but I could feel her whole body shaking.

She sat with me and we talked for awhile about nothing in particular. Just talked, joked, and laughed like we do. But even half an hour later I could still feel her hand trembling as she held mine. She was outwardly keeping it together so she could be there for me, but inside she was a wreck. Later, when I went up to our room to sleep, she had put one of her adorable stuffed animals on my pillow. It was such a small gesture, but it  made me feel loved.

I knew she would be sad, but I still underestimated how much she cared. I don't know if I'll ever forget that feeling. I don't think I should.

I wanted to share this for anyone else out there who thinks like I do. I was wrong. You might be too. There are plenty of people in my life who have turned out to not care at all when I thought they did. There's at least one who cares a whole lot more than I gave her credit for.
