Is it in an advisors best interest to graduate a PhD student?
If you're a PhD student, you are cheap labor for your advisor. Is it in your advisor's best interest to graduate you? Is there a rule in some university's code that requires you to be able to graduate after you've published X number of times? What is stopping your advisor from keeping you indefinitely? No official source, but I've heard MIT is notorious for keeping students around for long. True?

From another perspective, it is not in the profs best interest to keep you for too long because he/she wants to maintain his/her reputation as someone who chugs out graduate students at a healthy rate? A large grad student count also is a boost in reputation. 

Does the latter scenario seem more likely to happen to happen than the prior?
