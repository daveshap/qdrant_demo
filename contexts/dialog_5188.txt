RENAULT: Well, you were asking about Rick and here he is. Mademoiselle, may I present --
RICK: -- Hello, Ilsa.
ILSA: Hello, Rick.
RENAULT: Oh, you've already met Rick, Mademoiselle?
RENAULT: Well then, perhaps you also ---
ILSA: -- This is Mr. Laszlo.
LASZLO: How do you do?
RICK: How do you do?
LASZLO: One hears a great deal about Rick in Casablanca.
RICK: And about Victor Laszlo everywhere.
LASZLO: Won't you join us for a drink?
RENAULT: Oh, no, Rick never --
RICK: -- Thanks. I will.
RENAULT: Well! A precedent is being broken. Er, Emil!
LASZLO: This is a very interesting cafe. I congratulate you.
RICK: And I congratulate you.
LASZLO: What for?
RICK: Your work.
LASZLO: Thank you. I try.
RICK: We all try. You succeed.
RENAULT: I can't get over you two. She was asking about you earlier, Rick, in a way that made me extremely jealous.
ILSA: I wasn't sure you were the same. Let's see, the last time we met --
RICK: -- It was La Belle Aurore.""
ILSA: How nice. You remembered. But of course, that was the day the Germans marched into Paris.
RICK: Not an easy day to forget.
ILSA: No.
RICK: I remember every detail. The Germans wore gray, you wore blue.
ILSA: Yes. I put that dress away. When the Germans march out, I'll wear it again.
RENAULT: Ricky, you're becoming quite human. I suppose we have to thank you for that, Mademoiselle.
LASZLO: Ilsa, I don't wish to be the one to say it, but it's late.
RENAULT: So it is. And we have a curfew here in Casablanca. It would never do for the Chief of Police to be found drinking after hours and have to fine himself.
LASZLO: I hope we didn't overstay our welcome.
RICK: Not at all.
