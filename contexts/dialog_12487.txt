BRET: Hey if you're not doing anything I'd like to buy you a beer after work. Be just like old times.
TREVOR: What's the occasion?
BRET: I quit. Today's my last day.
BRET: I've got a better offer. More time off. A sort of career shift, more in the engineering line of work.
TREVOR: How much time off?
BRET: As much as he feels like. Its a much more pleasurable line of work.
