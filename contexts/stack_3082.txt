Does polarized light reflect in the same polarization? If vertically polarized light hits a linear polarizer aligned at a 45 degree angle from the polarization of the light, my understanding is 50% of the light will pass through and have its polarization changed and 50% will be blocked/reflected.For the 50% of light that is reflected off the polarizer (does not pass through), does its polarization remain vertical or does it change?
