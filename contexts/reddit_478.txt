Help a girl out please.
I need to know if this kid is flirting with me or if he's just being nice. We work together, and he has been the only one to ever initiate a conversation with me. The other people I work with don't seem too keen with me but I don't give a fuck, so anyway. I don't really know if he's just trying to be nice, or if he is... you know what thinking about it, he's just being nice. Who the fuck am I kidding? I am ugly. Nvm, thanks, guys <3
