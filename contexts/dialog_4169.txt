SANDY: Jeffrey, I don't think you ought to do it.
JEFFREY: Why not?
SANDY: It's crazy and dangerous. My God, I shouldn't have told you.
JEFFREY: It'll be okay. I don't think you should wait out here though. I think you should go home. Can you drive this car?
SANDY: Yeah, but.
JEFFREY: Leave it in the front of your house for me, okay?
SANDY: OK.
JEFFREY: Could you wait a little while, this key may not fit.
SANDY: I wish you wouldn't do this. It doesn't make any sense. Let's go somewhere and have some coffee.
JEFFREY: I'm going in, Sandy. I'll see you tomorrow and tell you how it went.
SANDY: I, I don't want to see you tomorrow. Mike's coming over.
JEFFREY: Oh, okay, can I call?
SANDY: Okay, yeah, call.
JEFFREY: Look, it can wait till Sunday.
SANDY: Call tomorrow. It's okay. Good luck. I hope you can sneak out okay. You're going to wait until she's asleep?
JEFFREY: Yeah.
SANDY: I'm going to wait here until she comes.
JEFFREY: Are you sure?
SANDY: I'll honk four times so you'll hear it and know she's on her way up. Okay?
JEFFREY: Okay, thanks.
SANDY: I don't know if you're a detective or a pervert.
JEFFREY: That's for me to know and for you to find out. I'll see you. I mean call you, okay?
SANDY: Okay, okay. Bye.
