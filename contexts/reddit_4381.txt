You have worked so hard to pick yourself up and I am right there with you
I always feel like no one takes time to appreciate how difficult it is for us to do all the things we are doing. We woke up yesterday. We might have gone out to get groceries. We might have talked to an acquaintance at work. We might have washed the dishes. Maybe we took our dog for a walk. It sometimes sucks to think that these 'simple' things that are negligible to most are humongous obstacles to us, but I want to take the time to say that I know it's hard and I couldn't be more proud of where you are right now. Even if it's in the worst moment of your life, it's been such a long and hard journey to get here. I cannot express my pride for us all and I can't wait for what we can accomplish once this is all over.
