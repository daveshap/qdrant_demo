How should I deal with my alcoholic manager?
My manager is an alcoholic and used to come in smelling of alcohol on a daily basis. This has reduced  slightly, however, he takes days off 'sick' frequently or days to sort out his 'taxes'. He always has a stupid excuse.

He barely does anything and is paid more than double what I am on and I basically manage the whole project for him. We've asked him to manage more but he doesn't. He's lazy and barely asks what we do and leaves early every day even when he knows we are busy.

The boss has gave him a couple of bollockings and he improved. However, the boss has left to go travelling and is working remotely so now it's just a small team of 4 including me. He has gotten worse again and has took yesterday and today off to deal with 'paperwork'.

In the past when we've called him we could hear that he was at a bar. I know where he lives and his local bars so I was going to drive over at lunch and have a look to catch him in the act. Is this the right thing to do?


TLDR: Alcoholic manager is off sick frequently, is useless and makes excuses so he can take the day off to go to a bar. Should I go and catch him in the act?
