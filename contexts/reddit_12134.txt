Moving back to my country after 5 years
Im leaving to the airport in 10 days, after 5 years of pretty much growing up + becoming legal here. From high school to a year of uni, I had host families who are the world, giving me a family that I never had (crappy home environment) and the best host parents who were pretty much my 2nd mother and father. The friends that I've made here are the closest people who were always there for me. And now, after dropping out of uni prematurely, I'm going back to the country I left at 15.

It didn't kick in until I stared face to face at the airplane ticket. Before I was ecstatic finally chasing my dream of joining the army, and that I can keep in touch with friends via social media. I was nowhere close to sad, but euphoric. Even telling myself that I won't shed any tears. However, it's only these few days having visited some friends where I had started falling apart. I couldn't stop crying when I hugged my host mom a farewell. I couldn't stop crying when I realise that I'm also leaving the warmness behind. 

It wasnt just the friends that I'm missing, it's the world around me. My every day life. The jolly breeze of Australia. The culture of individuality and carefreeness. People that actually care for one another. All gone when I return to Singapore. 

Now, I still can't stop crying. I know that this would be the best decision of my life, but I essentially grew up here. Home was Australia , not Singapore. Heck, I remember most of my life here, and these 5 years were the most impactful. This was the place that had moulded me into the person I am now. Everything hurts. I didnt realised how much I loved it here until I have to leave. Now, here I am trying to be positive about my new upcoming chapter in my life, while I can't let go of the current chapter that's about to come to an end.

 I'm going to miss my forever home. Gosh I'm going to dread that airport goodbye. It's just so difficult.
