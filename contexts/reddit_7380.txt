Best Job Boards to Find Niche Talent
Everyone knows the job boards like Craigslist, Indeed, and Monster, but there are over 100 different other job boards that specialize in various niche industries.

As someone applying to jobs, this can be great because you can find a much more targeted list of opportunities based on your career desires.

Also, as a business owner, they can be a great resource to find a targeted interested pool of candidates for a low cost.

A few examples I've come across:

* Creative: [TalentZoo](http://www.talentzoo.com/), [Art Jobs](http://artjobs.artsearch.us/)
* Media: [MediaBistro](http://www.mediabistro.com/)
* Startups: [Angelist](https://angel.co/)
* Nonprofit: [Idealist.org](http://www.idealist.org/)
* Technology: [Dice](http://www.dice.com/), [Stack Overflow](http://careers.stackoverflow.com/)
* Legal: [LawJobs](http://lawjobs.com/)
* Restaurant/Hospitality: [Culintro](http://culintro.com/), [PoachedJob](http://poachedjobs.com/choose)
* Finance: [eFinancialCareers](http://www.efinancialcareers.com/)
* Government: [USAJobs.gov](https://www.usajobs.gov/)
* Internships: [Internships.com](http://www.internships.com/)
* Sales: [SalesGravy.com](http://www.salesgravy.com/)
* Healthcare: [CareerVitals](http://www.careervitals.com/)
* Constructions: [RigZone](http://www.rigzone.com/)
* Retail: [WorkInRetail](http://www.workinretail.com/)

Sometimes it takes looking beyond the first page of Google search results to find these boards, but they are a great resource for job seekers and people hiring.

As an employer, you can also use sites like [Proven](http://www.proven.com) and [ZipRecruiter](http://www.ziprecruiter.com) to post automatically to a lot of these niche jobs as well as the big dogs like Craigslist and Indeed.

Anyone else have a good experience with a niche job board? Some of the intern ones have worked great for me in the past.
