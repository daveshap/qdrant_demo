HARRY: As God is my witness, I have never done anything to that woman.
SUZIE: You must have done something to her.
HARRY: Since she has repented, all she does is throw stones.
SUZIE: Hattie is a different person now.
HARRY: I don't make no bones about where I'm going to spend eternity. I have always been wild and you know that. If you are made to feel half a man, what do you think the other half is?
SUZIE: I'm glad you brought that up as to who you are. I have to know who is in my house.
HARRY: You invited me.
SUZIE: Only if you are a good man, a friend. Are you a friend?
