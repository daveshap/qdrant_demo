BUNNY: 350 pounds.
SAM: What?
BUNNY: This boy from West Side, plays tackle both ways. Bench-presses 350 pounds. You imagine having that much weight on top of you? Pushing down? Be hard to breathe. Hard to swallow.
SAM: I think they have another fella there to keep it off your chest. A spotter.
BUNNY: I only got my little girl now
SAM: You look good, Bunny. It's nice to see you.
BUNNY: Thanks. I like it when you say that, Sam.
