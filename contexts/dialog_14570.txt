ELLEN: What's wrong?
BRODY: Ooohh, nothing. I just got fired, that's all.
ELLEN: What?
BRODY: What'd I say?
ELLEN: That you were fired.
BRODY: Then that's what I meant. Fired. Canned. Out on my fanny. The Selectmen just made Hendricks the new Chief of Police. Just like that.
ELLEN: Because of today? The beach?
BRODY: No sweat. A blessing in disguise. Back to the city, you can go to Bloomingdale's without waiting six hours for the ferryboat...we're surrounded by water here, you realize that? Me, surrounded by water...Ridiculous.
ELLEN: Stop that! We're not going any place. You love it here. Tell me what the hell happened!
BRODY: Showed them the photo, showed them the goddamn Shark, big as life. They didn't see it. Not like me. Not like the poor son-of-a-bitch who snapped this li'l picture...He's out there, somewhere... I shot off my gun, shot off my big mouth, so they fired me....
ELLEN: Honey, this is nothing...I don't know what it is. What did they....
BRODY: ...Everybody wants the job. No one wants the authority. Except Hendricks. Fine. He can go out there in that precious boat, and when he looks whitey in his big mouth he can just call me. Call me in New York...tell him to kiss my ass....
ELLEN: They have no right to treat you like that. You've given them every- thing. For four years, you've protected this town, the people on this island....
BRODY: Fired me! I'm not a hysterical man. I'm responsible. I know what I saw....
ELLEN: I know you did....
BRODY: I try. Goddamnit, I tried...Now, I'm tired...I can't keep fighting it...I'm too tired...I'm...I'm....
