HAMILTON: General Greene is here. There are two other divisions here.
WASHINGTON: Colonel Hamilton. Anyone who served under Arnold, I want them shipped north. I don't want any troops here who served under Arnold.
HAMILTON: Yessir.
WASHINGTON: Did you know that Arnold left the entire defenses of this fort in complete disrepair? Most of our cannons are so neglected they may as well have been spiked!? You realize what would happen if this fort fell? The whole Hudson would be open to them!
