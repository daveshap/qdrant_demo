what statistics should I use for demonstrating two data points I want to plot a time-series of emissions of a pollutant. For each year, I only have two data, one min value and one max value for the emissions.I only demonstrated the min, max and mean value in the time-series figure, but my boss said it was not enough. Should I use mean plus standard errors or Confidence Intervals or SD or others? and why it is better than just demonstrate min-mean-max?
