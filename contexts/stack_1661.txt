GPSDO in firmware? There are numerous designs online for hardware GPSDO (GPS-disciplined Oscillators). I'm failing to find any firmware-only implementations. I wonder if my Google foo is weak or if these are impractical in firmware.My scenario is a uC (an STM32) with a GPS. I need to output a 1Hz pulse that aligns with GPS PPS, even during loss of signal. Naturally, during LOS the output is only as good as my local oscillator, but I'd like to adjust relevant timer's timebase to average or recent GPS PPSs.I'm sure someone has done something similar.
