CONROY: Just a boid in a gilded cage -
STEW: A what?
CONROY: You heard me. A bird in a gilded cage.
STEW: Aw, you've been reading a lot of cheap tabloids. Anne and myself are going to move downtown in a nice little flat, we're gonna forget all about this social stuff, and we're gonna be known as Mr. and Mrs. Stew Smith. How do you like that?
CONROY: And live on your salary, I suppose?
STEW: Yeah, live on my salary - that is, until I finish writing my play.
CONROY: What play?
STEW: My play.
CONROY: The one about the Siberian bloodhound?
STEW: Siberian bloodhound? No. That's been all rewritten. It's laid in Araby now.
CONROY: Araby?
STEW: Sure.
CONROY: Araby, my eye—!
CONROY: Well, I'm sorry to see a good reporter go blooey— Let me know when you're quitting.
STEW: I'm not quitting!
CONROY: No?
STEW: No!
