SOPHIE: Casandra. Old girlfriend?
SAMI: Something like that.
SOPHIE: Did she break your heart?
SAMI: Something like that.
SOPHIE: It looks old. Did you get it a long time ago?
SAMI: You ask a lot of questions.
SOPHIE: That's how you get to know someone. Did it hurt when you got it?
SAMI: I don't remember. I was drunk.
SOPHIE: You got it in a bar?
SAMI: No. I got it in prison. I went in for three years. When I came out she was married to my best friend. Happy?
SOPHIE: Sorry. I didn't mean to pry.
SAMI: It's okay. It was a long time ago.
SOPHIE: I've been thinking about getting tattoo. You know, a flower or something. On my ass.
SAMI: Who's gonna see it there?
SOPHIE: The lucky ones.
