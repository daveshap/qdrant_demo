MARION: Don't touch him.
LEE: How many men have we seen die?
MARION: Two. Gabriel and Thomas.
LEE: They're gone. And there is nothing you or I can do to bring them back. But there is something you can do to help end all this.
MARION: It is ended.
LEE: No. It's not over yet. Two days ride, Yorktown, Virginia. Washington, the French, Cornwallis and Tarleton. It will end, one way or another. Francis, nothing will replace your sons but helping us will justify their sacrifice.
