XANDER: I think I'll hang on to these.
SHAVERS: Think again, that's government property. You have to sign for everything. I've got one more that wasn't on your list.
XANDER: From the Beastie Boys collection?
SHAVERS: It's a stakeout suit. It's got food, water, recording gear, anything you need for covert spying. It's all- weather, fire retardant, and if you give this buckle a sharp pull, the whole outfit deploys into a parachute.
XANDER: You're joking, right?
SHAVERS: Now that I've given you the overview, we're going to spend the next couple hours going into extensive operational detail.
XANDER: I thought that was in detail.
