DOM: Gay? He said you were gay?
TED: He implied it.
DOM: Well you're a writer, and a lot of writers are gay. Look at Truman Capote.
TED: Yeah, but he was successful.
DOM: Let me ask you this: When you smoke a cigar, do you ever pretend it has balls?
TED: Come on, that wouldn't make me gay.
DOM: I'm going to fix you up with my new assistant.
TED: What's he like?
DOM: You're leaving it out. Finish your swing. You're going to like this one -- she's half Asian, half American.
TED: Good-looking?
DOM: I just told you, she's half Asian. half American. They're all good looking. You could mate Don Rickles and Yoko Ono and they're going to have a gorgeous kid. It's a foolproof combo.
TED: What's the point? Let's face it, Dom, I'm in a slump. Lately I've been feeling like... well... like a loser.
DOM: Loser? You?
DOM: Give me a break. Remember five years ago, when your kidneys failed? If you were a loser would they have been able to find a donor with an exact tissue match? What are the odds of that, one in a million?
TED: Oh, so I'm lucky because my brother got killed in an explosion?
DOM: I never said that. I'm saying your lucky those kids found his kidneys. Besides, your brother Jimmy never gave a shit about you.
