127v 60hz TV to 220v 50hz Hi all I recently moved from Mexico to Portugal and brought some electronics I suspect they are multi voltage and multi frequency. But reading the label of a Sony TV I got into doubt if it is or not multi village/frequency.Attached a photo of the label. Can I plug this TV straight on power outlet? My doubt is because in the center of the label says Energy Performance Verified 127v 60hz.Thank you for any advice,Hope it also applies for my Sharp one. Does it?Thanks again
