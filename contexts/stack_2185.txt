Is there an optimal time to promote from the villager class? In most Fire Emblem games, there's an \"optimal\" time to promote - that is, you hit level 20 with the base class, and then you promote the unit so that it keeps 20 levels worth of stat growth. Does stat growth work the same way in Fire Emblem Echoes: Shadows of Valentia? (and is the villager --> main class process a \"promotion\"?) Can I try to max out the villager class, and then promote the unit so that they have the max stat growth? Or do their stats reset when they choose a main class?
