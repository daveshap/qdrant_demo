Does backing up a database shrink the transaction log size? I am trying to gather some knowledge on SQL databases and I have some questions about the transaction log file (LDF).First off, when you create a database, you have to define an Initial File Size for both the database and the log file. From what I can see, once the files are created on the disk, they will be of that specified size regardless if there is actual data in the database or if there has been any transactions (logs).My understanding was that backing up a database:Truncates the transaction log, andShrinks the sizeof the LDF file on the disk by \"emptying\" the logs inside it.Now it seems that I was not understanding this correctly because the log file seems to be of fixed size. My actual question goes like this:What does truncating logs actually do to the log file (LDF)? This process is supposed to prevent disks from getting full.Please do correct me if I am not understanding some concepts correctly.Thank you!
