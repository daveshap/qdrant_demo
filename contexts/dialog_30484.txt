SID 6.7: Don't be angry with me, Daryl.
LINDENMEYER: Did you recognize the son-of-a bitch who got away?
SID 6.7: Should I have?
LINDENMEYER: Think hard -- it'll come to you...
WALLACE: You embarrassed me in front of the highest—ranking law enforcement official in the country. Do you have any idea how much money you just cost me?
LINDENMEYER: The reason you insisted on testing my system with prisoners is because of the increased risks involved with increased realism.
WALLACE: Of the six prison inmates you've tested —— all of whom have had at least some military or survival training -— only Mr. Barnes is still breathing.
LINDENMEYER: I'm still making adjustments...
WALLACE: You've had a year—and—a—half to make all the adjustments you want, Lindenmeyer. ) Elizabeth Deane does not give second chances. Neither do I. You're fired.
LINDENMEYER: I'M WHAT?!
WALLACE: You are to turn over the Sid 6.7 program, and all its documentation, for immediate destruction. Is that understood?
LINDENMEYER: I understand... I understand perfectly.
