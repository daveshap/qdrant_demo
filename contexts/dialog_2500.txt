BRIAN: Thanks for the invite.
JENNIFER: Got anything to drink in there?
BRIAN: Oh, there might be something stashed away for emergencies.
BRIAN: This is one of the oldest fire stations in the city. Lotta tradition locked up in here. What do you think?
JENNIFER: Homey.
BRIAN: See that trap door up there? That used to lead to the hay loft when they had horse-drawn engines. It was pretty different then... but kinda the same, y'know?
JENNIFER: Do you miss it? You seem like you do.
BRIAN: When I came back, I knew more than anything else that I wanted to be a fireman.
JENNIFER: Then why did you quit?
BRIAN: I wanted to be a good one.
