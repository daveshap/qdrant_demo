ROY: So, you think you're gonna find his scalp hanging in some tepee?
BALLARD: They no longer live in tepees, Mr. College Graduate.
ROY: Did you send anyone out there?
BALLARD: You bet I did. I got a squad car on the way to the reservation right now.
ROY: Bad idea...
BALLARD: You just go write your little story, Roy. I'll handle the police work...
ROY: You better handle what's in this garbage can first.
WESLEY: I still don't understand how you knew Del was telling the truth.
CHARLIE: I saw his soul Wesley. He was face to face with his God, and no one lies in that situation. But your Geronimo act rattled me, and I abandoned my instincts. Never abandon you instincts.
WESLEY: I didn't. You gave me a look!
CHARLIE: What 'look'?
WESLEY: That one look you got! I thought you were done, so I took him out...
CHARLIE: I wasn't done, I was just sick of hearing him whine. And you didn't take him out, you scalped him. Christ, I almost puked, did I tell you that?
WESLEY: Well, why'd you have to tell that Indian story?
CHARLIE: What the hell does that mean? If I'd told a Ty Cobb story would you have clubbed him to death with a bat?
CHARLIE: It's not here. Let's go.
WESLEY: You just gonna leave these cars sitting here like this?
CHARLIE: Why not, it'll confuse 'em... gotta do something, now that you fucked it up.
WESLEY: I wanted to make a statement.
CHARLIE: Let me tell you something. In our business you can't put food on the table if your phone doesn't ring. The guys who get the calls are good -- not flashy, just good. They get in, they get out. Nobody knows a goddamn thing. Understand? Boom, boom, boom. Three in the head and you know they're dead.
WESLEY: ...that's a good motto.
CHARLIE: Fine, I'll get you a bumpersticker, but you better start believing it! It's the only statement you need to make.
