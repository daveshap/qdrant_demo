Do US based militia groups have legal jurisdiction to detain immigrants on the US Southern border? What are their powers? Do these rules differ across border States, and are there specific Federal laws that supersede?
A leader of a militia group that detains immigrants crossing the Southern border was [arrested on Saturday](https://www.washingtonpost.com/immigration/2019/04/21/an-armed-militia-was-detaining-migrants-border-fbi-arrested-its-leader/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.cde0955f24fb) in New Mexico. His arrest, however, is not related to militia actions but to owning firearms as a felon:

> Larry Mitchell Hopkins, 69, also known as Johnny Horton Jr., was arrested in Sunland Park, N.M., on charges of being a felon in possession of firearms and ammunition, the FBI Albuquerque office said.

The militia group, the United Constitutional Patriots, and [others like it, have been a rising issue](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/us-militia-groups-head-to-border-stirred-by-trumps-call-to-arms/2018/11/03/ff96826c-decf-11e8-b3f0-62607289efee_story.html?utm_term=.a815bc4f49bc) for several months:

> According to military planning documents obtained by Newsweek, the military is concerned about the arrival of “unregulated militia members self-deploying to the border in alleged support” of U.S. Customs and Border Protection.

> The assessment estimates that 200 militia members could show up. “They operate under the guise of citizen patrols,” the report said, while warning of “incidents of unregulated militias stealing National Guard equipment during deployments.”

Specific to Mitchel's group, reportedly they had been told what they were doing was illegal (from source 1):

> The militia maintains that its actions are legal, though Sunland Park Police Chief Javier Guerra told BuzzFeed News he had explicitly informed the group that they are not.

However as noted, Mitchel's arrest was not pertaining to the groups actions, but to a different charge.

A U.S. Customs and Border Protection spokesman did not endorse the groups actions either, however a member of the group says on the ground their actions are appreciated (from source 1): 

> One of its members, Mark Cheney, told BuzzFeed News that Border Patrol officers are “happy we’re here. … We have a direct line to the local outpost.”

Both the [Democratic Governor and ACLU of New Mexico](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/latino/no-authority-new-mexico-governor-tells-militia-stop-arresting-migrants-n996516) have expressed that they do not approve of militia groups on the Southern border.

Mexico has [recently expressed alarm](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-immigration-mexico-border/mexico-warns-of-deep-concern-over-armed-groups-on-u-s-border-idUSKCN1RW0N6) at the issue.

I have a couple questions about this:

1: Can militia groups detain immigrants on the Southern border? 

2: What laws regulate the actions of these groups? Are there different laws State by State, or are there Federal superseding laws?
