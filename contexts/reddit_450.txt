MMA training
Hey everyone I have been training some MMA lately with a friend and I have been enjoying it for the most part 
But
At the end of each training session the class does something called a roll where u grapple for 3 mins and then change partners which is good for learning submissions 

My problem is I have to roll with a guy who is like 20 and he just over powers me and feels me up or else puts me in choke holds which hurt loads and leave legit marks on me 

I spoke to my friend about this and he just says MMA is a rough sport and he had seen the guy going hard on everyone   And I should just chill ?

So I’m asking if I’m over reacting to this because his hands went up my top more than once now
