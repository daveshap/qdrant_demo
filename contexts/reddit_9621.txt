Classes to prepare for Student Affairs & Higher Education Master's?
I am a current undergraduate student majoring in Linguistics with a minor in education. Beyond my major and minor requirements, I have room to take elective classes, and I want to take classes that might help me prepare for coursework in a student affairs/higher education program. What departments/subjects should I take classes in? I've been thinking about taking classes in psychology or sociology. Any help would be appreciated!
