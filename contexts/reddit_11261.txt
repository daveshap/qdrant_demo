I'm Muslim and queer and I hate my life
I was raised in a super conservative homophobic environment till high school, and couldn't find the courage to come out in college, mostly b/c many of my friends were Muslim and it's extremely taboo to express a sexuality that isn't heterosexual. I came out to a couple girls, but couldn't tell any of my male friends because I didn't want them to think I was coming on to them.

Keeping this secret from everyone is taking a toll on me mentally. My self esteem and confidence are nonexistent. I'm struggling with anxiety and depression, and I feel that when I'm around friends--especially male friends--I'm hyper sensitive to how i'm behaving and making sure I don't do anything society would associate with being gay. And when I find myself attracted to one of my guy friends, it never ends well. I want to have male friendships. I just want to live a normal life, and I've tried talking to counselors about this but it's just so embarrassing. 

I don't know what else to say. I'm exhausted of this, and I'm nearing the end of the rope. Please help :(
