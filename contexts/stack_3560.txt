hashcat specific brute force Is this scenario possible:I know the first three letters of the password (exact), i know the password is between 10-14 characters, i know the rest of the characters are \"b,t,p,1,3,6,7\" which can be repeated any number of times, and the file encrypted is a 7z file.Is a masked attack this specific possible? i don't want to waste two months, i pratically know the password, it's just i used too many variations of it that i can't seem to open the file anymore.Thanks for your time
