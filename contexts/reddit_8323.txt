What barriers exist to lowering the base cost of health care in the US, as opposed to reforming insurance coverage that merely funds it?
The price of health care in the US is [higher than anywhere else in the world](http://content.healthaffairs.org/content/22/3/89.full.html). These costs are sometimes described as [inflated](https://www.forbes.com/sites/rickungar/2013/05/08/the-great-american-hospital-pricing-scam-exposed-we-now-know-why-healthcare-costs-are-so-artificially-high/#2792ac7a3bff), and [highly variable](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/special/national/actual-cost-of-medical-care/). However, very little effort seems to be expended in Washington (so far as I know or can Google) to reform the system that gives rise to those high prices, as opposed to merely funding it via the ACA, Medicare, or other legislative options.

Why should this be the case?



Edit: Unsurprisingly, this is an incredibly complex issue. Between source links and individuals' insight, you all have given me enough reading material for the next several hours. My family has higher-than-average medical costs, and coping with medical issues inside of what I perceive to be a broken system is perpetually infuriating. This conversation is not about to fix anything, but it helps knowing it's something other people have thought of. It's also just pretty fun to commiserate. :)
