There is no penalty for violating a 1990 budget law requiring Presidents to submit their budget plans by early Feb. Since '90, four out of five Presidents have submitted late budgets. Does this law have any tangible effects without enforcement, and what was the impetus to pass it in the first place?
In 1990, Congress passed a law that includes a provision that the [White House must submit a budget by the first Monday in February](https://www.rollcall.com/news/deadline-presidential-budget-request-often-missed).

> The deadline is the first Monday in February pursuant to a 1990 budget law, though there’s no penalty for missing it.

Clinton, Bush (2000), and Obama all missed their budget deadlines.

> Clinton’s first budget was 66 days late. Bush’s first budget was 63 days late and Obama hit a historic record with a 94-day late submission of his inaugural budget.

President Trump released his [2019 budget a little late](https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/373413-trump-releases-2019-budget), and [expects his 2020 budget to submitted by mid March](https://www.defensenews.com/pentagon/2019/02/06/budget-for-fiscal-2020-expected-to-be-released-march-12/) (also sourced in [WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-to-begin-releasing-fiscal-2020-budget-plan-on-march-11-11549324514)).

Four out of five Presidents since 1990 have submitted late budgets. Some, multiple times.

I have a couple questions trying to understand how this law exists and why:

1: Does this law do anything - is there a tangible effect or evidence to suggest we get budgets from the WH earlier because of it?

2: How did this law come about - what was the impetus to pass this law?

Side question for clarity: Is this provision part of the Budget Enforcement act of 1990?
