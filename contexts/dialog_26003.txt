MIKEY: Consuelo?
CONSUELO: Yes, Mikey?
MIKEY: Do you have any brothers or sisters?
CONSUELO: Yes.
MIKEY: Really? How many?
CONSUELO: Four brothers and five sisters.
MIKEY: Wow. Why did your parents have so many children? I mean, if they were poor, wouldn't it be better to have just one or two?
CONSUELO: It was God's will.
MIKEY: But do you really believe in God? And heaven, hell and angels and all kind of stuff?
CONSUELO: No.
MARTY: So? How was school today?
SCOOBY: The same.
MARTY: The same. Same as what?
SCOOBY: Just the same.
BRADY: We're studying the Holocaust in Social Studies.
MARTY: Oh, yeah?
SCOOBY: We did the same thing last year also.
FERN: How was the class?
BRADY: Well, I'm supposed to watch Schindler's List for homework. The movie's like almost four hours. And then I'm supposed to write a report on survivors. You know any survivors, Dad?
MARTY: Hmmm...Do I know any...personally...?
FERN: Well, technically your Zeda is a survivor.
BRADY: He was in a concentration camp?
FERN: Well, no. But he had to escape the Nazis.
BRADY: But I thought he came over to America before the war.
FERN: Well, he did. With his family. But his cousins, they had to stay and they were all killed. And if he'd stayed, he would have been killed. So in my book he's a survivor.
BRADY: Even though it was only his cousins that were killed?
FERN: But that could've happened to him. Or to me, if I'd been alive. Or you.
