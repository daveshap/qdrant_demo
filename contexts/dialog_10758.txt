SEYMOUR: Uh... hi. Uh... Enid's stepmother told me I'd find her here?
REBECCA: She's not at home?
SEYMOUR: No... they said she was here...
REBECCA: What the fuck is she doing?! She was supposed to be here three hours ago!
SEYMOUR: Uh, do you mind if I wait? I really need to talk to her.
REBECCA: Are you sure she wasn't there? Maybe she was just hiding from you.
SEYMOUR: Why would she be hiding from me?
REBECCA: I don't know... where is she, then?
SEYMOUR: Maybe she's with Josh?
REBECCA: Josh!? Why would she be with Josh?
SEYMOUR: I don't know.
REBECCA: Why? What did she tell you?
SEYMOUR: She just mentioned him a few times and said that they had been dating - I thought maybe she was...
REBECCA: What? Is she having some secret affair with Josh?
SEYMOUR: I have no idea - I just want to...
REBECCA: Why wouldn't she tell me? There's no way! She could never keep that to herself... you're crazy.
SEYMOUR: Really, I don't know enough about it to...
REBECCA: That slut!
SEYMOUR: Why did you say she might be hiding from me? Did she say anything to you about me?
REBECCA: Yeah, she thinks you're a dork.
SEYMOUR: Did she say that?
REBECCA: Look, what do you expect? Considering how we met you.
SEYMOUR: What do you mean?
REBECCA: On that pathetic fake blind date.
SEYMOUR: What are you talking about?
REBECCA: Didn't she ever tell you about that? God, she really is pathological...
SEYMOUR: What fake blind date? What are you talking about?
