Career change for an extreme introvert who's tired of programming?
What the title says. i've been a web developer for years. I've worked through the fall of the cubicle and the rise of the open office. Every day I have to kowtow around an anxiety attack. The workplace is not a bunch of quiet nerds like I was lead to believe my whole life but a bunch of gregarious men going through mid life crises. I'm sick of the company telling us "we're a family" and I'm even more sick of the people who actually believe that HR drivel. It seems like every back to school path for someone fed up with their career is "learn to code lol" I feel so stuck and depressed, and yes before anyone asks I'm seeing a therapist weekly. What path can I take to be happy in life and not dread waking up every day?
