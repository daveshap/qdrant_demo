If there's one positive I've found from this quarantine, it's that a video date for a first date is a great idea
Takes a ton of pressure off, it's perfectly acceptable to make it short, you focus on conversation more than anything, and if the vibe is off or the person doesn't look like their profile, you spent $0 and didn't even have to leave the house. I think I may incorporate this into my regular dating practice tbh.
