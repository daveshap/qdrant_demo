DICK: You learn your lines?
FRANCES: Sort of.
DICK: There've been some calls.
FRANCES: Who?
DICK: Well... about half an hour ago that woman from the talent department called, what's her name?
FRANCES: Claire?
DICK: Yeah, Claire. She said she was fired. Too bad, huh?
FRANCES: Fired?
DICK: Yeah. She said she delivered your message and that you'd understand.
DICK: There was another call too. From your agent. He says your summer stock deal is all set. So you're going back east, huh?
FRANCES: ...Yes.
DICK: Without me.
FRANCES: Showdown.
DICK: You weren't going to tell me, were you? Just pack up and leave, is that it?
FRANCES: Dick, we need some time apart --
DICK: Hey, I'm not a complete fool, you know. I can see you're going sour on me, and when I try to do something about it, you turn your back and say it's nothing.
FRANCES: Dick, I can't even breathe here...
DICK: Dwayne! I'm Dwayne now! And you damn well better get used to it!
FRANCES: Dick...
DICK: I don't suppose it occurred to you that I might want to leave too, that I might want to do theatre? No, 'cause you don't want me along, do you? And the reason has nothing to do with summer stock.
FRANCES: No?
DICK: No. It's all about that night, isn't it?
FRANCES: What night?
DICK: The premiere. I never pressed you about it but god damn it, you're gonna tell me right here and right now what happened and where the hell you were!
FRANCES: You want his name?
