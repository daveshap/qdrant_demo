SOCIETY RED: He'll never make it.
KOKO: What are you talking about?
SOCIETY RED: He doesn't know when to give in. They'll kill him.
KOKO: Give in? That's our Luke out there.
DRAGLINE: That ole box collapse and fall apart before Luke calls quits.
SOCIETY RED: Your Luke's got more guts than brains.
KOKO: I don't see no sign of guts in you.
SOCIETY RED: No. No chains either.
KOKO: You ain't man enough to wear them!
SOCIETY RED: But you're dog enough. Maybe they'll let you sleep outside the box near your master.
KOKO: Big deal paper hanger! Hell, anyone who can write can pass fifty-sixty dollar checks. Like breakin' open a piggy bank.
SOCIETY RED: You've been having bad luck with masters, haven't you? Your last one left you when the cops came... and now Luke. You should complain to the S.P.C.A.
KOKO: You phony creep!
