ELTON: We gotta get on home an' relieve the sitter. Why'nt you an' Ray come on over.
BOBBY: Okay. Go ahead. I'll settle up for the beers... An' walk Rayette over with you, will you.
WAITRESS: Can I get you anything else?
BOBBY: No. How much do I owe you?
WAITRESS: Five'll do it.
TWINKY: We been wantin' to ask you something. Are you the guy on YV?
BOBBY: Am I on TV?
TWINKY: She says you're the one that sells all the cars on TV.
BOBBY: Well, I don't claim to have sold 'em all. They still have some left, I believe.
BETTY: See, I told you it was him... Your name's Donnie something, right?
BOBBY: I leave it to you.
BETTY: My name is Shirley, but they call me Betty, and her name's Twinky.
BOBBY: Twinky?
BETTY: Yeah, 'cause she's so twinky"..."
BOBBY: Well, Betty and Twinky, it sure is nice talking to you girls. I just wish I had more time...
BETTY: That's a wig you wear, isn't it?
BOBBY: A wig?
BETTY: Yeah, I told her it was you, but that you're wearing a wig, 'cause on TV you're mostly bald in the front.
BOBBY: Your little friend's real sharp there... Yeah, I don't like to wear the wig on TV, because with two and a half million people watching you, you've gotta be sincere. I just like to wear it when I'm out slippin' around bowling alleys an' things like that. I think it gives me a little more class, don't you?
