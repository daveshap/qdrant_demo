We had a good run, but I'm out
Just got my appeal decision. Ended up at $26,000/year in scholarship. I'm grateful, but I just can't afford to pay the other $49k. It's been great seeing all of you strive higher and achieve all sorts of incredible things. Maybe I'll be luckier next time. Til then I'll be leaving the college bubble. Thanks for everything A2C <3

  EDIT FOR CLARIFICATION: Thank you for all the lovely responses!! And I agree that it's fucked up that even with over $100k in total scholarship I couldn't possibly pay for college in America. It sucks.
   
To be clear though, I'm International. While it really stings that I can't go to my dream school despite getting in, I am by no means out of options. There are affordable schools here that I can go to, and overall my situation is one of privilege. I'm not looking at "proper" colleges tho, hence my wording. 
  
 I didn't expect so many people to chime in and offer support (you are all lovely, did you know that?) so I wasn't as clear as I should've been at first! My heart goes out to everyone who is unable to pay for a college education and doesn't have other options readily available. It's a fucked up system. I hope you know that you are amazing nonetheless.
