Guidelines and Laws surrounding Special Forces Identies, Operational Security.
During President Trump's recent "surprise visit" to the troops on Iraq he apparently took photos and video where ["the White House communications team revealed that a U.S. Navy SEAL team was deployed to Iraq ... [And] did not shield the faces of special operation forces"](https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-navy-seal-iraq-video-1272102) when posted to social media.  This is reportedly out of step with traditional precautions, has dangerous repercussions for them in field,  and in the case of the Newsweek article claims that this information is "classified"  and a "closely held secret". 

I'm looking to answer the following questions:

1. How accurate is this reporting?
2. What are the rules surrounding Identies of Special Forces generally, and specifically the Navy Seals?
3. Would the president posting classified information online automatically declassify it, and does he have the absolute autonomy to do so?
4. Is there a real danger to Operational Security from Trump's actions?
