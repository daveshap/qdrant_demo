SMUTS: Mr. Gandhi, I've more or less decided to ask the House to repeal the Act that you have taken such exception" to."
GANDHI: Well, if you ask, General Smuts, I'm sure it will be done.
SMUTS: Hm. Of course it is not quite that simple.
GANDHI: Somehow I expected not.
SMUTS: I'm glad to hear you say that... very glad. You see if we repeal the Act under pressure under this kind of pressure it will create a great deal of resentment. Can you understand that?
GANDHI: Very well.
SMUTS: Good. Good. I have thought of calling for a Royal Commission to investigate" the new legislation. I think I could guarantee they would recommend the Act be repealed."
GANDHI: I congratulate them.
