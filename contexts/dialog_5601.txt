BARTHOLOMEW: Have some, please. I've got... ...liverwurst -- liverwurst -- chicken and -- liverwurst.
REGGIE: No thanks.
BARTHOLOMEW: Do you know what C.I.A. is, Mrs. Lampert?
REGGIE: I don't suppose it's an airline, is it?
BARTHOLOMEW: Central Intelligence Agency -- C.I.A.
REGGIE: You mean spies and things like that?
BARTHOLOMEW: Only we call them agents.
REGGIE: We? You mean you're --?
BARTHOLOMEW: Someone has to do it, Mrs. Lampert --
REGGIE: I'm sorry, it's just that I didn't think that you people were supposed to admit --
BARTHOLOMEW: I'm not an agent, Mrs. Lampert -- I'm an administrator -- a desk jockey -- trying to run a bureau of overworked men with under-allocated funds. Congress seems to think that all a spy needs --
REGGIE: Agent.
BARTHOLOMEW: Yes -- That all he needs is a code book and a cyanide pill and he's in business.
REGGIE: What's all this got to do with me, Mr. Bartholomew?
BARTHOLOMEW: Your husband was wanted by the U. S. government.
REGGIE: May I have a sandwich, please?
BARTHOLOMEW: To be more specific, he was wanted by this agency.
REGGIE: So that was it.
BARTHOLOMEW: Yes. We knew him, of course, by his real name.
REGGIE: His -- real -- ?
BARTHOLOMEW: Voss -- Charles Voss. All right, Mrs. Voss -- -- I'd like you to look at this photograph, please -- by the way, you saw this one, didn't you? Scott, Cathy, and Ham, Jr.
REGGIE: Very sweet.
BARTHOLOMEW: Aren't they? Now look at this one, Mrs. Voss, and --
REGGIE: Stop calling me that! Lampert's the name on the marriage license.
BARTHOLOMEW: Yes -- and tell me if you recognize anyone. Just a moment. Have a good look.
REGGIE'S VOICE: It's Charles!
BARTHOLOMEW'S VOICE: Very good.
REGGIE'S VOICE: He looks so young -- when was this taken?
BARTHOLOMEW'S VOICE: 1944. The next face, please.
REGGIE'S VOICE: It's the man who came to the funeral yesterday -- I'm sure of it -- a tall man in a corduroy suit and string tie.
BARTHOLOMEW'S VOICE: Does the name Tex Penthollow mean anything to you?
REGGIE'S VOICE: No.
BARTHOLOMEW'S VOICE: Next, please.
REGGIE'S VOICE: Yes -- and he was there, too -- a little fatter now -- and less hair -- but it's the same one.
BARTHOLOMEW'S VOICE: Do you know him, Mrs. Vo -- Mrs. Lampert? Leopold W. Gideon?
REGGIE'S VOICE: No.
BARTHOLOMEW'S VOICE: The last one, please.
REGGIE'S VOICE: That's a face you don't forget -- he was there too --
BARTHOLOMEW'S VOICE: Herman Scobie. And you've never seen him before, either?
REGGIE'S VOICE: No, thank heaven.
BARTHOLOMEW: Mrs. Lampert, I'm afraid you're in a great deal of danger.
REGGIE: Danger? Why should I be in any danger?
BARTHOLOMEW: You're Charles Voss's wife -- now that he's dead you're their only lead.
REGGIE: Mr. Bartholomew -- if you're trying to frighten me you're doing a really first-rate job!
BARTHOLOMEW: Please, do what we ask, Mrs. Lampert -- it's your only chance.
REGGIE: Gladly, only I don't know what you want! You haven't told me.
BARTHOLOMEW: Oh, haven't I? The money -- Mrs. Lampert -- the money. The $250,000 Charles Voss received from the auction. Those three men want it, too -- they want it very badly.
REGGIE: But it's Charles's money, not theirs.
BARTHOLOMEW: Oh, Mrs. Lampert! I'd love to see you try and convince them of that! Oh, dear.
REGGIE: Then whose is it? His or theirs?
BARTHOLOMEW: Ours.
REGGIE: Oh, I see.
BARTHOLOMEW: And I'm afraid we want it back.
REGGIE: But I don't have it.
BARTHOLOMEW: That's impossible. You're the only one who could have it.
REGGIE: I'm sorry it's impossible. It's the truth.
BARTHOLOMEW: I believe you.
REGGIE: Thanks very much.
BARTHOLOMEW: Oh, you've got the money all right -- you just don't know you've got it.
REGGIE: Mr. Bartholomew -- if I had a quarter of a million dollars, believe me, I'd know it.
BARTHOLOMEW: Nevertheless, Mrs Lampert -- you've got it.
REGGIE: You mean it's just lying around someplace -- all that cash?
BARTHOLOMEW: Or a safe deposit key, a certified check, a baggage claim -- you look for it, Mrs. Lampert -- I'm quite sure you'll find it.
REGGIE: But --
BARTHOLOMEW: Look for it, Mrs. Lampert -- look just as hard and as fast as you can. You may not have a great deal of time. Those men know you have it just as surely as we do. You won't be safe until the money's in our hands. Is that clear?
BARTHOLOMEW: Here's where you're to call me -- day or night. It's a direct line to both my office and my apartment. Don't lose it, Mrs. Lampert -- and please don't tell anyone about coming to see me. It could prove fatal for them as well as yourself.
REGGIE: Wait a minute -- you think those three men killed Charles, don't you?
BARTHOLOMEW: We've no proof, of course, but we rather think so, yes.
REGGIE: Well, there you are! Charles had the money with him -- so whoever killed him has it -- they have it!
REGGIE: Why not?
BARTHOLOMEW: Because they're still here.
REGGIE: Oh.
BARTHOLOMEW: Like I said, Mrs Lampert -- I'm afraid you're in a great deal of danger. Remember what happened to Charles.
