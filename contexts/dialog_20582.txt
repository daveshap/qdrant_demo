BRITISH AIR COMMANDER: On loan from Colonel Doolittle, is it?
RAFE: That's me, Sir.
BRITISH AIR COMMANDER: Good on you, then, Rafe McCawley. We'll get you situated in some quarters, and then introduce you to the equipment you'll be flying.
RAFE: If you're patching up bullet holes right here on the runway, maybe we should skip the housekeeping and get right to the planes.
BRITISH AIR COMMANDER: Are all the Yanks as anxious as you are to get yourself killed, Lieutenant?
RAFE: Not anxious to die, Sir, anxious to matter.
