Stop letting them rent space in your head.
They don’t deserve to live in your head, kick them out. When you find yourself thinking about them get mad and evict those thoughts. If they don’t bring you joy or a sense of fulfillment, kick it to the curb. You control your happiness and it starts with what you think about.
