PAUL: Um, Libbets. Hey, Dostoyevsky, I'm also really a fan, and what you were saying, you know, have you ever read The Idiot?
LIBBETS: The Idiot?
PAUL: If you liked Notes from Underground, you'll love The Idiot.
LIBBETS: Great, thanks for the tip.
PAUL: The Idiot.
PAUL: I'm in love with Libbets Casey.
MARGE: Yeah, well, you've been in love with like every other girl here, I was wondering when you'd get around to Libbets.
PAUL: It's beyond mere physical attraction.
MARGE: That's good, because I don't think Libbets is capable of the sex act.
PAUL: Truly? Do speak.
MARGE: My diagnosis is messed in the head. A poor little rich girl -- I mean check out the jeans and fur look. And lend your ears to this brutality. Like her mom and step dad and her step-sisters are going to Switzerland to ski over Thanksgiving break -- and like they didn't invite her!
PAUL: How do you know this shit?
MARGE: They did it last year too. It's like traditional or something. They've got this humongoid Park Ave apartment and she just holes up there with a wad of cash. Aren't the hugely wealthy sad?
PAUL: You think Francis is going to beat me to the punch here?
MARGE: Since he sleeps with every girl you ever show an interest in, why don't you just keep your Libbets thing a secret from him?
PAUL: Good thinking Marge.
PAUL: No more man. I'm about to drop as it is.
FRANCIS: See ya.
PAUL: Where you going?
FRANCIS: Paul, let me enlighten you about something. You and I exist on two opposite sides of a great existential divide, that being your pathetic virginity on the one hand and my astonishing number of sexual conquests on the other. I'm off to get laid. See you.
PAUL: Flame on, asshole.
FRANCIS: And remember, with your erogenous zones lubricated as such with the mighty herb, do not attempt terrestrial contact with members of the opposite sex -- because you drone on like a motherfucker when you're stoned.
