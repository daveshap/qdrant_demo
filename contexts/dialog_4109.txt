DIEGO: Please, continue.
GEORGE: We make the pick-up, refuel once more in the Bahamas, and fly back on Sunday with the mom and pop traffic.
CESAR: Why are you speaking?
GEORGE: Excuse me?
CESAR: You. Your responsibility is over. You do not fly. You are not a pilot. You are not a distributor. You introduced us to Mr. Stevens and the use of his airplane. That is all. You make a percentage. A generous one. And you're lucky to get that.
GEORGE: I see. How much?
CESAR: Padrino will pay ten-thousand per kilo. For everyone. For you, and you, and you.
