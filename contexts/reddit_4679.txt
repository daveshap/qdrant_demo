What are things an SO can do to help alleviate your depression?
I am cross posting from r/depression since I am not sure which sub is more appropriate for this 


I have been dating my partner for like four months now. Even though we’ve only been together for a little while I am completely crazy about him. He suffers from MDD and it is so upsetting for me to see such a smart, caring, funny & lovely person being suffocated by chronic feelings of hopelessness. He often jokes about how much he would like to be dead and it’s very hard for me to hear. I wish I could give him some of my own brains happy-chemicals. Seeing him like this makes me want to cry even though I want to be strong for him. I feel scared and anxious that he can’t enjoy our relationship or life as much as I do. I know that I can’t cure his depression but I wanted to ask for advice from other people with depression. What are things that your partner or friends have done that have helped to alleviate your pain or numbness?
