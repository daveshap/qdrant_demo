To those who have “made it”, can you share your background?
Those people who have “made it” in life, a few questions:
1) Your definition of “making it”
2) What do you do? 
3) How much do you make? 
4) How did you get there? (College, mentorship, etc)
5) Biggest piece of advice for those feeling lost (failures and successes along the way)

To expand on #1, everyone’s definition of “making it” is surely different.  In my mind, I will truly have made it when I have a beautiful home, couple new cars, can vacation a few times a year, go to a job that I enjoy where my work has a positive impact, and share all of this with a family.  I have a long way to go to achieve these goals and am looking forward to reading your success stories for motivation.  Thanks!
