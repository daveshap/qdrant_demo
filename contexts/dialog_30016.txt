BOBBY: Time's up. Any last words of wisdom?
BLIND MAN: Things ain't always the way they seem. You got to ask yourself: is it worth it? Day comes Earthmaker is going to look in your fucking heart! Then you better know what it is you're doing. <u>Are you a human being</u> -- or just one of them hungry ghosts out there floatin' around?
BOBBY: You <u>are</u> crazy, you know. Be seeing you, old man.
BLIND MAN: You know I won't be seeing you.
