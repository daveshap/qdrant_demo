What are the facts surrounding the nerve agent use on British soil?
From what I've read, Britain has found that a nerve agent has been used on UK soil that was [discovered/manufactured in the 70s and 80s in the Soviet Union](https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-russia-chemicalweapons-factbo/factbox-a-few-facts-about-the-nerve-agent-novichok-idUKKCN1GO2JR).    
    
Russia has asked for a [sample](https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-britain-russia-deadline/russia-says-is-not-responding-to-british-ultimatum-on-nerve-attack-idUKKCN1GQ010) of the nerve agent before (not) responding to the ultimatum given by Theresa May.    
    
Has there been any statement regarding a sample being delivered to Russia by the UK? Has the UK shown any intention of sending, or not sending, a sample to Russia? What facts do we have that may help us establish an early position on this topic? Have non-UK agencies reviewed the nerve agent yet?
