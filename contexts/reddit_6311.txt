Employee Handbook red flags?
I'm in the process of leaving the job I've had since I was 17, never had another. I just finished e-orientation for taxes and such last night, and I got a digital copy of the new companies employee handbook, which is. Really strict.

The job I'm leaving was pretty lax, the handbook was mostly about behavior on the clock, appearance, and attendance.

In the new company handbook there are clauses about rights to search my personal items, with instant  termination for refusal.

Writeups for foul language. (In a kitchen setting? Are they serious?)

Regulations against drinking alcohol when off duty.

There's some other oddities, but these stuck out the most to me.
Granted I was reading at 1:30 in the morning, and I'll just have to wait and see what's enforced, but are these pretty typical clauses or are they as unusual as they sound?
