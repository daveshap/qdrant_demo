CROW HORSE: You're an easy man to track, Ray. Ya walk like a penguin with a hard-on.
RAY: Is that right? What are the trees saying today?
CROW HORSE: They're sayin' that nobody's gonna talk to you cuz they don't give away one of their own. But they did say there's somebody way across the Little Walking River who wants to talk to you.
CROW HORSE: He sent me to find ya. He says he's got information.
RAY: Let's go.
CROW HORSE: Grandpa Samuel Reaches. Heavy duty medicine.
RAY: Medicine. As in medicine man?
RAY: Why does he wanna see me?
CROW HORSE: Good question. Hardly sees anybody anymore. Hasn't left this place in twenty years. Did you bring some tobacco?
