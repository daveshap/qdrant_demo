KILVARA: Fine -- I've waited over three centuries. I can wait a little longer.
MCCLEOD: Why did you wait?
KILVARA: It was not by choice. A small matter of a mountain falling down on us. We were trapped inside. When the time of the Gathering came the urge to go was so strong we tried to claw through rock with our bare hands. What you thought was the end -- was not. This is the end. We are the last of our kind, Macleod.
MCCLEOD: It will not end tonight.
KILVARA: You cannot hide from me. You will not stand between me and my destiny. After I have your head the power will let me hold any form as long as I want. Do you know what that means? I can become the President -- I can become anyone I want. The world will be mine.
