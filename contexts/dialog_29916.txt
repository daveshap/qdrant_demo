JOHN: Accident.
DARRELL: You got to be more careful. I remember one time--
JOHN: Yeah, right. Someplace in this dust bowl I can get something to drink?
DARRELL: Truck stop up a piece. Not much, but us simple folk like it.
JOHN: I'll be back in a couple of hours. And be careful with her, will you?
DARRELL: Just a car.
