Is there evidence that current laws in South Africa benefit one race over another? Is there current evidence of greater discrimination against one race in South Africa?
To clarify I am speaking of current, post apartheid conditions. I want to better understand race relations as my family is from there and I donâ€™t think I get a neutral stream of info from them.
