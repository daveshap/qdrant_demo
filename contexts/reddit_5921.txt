How do I say no?
Not sure if this is the right spot to post this but I need a bit of help. My boss knows I'm looking for an additional job and today offered me another position with the company. So I would keep my current position, plus take over other duties for more hours. I really don't want this position...how do I respectfully say no? He said I'm his first choice for the job but it really doesn't sit well with me and I'm not that desperate for the money. Im getting by right now but have lots of spare time and would like to be making more money to put away
