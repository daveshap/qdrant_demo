Finally hit 1k!
This week I got paid as usual. What's not usual is that the $187.50 I put into my new(ish) savings account. Putting me to $965(ok not quite 1k sue me). I'm incredibly excited to be finally saving and being financially intelligent/sound. Reddit has helped me so much, thank you all. Just last year at this time I had no retirement, no savings, no money, and no plan. That's all changed because I was able to learn. So again thank you all.

Edit:words

Edit: Sidenote lol I also hit my 1k karma savings as well for the first time. Thanks for the upvotes people. Wish I had joined reddit sooner!

Edit:more words and some formatting.

Edit: shamefully more words.

Edit: just put the 36.67 into the account to officially be 1k!

Edit: almost 1k upvotes haha thanks I never imagined this. You guys rock and have made this a special day.
