CAPTAIN HENDERSON: Now, Mack, what's the situation?
JOHNNY MACK: I'm not entirely certain, Captain. You'll have to see for yourself.
CAPTAIN HENDERSON: That's not Fred Madison?
JOHNNY MACK: No, sir, it's not.
CAPTAIN HENDERSON: Who is it?
JOHNNY MACK: I couldn't say, sir... Captain Henderson?
CAPTAIN HENDERSON: Yeah, Mack?
JOHNNY MACK: Captain... this is some spooky shit we got here.
WARDEN: Repeat that, Bill.
CAPTAIN HENDERSON: Warden, it's not him. It was not Fred Madison in that cell.
WARDEN: Of course, it's Madison!!! Who else could it be?
CAPTAIN HENDERSON: I don't know. The guards say they've never seen him before.
WARDEN: Where is he now?
CAPTAIN HENDERSON: He's in the infirmary, being examined.
WARDEN: Did you ask him who he is?
CAPTAIN HENDERSON: He... He can't talk. it appears as if he can't talk, anyway.
WARDEN: If he's not Madison, then where's Madison?
CAPTAIN HENDERSON: I've got men searching the building and the grounds now.
