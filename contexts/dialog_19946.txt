BALLARD: I questioned Joyce about all this...
ROY: Yeah?
BALLARD: Seems she was pretty familiar with 'ol Del. On a regular basis, if you get my drift...
ROY: ...and half the other guys in this town. Including you, I believe...
BALLARD: Junior year!
ROY: Anyway, so what?
BALLARD: So? ...Suppose Betty found out about them?
ROY: You said a woman couldn't have done it.
BALLARD: A woman can write a check.
ROY: So you're saying Betty Sizemore -- our Betty Sizemore -- who you were in swing choir with -- has now hired somebody to scalp her husband in her own kitchen while she watched? You're amazing.
BALLARD: 'S just a theory... just 'cause I'm thinking it don't mean I like it.
BALLARD: How is she?
DOCTOR: She's in a kind of shock. I see all the signs of a post-traumatic reaction with possible dissociative symptoms.
BALLARD: Could I have that in American?
DOCTOR: It's a type of altered state... it allows a traumatized person to continue functioning.
BALLARD: So she did witness it?
ROY: Oh, you're sharp as a tack, Elden.
BALLARD: That's it! YOU'RE GONE!
ROY: Oww, the arm, the arm!
BALLARD: You just don't know when to quit, Roy! You were jealous of me when I got hall monitor in seventh grade, and you're still jealous now!!!
ROY: One question, Doctor, please! You can't do this! I'm the press, I have rights!!
BALLARD: That's right, you have the right to remain silent.
BALLARD: Sorry you had to see that. You were saying?
DOCTOR: I was saying that it seems probable that she witnessed the murder, but her memory of it is gone, at least for the time being. I also think you ought to have her stay with someone tonight. Any idea who Chloe or Lonnie are?
BALLARD: No... Friends from the diner maybe?
DOCTOR: Well, you should find out. She keeps talking about them...
SUE ANN: Let me know if you need anything, okay?
BETTY: Are you and Larry happy?
SUE ANN: Oh, I dunno... enough, I s'pose.
BETTY: Then you should treasure that... you gotta hold on to whatever you got that's any good, even if it's only a little bit.
SUE ANN: All you been through... I ever tell you what a good friend you are?
BETTY: All the time...
SUE ANN: Well, you are.
BETTY: Something bad happened to Del and me, didn't it?
SUE ANN: Yeah, hon. Real bad. You just get some sleep, everything's gonna be fine.
BETTY: Sue Ann, I'm sorry about all this, but I just know there's something special out there for me...
