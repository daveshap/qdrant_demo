Is it normal to just not know what you want to do?

So much of my career is based on impulse. I have a general sense of where I want to go, but lots of anxiety about where I don't. Most people seem to be set in their career, they want to be an actor, doctor, lawyer, here I am - a rift raft in the water, not sure what to do, where to go, and unsure of myself.   


I mean, is this a normal feeling to not know what you're doing half the time?
