PARRISH: -- And call my family, I'd like them to come over for dinner tonight.
JENNIFER: Didn't the family get together last night --?
PARRISH: Jennifer.
JENNIFER: Of course, Mr. Parrish. Right away.
PARRISH: Perhaps you would like to wait in my office --?
JOE: No.
PARRISH: What I'm trying to say is this is a Board meeting and you are not a mem- ber of the Board.
JOE: I'm sure you'll see to it that it won't be a problem.
