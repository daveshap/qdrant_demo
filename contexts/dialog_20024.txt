PETE: The preacher said it absolved us.
EVERETT: For him, not for the law! I'm surprised at you, Pete. Hell, I gave you credit for more brains than Delmar.
DELMAR: But there were witnesses, saw us redeemed!
EVERETT: That's not the issue, Delmar. Even if it did put you square with the Lord, the State of Mississippi is more hardnosed.
DELMAR: You should a joined us, Everett. It couldn't a hurt none.
PETE: Hell, at least it woulda washed away the stink of that pomade.
EVERETT: Join you two ignorant fools in a ridiculous superstition? Thank you anyway. And I like the smell of my hair treatment - the pleasing odor is half the point.
EVERETT: Baptism. You two are just dumber'n a bag of hammers. Well, I guess you're my cross to bear-
DELMAR: Pull over, Everett - let's give that colored boy a lift.
