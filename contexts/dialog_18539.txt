VICTORIA: What are those?
BROWN: What?
VICTORIA: Those, over there, there.
BROWN: Craobhan-geanmchno-fhiadhaich.
VICTORIA: Craobhan-geanmchno... How can I possibly say that with a straight face?!
VICTORIA: I am thinking of publishing my Highland Journals.""
BROWN: Are they worth reading?
VICTORIA: I am told so.
BROWN: Who by?
VICTORIA: Sir Henry Ponsonby tells me they are charming.
BROWN: What does he know about the Highlands?
VICTORIA: He has been attending at Balmoral for many years.
BROWN: That doesn't make him an expert.
VICTORIA: His remarks were directed at the quality of the writing, not its subject.
BROWN: I don't groom a horse to have it admired by others, I groom it because it needs grooming.
VICTORIA: I do not do it for others. But Ponsonby thinks they are good.
BROWN: Just say what you have to say, woman. What other people think shouldn't matter to you.
VICTORIA: Of course I shall say what I have to say. I always do.
BROWN: Aye, well, if all you want is a good opinion then he'd be sure to oblige you.
VICTORIA: What Mr Ponsonby was appreciating was their literary merit, a skill not intimately associated with the knowledge of grooming. Literary appreciation does not begin and end with Tennyson.
