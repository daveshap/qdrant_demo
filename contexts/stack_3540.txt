Can a hacker hack into port 80? We normally say port 80 is firewall friendly.But can a hacker just hack into port 80 via TCP or UDP?Or is Port 80 by default not always open? It waits for the host to initiate a connection via specific application/service to a host application then the port is opened at that time?Is a hacker required to fake that specific host application in order to hack into our computer?
