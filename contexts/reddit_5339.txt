Are there jobs that do not require productivity standards or a productivity log?
had a full-time job that required very unreasonable productivity standards.Meaning I had to produce a certain amount of something in a day or week or month.And if I fell below that they'd write me up. I'm one of those people that has a hard time staying on task. Especially if I hate the job. I really really hated this job. It paid well at least for my situation it was about 30k a year. But the stress that was put upon me by this job gave me health problems and it was a very physically demanding job the repetitive nature of the job really drove me crazy. And hurt my body.

It kind of burnt me out so much that I've been unemployed for about a year-and-a-half I'm afraid even apply for a new job because I'm afraid they're all going to be like that job.I mean they would yell at me and say I was wasting time when I was trying to ask them a question. I can't work those kind of places. I guess my conscientiousness is not very good.

I have a bachelor's degree in history with a minor in business administration. I had a GPA of 3.7.

I just want to know if there's a job out there that has decent pay it does not require production standards and activity logs that keep track of your activities that you do through the day?
