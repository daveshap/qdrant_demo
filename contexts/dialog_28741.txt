CROW HORSE: The old man saw an owl. Over there in the dry wash. Last week.

CROW HORSE: The owl is a messenger. When one shows itself to a Sioux... it means someone's gonna die. The owl told him about Leo.

RAY: Listen to the water. Listen to the owl. He also said, don't trust the fucking Cookie Monster.
