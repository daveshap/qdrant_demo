What evidence is there, for or against claims of a U.S. backed coup/regime change in countries such as Bolivia and Venenzuela?
This week, Bolivia [ousted its President, Evo Morales](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-50370013) after claims of voting irregularities in the recent election.

There were claims from [Morales](https://twitter.com/evoespueblo/status/1194361059479576577), and his [supporters](https://www.salon.com/2019/11/12/global-left-condemns-appalling-bolivia-coup-as-evo-morales-forced-from-power/) that this was a coup, at least [influenced, if not backed by U.S. forces](https://www.globalresearch.ca/us-coup-plot-oust-bolivia-evo-morales/5694446). They say that the military and police leaders had sided with the U.S. in their efforts to force "regime change". Morales has said that he was forced to resign after being [shown a bounty by a member of his military](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/12/evo-morales-arrives-mexico-bolivia-power-vacuum)

Currently, the acting President [is from the opposition party, and has been recognised by the U.S. as legitimate,](https://sputniknews.com/world/201911131077295232-us-state-department-recognises-anez-interim-president-of-bolivia/) however Morales' party have said ["sheâ€™s declared herself president without having a quorum in the parliament"](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/nov/12/evo-morales-arrives-mexico-bolivia-power-vacuum) and called the session illegal.

The U.S. has said that he was not [forced out by a coup.](https://apnews.com/3886ecb25be54066a393c40dec81e384)

In neighbouring Venezuela, President Maduro has also called this activity in Bolivia a [coup](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-bolivia-election-latam/venezuelas-maduro-condemns-coup-against-bolivian-ally-morales-idUSKBN1XK0NW). He, himself, has been targets of previous [so-called coup attempts](https://www.salon.com/2019/05/08/failed-venezuela-coup-was-fake-news-designed-to-fool-people-in-two-nations/) which he accuses the U.S. of backing, and has also accused the global effort to recognise [Juan Guaido as leader of Venezuala](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-48781652) as undermining his power. Guaido has said that [it was not a coup.](https://qz.com/1609198/venezuela-is-it-a-coup/)

Guaido is an [elected official, head of the Venezuelan legislature](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/15/juan-guaido-venezuelan-opposition-leader-challenging-maduros-rule), and claimed executive power after the [controversial 2019 elections](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-36319877), in which the opposition refused to accept the results on grounds of unfair elections.

The U.S has long acknowledged that it [seeked regime changes in countries which it views as necessary](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/19/cia-admits-role-1953-iranian-coup), and has a [long history of doing so](https://www.globalresearch.ca/overthrowing-other-peoples-governments-the-master-list-of-u-s-regime-changes/5400829), [whether or not it has fully publicly stated it has done so.](https://jia.sipa.columbia.edu/online-articles/american-covert-regime-change-operations-cold-war-war-terror)

What merit do the claims that the US is currently employed in so-called regime changes/coups in countries such as Bolivia and Venezuela? Are these claims in any way subjective?
