I'm not ok.
I'm not ok.  I tell my family, friends, and coworkers I am, but I am not ok.  Six months ago my entire future disappeared and what was left in its place was a quivering mess of anxiety, fear, and depression. I get up every day and act like everything is ok, but I'm not ok.

I don't want my teenage son to see how painful relationships can end so I say I'm ok.  I don't want my daughter to worry about me so I smile and say I'm ok.  I don't want my ex to think I'm weak so I say things are good and that I'm ok.  I don't want my family to pity me so I tell them life happens and I'm ok.  

But I'm not ok... and that's ok.

Because I will be ok again one day.  This isn't my first relationship to end.  This isn't the first time I've been here.  This isn't the first time I've felt like this.  I survived all of those, I'll survive this.  As long as I draw breath there's hope.  

And because I have hope, I'll be ok.
