TAXI DRIVER: Miss, would I be prying?
JENNIE: Everything is wrong.
TAXI DRIVER: No, not everything? The sun is still shinning. It's a beautiful day out. Some things are OK. Right?
JENNIE: Yeah, I guess so.
TAXI DRIVER: Did you and your boyfriend just break up?
JENNIE: No.
TAXI DRIVER: Are you in trouble with the law?
JENNIE: No.
TAXI DRIVER: Am I getting warm?
TAXI DRIVER: Now that's it. A smile. You look like a prom queen when you smile. Like a glamour girl.
JENNIE: Yeah?
TAXI DRIVER: Oh yeah, sure. When I was a kid I had a crush on the prom queen. Darlene Louis. She had a big black mole in the center of her face that used to get me so excited. Darlene Louis. You know you look a little bit like her.
JENNIE: Thanks.
TAXI DRIVER: Yeah. Right around the cheeks and chin. Boy did I have a crush on her. She was the first girl I ever put my tongue in her mouth.
