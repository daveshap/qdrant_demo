FRY: No, no, I wanted to get away.
JOHNS: So I noticed. Never seen a captain" quite so ready to leave her ship."
FRY: Better keep moving....
JOHNS: What'd Owens mean? 'Bout not touching the switch?
JOHNS: Hey. You can tell me, Carolyn.
FRY: Promise me. Swear to me you won't --
JOHNS: You see anybody else here? Just between you and me.
FRY: During the landing...when things were at their worst...Owens was at his best. He's the one who wouldn't let the pilot dump the passenger cabin.
FRY: So now you know.
JOHNS: Fuck. Guess I'm more glad to be here than I thought.
