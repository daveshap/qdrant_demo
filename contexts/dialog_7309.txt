NICK: How's the trailer?
LINDA: Great. Fine... Once or twice it did fall off the blocks. I don't know what that's from.
NICK: Frost.
LINDA: Is that what it is? I couldn't figure out.
NICK: Did you get hurt? You didn't get hurt?
LINDA: Oh, no. It just kind of goes thump. Would you like a Coke? You don't drink Coke. Or maybe you do. What about champagne? Let's have champagne! I don't think we have champagne. Let's have this. See? Sparkling. I'll get you an opener. Oh, that's right. No opener. Let's just have beer. Do you want some cheese? Or maybe eggs? Maybe we should have coffee.
