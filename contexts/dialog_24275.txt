KAREN: Hey Frank. You shouldn't be coming over here. My parents really don't want you to.
FRANK: I wanted to bring you some flowers. They're pretty good ones.
KAREN: They're from the Dollar Store. I'm not an idiot. Besides we have a garden full of flowers.
FRANK: I wanted for you to meet Karl, too. He's my new friend. But I feel like I've always known him. I thought you should meet him.
KAREN: Why? Hi, Karl.
FRANK: He's gonna be around a lot and I hope you are too, so...
KAREN: Here give me the flowers, I'll do something with them. Thank you. Now you better go. Maybe I'll see you down at the secret place one day in a week or two or something. I have a boyfriend now you know. And we're pretty serious. He gave me a ring.
FRANK: Can you go there with us now? Me and Karl. We could just hang out. Karl has some cool books.
KAREN: Frank, I just like you as a friend. Only at the secret place. Okay? I can't go there now. I'll see you later.
FRANK: But maybe just for awhile --
KAREN: I'm closing the door now. I told you, I'll see you later.
FRANK: She said she'd see me later. That's kinda good, right?
KARL: I reckon.
