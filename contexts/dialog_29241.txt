SUZIE: I have someone I want you to meet.
HARRY: I'll be right there.
HATTIE: I couldn't believe it when Suzie called and said you were staying here. How have you been?
HARRY: Girl, do you still sing and dance?
HATTIE: No, I'm a different person now, Harry.
GIDEON: Haven't the years been good to Hattie?
HARRY: It hasn't been the years; it's been the men in her life.
HATTIE: Harry, that's not nice. I'm in church now.
HARRY: Why run out and close the barn door when the horse is gone? I remember when you weren't saved. That was way back yonder when the Natchez Trace was just a dirt road.
HATTIE: Some people grow up and change their ways.
HARRY: I know your mother ain't still operating that house of hers.
HATTIE: My mother passed on years ago.
