Anyone in the UIUC online Aero MS
I was recently accepted in to the program and was hoping to connect with someone that is currently a student or an alumni. I’d like to get someone’s opinion on how the online delivery is handled and how interesting the classes are. My other choice is USC but they seem to have a smaller selection of courses.
