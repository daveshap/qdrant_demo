Hookup culture sucks
How do you guys do it. I’m a young woman in my early 20s and not into hookups and I realize I might be in the minority, but how do you deal with dating when all guys wanna do is hookup. 

I went on a date with a guy who I matched with on a dating app told him I wasn’t into hookups and sure enough when I told him I wasn’t into hookups he kicked me out (in hindsight the fact that we were meeting up at his place to go hotubbing is a sign I missed) but still I don’t do hookups due to reasons, for other young women my age who don't do hookups how do you manage with the fact that all guys want to do is hookup.

I feel like I’m gonna be alone forever for not hooking up but I shouldn’t have to hookup to get a boyfriend it’s so frustrating.

Edit: For those telling me to not online date it’s not just online dating. I’ve met guys through bars, parties, buses, park and most want to hook up from the chad type to the nice guy type. The ones who don’t are taken or gay lol.

Apparently someone linked this to the MGTOW sub 🤷🏾‍♀️
