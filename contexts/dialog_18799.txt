MATTHEW: Is it over ?
BRUCE: Almost. Look, you two get out of here.
MATTHEW: Where ?
BRUCE: In the jail cell is a spiral staircase. It leads to the surface. Take it all the way up.
SAUNDRA: What about you ?
BRUCE: There's one more person here for me to visit.
MATTHEW: It's that asshole Zach isn't it ?
SAUNDRA: Zach from work ?
BRUCE: He's the liaison for McCay. Listen go. Go now.
MATTHEW: Don't have to tell me twice.
SAUNDRA: Just stop it. End it here.
BRUCE: It'll end. It'll end with him and McCay. Then the park shuts down. Permanently.
