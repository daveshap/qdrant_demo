FRANCIS: What the hell took you so long?
LOGAN: Did you ever see anybody renew?
FRANCIS: I think you've been skulling out too much. First Nursery and now stupid questions.

LOGAN: Anybody we know?
FRANCIS: Look... why don't you get into the water... you need it... more than I do.
LOGAN: I'm fine... See you...
FRANCIS: At Carousel tonight?
