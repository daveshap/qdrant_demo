Best field of medical technology to study in?
I was speaking about the future of medicine with a patient and he brought up how the medical field is using more technology and ai while diagnosing and treating patients. This lit a spark in me and now I am driven to start studying it and building a career around it. however when i looked up programs for it there are so many options that it is kind of hard to narrow down exactly which path I want to proceed down. 

Right now I am a medical assistant working in a pain management clinic and have been for the past 5 years. I have gained a bit of knowledge and experience in this field so Anesthesiology tech would probably make the most sense but I would also love to learn more about bio tech.

In your opinions what would be the path that would provide the most growth and/or be the most interesting to study?
