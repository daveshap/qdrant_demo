FRANCES: Doctor, it may sound odd, but I believe I've profited from my stay here. It's just what I've needed, to get away like this. But I'm recuperated now. I've had lots of time to think and I've made a few decisions about my life. I'm ready to get on with it.
DOYLE: I know you believe that.
FRANCES: ...Don't you?
DOYLE: I'm afraid not. You see, we observe things that you're unaware of: signs, indicators. Your problem cuts very deep, Frances, and we have to get at that deeper stuff so that when you do get out, you'll really feel secure. Does that make sense?
FRANCES: No. Cut this runaround, Doctor. I know better.
DOYLE: Listen to yourself, Frances. The resistance, the anger in your voice.
FRANCES: You... I'm sorry, forgive me. Doctor, tell me honestly, what do I have to do to get out of here?
DOYLE: Be patient, that's all. Take an interest in your treatment and don't dwell on your resentments. You'll be yourself again, I assure you.
FRANCES: ...I see.
DOYLE: We'll talk more about this. I'll see you later.
FRANCES: One question. If I'm not myself now, just who do you think I am?
