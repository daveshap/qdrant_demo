Girls that date down confuse and infuriate me.
Preface: I'm a five, six on a good day. I'm just on that side of being a short guy (5' 6"), but of an acceptable weight, no deformities. I'm alright, not great. I'm affable, generous, respectful, and all that other stuff, yet I've been shot down for being short (And informed so) on SEVERAL occasions without anybody ever getting to know me.

So when I see a really really attractive girl who's dating, say, a giant balding fat guy with greasy hair and skin and a neckbeard, it really bothers me. It's like, how did that happen? What happened that this friggin guy pulled that off and I can't find ANYBODY? 

Even Hitler had a girlfriend.

And that's what's bothering me.
