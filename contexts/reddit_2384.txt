Is there no place for employees that are just “pretty good” at their jobs?
Is there no room for employees that are “pretty good” at their jobs?

For context, I work in advertising in New York. 

I’ve been in this industry about three years and I’ve basically learned there’s no place for people who want to show up every day and do their job because work is a necessity and you have to do what you have to do in life but without letting it consume you. Everywhere I’ve worked my employer seems to feel like it’s reasonable to expect the entire workforce to be hyper-career oriented, workaholic, type A people who don’t value anything in life higher than their job.

It’s not enough to do your job because it’s your job, you have to keep a facade of passion and believing in the company’s mission and shit and this is 100% expected to be your entire life. Imperfection equates to total failure and being a “pretty good” employee gets you fired. 

Is it even possible to find a job where you’re not surrounded by miserable work-addicted people who expect you to be the same? I’ve been thinking about a career change but I’m afraid it’ll be the same no matter where I am.
