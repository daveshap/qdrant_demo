JIM KURRING: Well.
CLAUDIA: That felt good to do...to do what I wanted to do.
JIM KURRING: Yeah.
CLAUDIA: Can I tell you something?
JIM KURRING: Yeah, of course.
CLAUDIA: I'm really nervous that you're gonna hate me soon. That you're gonna find stuff out about me and you're gonna hate me --
JIM KURRING: -- no, like what, what do you mean?
CLAUDIA: You're a police officer. You have so much, so many good things and you seem so together...so all straight and put together without problems.
JIM KURRING: I lost my gun.
CLAUDIA: What?
JIM KURRING: I lost my gun after I left you today and I'm the laughing stock of a lot of people. I wanted to tell you that. I wanted you to know...and it's on my mind and it makes me look like a fool and I feel like a fool and you asked that we should say things, that we should say what we're thinknig and not lie about things and I'll tell you that, this: that I lost my gun and I'm not a good cop...and I'm looked down at...and I know that....and I'm scared that once you find that out you might not like me.
CLAUDIA: Oh my god, Jim. Jim, that was so --
JIM KURRING: I'm sorry --
CLAUDIA: That was so great what you just said.
JIM KURRING: I haven't been on a date since I was married and that was three years ago....and Claudia...whatever you wanna tell me, whatever you think might scare me, won't...and I will listen...I will be a good listener to you if that's what you want...and you know, you know...I won't judge you.... I can do that sometimes, I know, but I won't...I can...listen to you and you shouldn't be scared of scaring me off or anything that you might think I'll think or on and on and just say it and I'll listen to you....
CLAUDIA: You don't how fuckin' stupid I am.
JIM KURRING: It's ok.
CLAUDIA: You don't know how crazy I am.
JIM KURRING: It's ok.
CLAUDIA: I've got troubles.
JIM KURRING: I'll take everything at face value. I'll be a good listener to you.
CLAUDIA: Ohhhh I started this, didn't I, didn't I, didn't I, fuck.
JIM KURRING: Say what you want and you'll see --
CLAUDIA: Wanna kiss me, Jim?
JIM KURRING: Yes I do.
