VIRGINIA: Here's the list of all Sheldon's credit charges. Nothing after the Silver Creek. Any calls?
BUSTER: Just from his agent.
ANNIE: What are you doing on the floor? It's my fault. If I'd had a proper hospital bed, this never would have happened. Here, let me help you back in. I know this hurts, but it'll only take a few seconds. There you go. Comfy?
PAUL: Perfect.
ANNIE: You're such a kidder. I have a big surprise for you. But first there's something you must do.
PAUL: I don't suppose I could have a little snack while I wait for the surprise?
ANNIE: I'll get you everything you want, but you must listen first. Sometimes my thinking is a little muddy, I accept that. It's why I couldn't remember all those things they were asking me on the witness stand in Denver.
ANNIE: But this time I thought clearly. I asked God about you and God said I delivered him unto you so that you may show him the way.""
PAUL: Show me the way?
ANNIE: Yes.
