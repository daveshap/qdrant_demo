I cannot get a job (engineering student) and I’m starting to panic about my future.
I’m an international student about to complete a B.S in Chemical Engineering from one of the top programs in the US. I’ve been here since early high school thanks to extended family and this place has become my home. My grades are excellent and I’ll be graduating with honors. I’ve worked where I could while studying (internship at tech company, customer service at school, 4 semesters of paid research at school and we’re getting published). Got my resume reviewed over and over again at school provided career and success events, I’ve also gone to advising in my department and career centers, gone to every career fair, applied to so many jobs and talked to so many recruiters. All I get are automated rejection emails. One after another. Week after week. I have one semester left to graduate and try to stay with OPT. Before I came to the US I lived in a place I did not fit in, with people who rejected me. My family is very traditional and I do not want to return to the confines of their life. I’ve been working so hard, but I can’t make it. I don’t know what I’m doing wrong. My friends, my love, my real family is now in the US, where I struggle to anchor myself. I’m desperate and so afraid I’ll fail. Please help me if you have any insight. Thanks guys. 

I’m sorry for the lack of detail on many parts as I’m trying to preserve some anonymity.
