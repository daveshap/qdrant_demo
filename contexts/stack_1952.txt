Adjective for \"relating to a whole\"? I am trying to find an adjective or word that describes something that is relative/responsive to a larger whole. The context I am interested is in music, e.g. a musical part  in a song that is is particularly responsive to the other parts in the song. To give a better idea, I have a good example word for the opposite idea. An idiosyncratic guitar part in song, would be a part that sounds fairly disjunct with other parts, not naturally relating with them and starkly stands out as it's \"own thing\". But what is an antonym for \"idiosyncratic\" in this context?The word I'm looking for is one which explains said musical part as in it's nature as an entity rather than an aesthetic, for instance \"conjunctive\" springs to mind, yet this would fall to much in the latter category
