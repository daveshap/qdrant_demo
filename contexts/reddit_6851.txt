They wanted to lay me off, now they want me to change teams. Does this mean I am safe?
Hi everyone. I started my current (and first) job two years ago. I work in a small department highly specialized. I’m a junior and there are two account directors, let’s call them Frank and Grace. 
According to my manager (one of my directors, Frank), there are things I did very well but one specific task that was impossible for me to success at. Over the years, my inability to perform this task became a major weak points in my evaluations.
Then my manager Frank quit, which made the other director Grace the sole decision-maker in our small team. Now at the head of our department (again, just the two of us), she decided she wanted a change because I was unable to perform that specific task, making her job difficult. So we started talking about lay offs, how they wanted to part from me and recruit someone else.

Then covid happened. We were all working from home and the HR director told me that they decided against laying me off considering the climate (which is incredible). She told me we’d talk about the lay off once everyone was back at the office with the covid under control.

Then last week, Grace, now my manager, told me they had discussions about me with the higher ups and they thought it would be a good move for to change teams and do other tasks. She told me I would remain working with her but I would also work on some other stuff that she thinks I’m good at. 
In order to make it even more official, they changed my manager. I’m still working for Grace but my manager will be someone else.

When I asked Grace why they would move me to another team if I was going to leave in a few months, she said ‘think of it as trying to find a better fit for you’

Does this mean they’re not going through with the lay off and I’m safe?
