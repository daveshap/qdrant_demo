Tomorrow I go back to being alone and miserable
I've been on a month long trip with friends, and it's been great, but tonight is our last night. They're all looking forward to returning to their family and partners, and I'm just dreading it. 

I live significantly further away than the rest, so can only see them once or twice a year, and my social life back home is non existent. I know I shouldn't be selfish, but my heart is legitimately breaking at the thought of having to go back to my normal life.
