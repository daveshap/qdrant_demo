Getting a job in HR with a strategic communications degree
Okay this is for any HR people in here. So I currently work in marketing. I'm a recent graduate, and have a  degree in strategic communications. At my last internship I had such a  good experience with the HR department throughout my time there, and I  liked hearing about what they did. My sister also works in HR and has  great stories (and some not so great of course) but she gets to help a  lot of people. Would I need a degree specifc to HR to get a job as a  recruiter or the like, or could I swing it with a communications degree?
