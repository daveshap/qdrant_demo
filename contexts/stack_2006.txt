Hypernym for individuals, organizations, possibly other things I'm building a budgeting database application/program and I'm looking for two words as names of tables or variables in it.  This question seeks one of them:It encompasses the following:  The table in question (that I'm looking for the name to call it) will (currently) hold 5 records: a record for myself, one for my wife, and one each for each of our three businesses.  But that list might change when say our son grows up and becomes another record in this table, or we start another business, or whatever.Some databases text books etc. suggest the word \"parties\" for entities like this, but I find that word too generic.  I'm hoping to find something a little less vague, but also not quite the mouthful \"PeopleAndOrganizations\" might be. lol.I'd welcome and be grateful for any suggestions!Edit/update:  As Roger Sinasohn pointed out in the comments for my other similar question: yes, I'm looking for a countable noun.An example sentence could be where I click a button to delete a bunch of these records, and need to pop up a confirmation warning first: \"Do you really want to delete these whatevers?\"I'd really rather not have to say \"Do you really want to delete these people and organisations?\" or whatever.It doesn't have to be one word.  eg. another question asked for a hypernym for anywhere that serves food (restaurant, cafe, fast-food place, etc.).  If that's what I was looking for here, then \"eating establishment\" might be ok.  But if more than one word, it can't just be a string of all the words I'm trying to find the hypernym for (people and organisations).
