$1000 & $500 Emergency UBI
Please help write a letter to your Congressperson right now, asking them to co-sponsor H.Res.897, to ensure a basic income cash transfer to each citizen of the United States is part of the stimulus package.

This link will automatically write the letter for you and find your congressperson near your home address. This universal basic income bill will provide every American adult with $1000 per month and additional $500 per child under the age of 18. Think about the amount of working class people this will help. My parents are out of work because of COVID 19 and this will immensely help pay their essentials like rent and food.
