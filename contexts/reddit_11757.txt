The corporate world is nasty.
This year I’ve learnt that cheaters actually do win. Hard work gets you nowhere. Especially if you refuse to give in to your boss of the opposite gender whose advances you’ve ignored from day 1. I’ve seen coworkers steal information and take all the credit. I’ve seen coworkers be wrongfully applauded for work they didn’t do. I’ve seen coworkers in a lower position than me get handed better opportunities and move past me and then been told that I’m not capable enough (believe me, that’s not true). I’ve seen other coworkers put up with this shit because there is no alternative. I’ve seen awards and rewards go to people who don’t deserve them and have had it dangled in my face. I’ve seen coworkers lie to make themselves seem hard working. I’ve seen it all. I could write for days about the injustice. And it bothers me at my very core because for years, bit by bit, day by day, I’ve had my spirit crushed and my self-confidence destroyed all because I refuse to give in to pervert who is threatened by my ability to surpass them. 

And I’m only 25. 

Sorry for the rant, But thank you for reading.
