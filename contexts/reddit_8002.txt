What is your favorite search tool for scholarships/grants/fellowships?
Hello friends!

So I've been out of undergrad for about three years, and I have wanted to go to graduate school for a long time but I've been reluctant to leave my job and its steady income. I applied as a non-degree student for this coming fall so that if I did decide to quit, I could have the option to start taking classes in August while I work on my full application. Today things really started hitting the fan at work and I had to be like, yeah, okay, I have to get outta dodge ASAP. I plan to quit at the end of June, or maybe a couple of months earlier if things continue to be horribly mismanaged.

I just sat down and ran the numbers on how much it would cost me over two years with tuition and living without an income, which then led me to discover that it seems like no one wants to fund masters degree students. My school has some fellowship and graduate assistantship opportunities, but I've spoken with the financial aid office and it sounds like they're almost always swept up by incoming fall students. I'm fine with just paying sticker price for my first semester as a non-degree student, but since I would technically be starting in spring I'm trying to find whatever sources I can so that I can be ready when I'm submitting my full application.

Masters students in particular, but others if you have good resources, what's the best search tools or listings you know of that show you good funding opportunities and applications? I'd rather stay away from loans if possible. I signed up for the Sallie Mae scholarship search tool thing but I'm wondering if there's any insider resources to be had. I'm looking to study history, if that affects anything. Thank you!
