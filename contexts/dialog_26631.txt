MITCHELL: They work for the people we're trying to sue. Their job is to try to minimize damages. Our job, Nicole, is to try to maximize them. You have to think of it that way. As people doing their jobs. No good guys or bad guys. Just our side and their side.
NICOLE: I won't lie.
MITCHELL: I don't want you to lie.
NICOLE: The truth is that it was an accident, and no one's to blame.
MITCHELL: There's no such thing as an accident, Nicole. Not in a situation like this.
NICOLE: You seem very sure about that.
MITCHELL: I'm absolutely positive.
