The thought of being in a relationship opens the floodgates of negative emotions.
I've dating and had a few relationships before, but I've been single for about 10 months I guess.  
Since the last relationship I've tried dating, but it hasn't worked out.

But I've developed, sort of by accident, an almost-dating relationship with someone.  
We spend a lot of time together (2-3 days a week), we go out to eat every other week, we're close intellectually and at times physically - but the concept of us "dating" or being in a "relationship" does come up directly.

But when I think about us being together, and all that would come with that, I feel just horrible in ways that are hard for me to put into words.
