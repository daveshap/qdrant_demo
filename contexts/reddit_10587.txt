I understand suicide now. Trust me, it's not a choice. It's an action.
I was abused last year, and I've paid dearly for it. Pretty much with my life. The same people who didn't understand me when I called for help, blamed it on me. Everything has been taken away from me, including my dignity and personality. People help you but they get tired and then they think you're a liar. 

I just want to say that if you're out there, and you've had suicidal thoughts, I totally understand. I get it now. I believe that those who suicide are too pure for this world. The most beautiful souls don't fit in here. It's always the good ones that suffer.

I'm with you. Just know that I know. I know that feeling. The world thinks it understands, but it doesn't. I'm there with you in this moment, in that feeling you have. In the pain. In the misunderstanding, in the absense of justice. I don't have an answer and I don't have any comforting words, but I'm with you.
