My employer-to-be sent me my first project weeks before I start.
  
I am currently an engineer at a company where I feel no growth or challenge.

I interviewed as a junior engineer with a company in California USA (I'm moving from a different city in CA) that I am really excited about. There is alot to be learned there. We settled on a salary and they are preparing me an offer that should be delivered in the next few days. Once that comes, I plan to put in my 2 weeks.

Today, my new company sent me my first project out of the blue. \[Mind you, I haven't even gotten an official offer letter yet. I don't start for 3 more weeks.\] The VP of Engineering sent me details of the project, who to coordinate with, expectations, etc. They said that this is urgent and extremely important for an expo they have coming up.

I asked them what is the start date of this project? They said "We would like you to work on this officially once you start on 1/7. However if you have spare time now, you are welcome to work on it to get a head start. This project is a backup solution for our main project for \[expo\] which is extremely important for the company."

How would you feel? What would you do? I have a full time job so I can't imagine working for no pay on a project in my free time for a company who hasn't sent me an offer letter. Is this a red flag?

Also, note that I feel it was tough for me to land a position I was this excited about.
