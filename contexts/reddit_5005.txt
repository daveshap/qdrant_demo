I can't get out of bed.
If this sounds familiar, please share your tips/success stories. I need all the advice I can get.

I don't have any friends. I work a dead end job because I don't have any valuable skills. I don't have any hobbies, though I've attempted lots of things, only to lose interest. All I do besides work is binge eat and watch Netflix. I do have a loving husband who wants to help me, but doesn't know how. Now it's my day off and I'm still in bed at 2 because I don't see a reason to get up. I hate living like this.
