AARON: He excels at gratitude.
TOM: Are you any closer to a decision?
JANE: I think so...They've been talking to me about being Tom's Managing Editor.
AARON: Really?
JANE: I'm going to take it.
TOM: What a great surprise. I didn't think we had a chance. I heard you wanted to stay in Washington.
JANE: Well, there's a guy, but he says he'll fly up a lot.
TOM: Well, we should talk. You going to have time for dinner? I'd like you to meet Lila.
JANE: I'm sorry because I was looking forward to that, but I' m going back in a few hours.
TOM: Okay...It's so good to see you.
TOM: It's nice to see you.
AARON: Congratulations on history's longest winning streak.
TOM: If you ever get restless in Portland, let me know.
AARON: Why?
