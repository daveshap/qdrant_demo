ROTH: You have to be careful what you say in front of the others... they frighten easy. It's always been that way, most men frighten easy.
MICHAEL: We're making a big investment in Cuba. That's my only concern.
ROTH: My concern is that the three million never arrived at Batista's numbered account in Switzerland. He thinks it's because you have second thoughts about his ability to stop the rebels.
MICHAEL: The money was sent.
ROTH: Then you have to trace it. Michael, people here look at me as a reliable man. I can't afford not to be looked on as a reliable man. But you know all that; there's nothing you can learn from me. You shouldn't have to put up with a sick old man as a partner.
MICHAEL: I wouldn't consider anyone else.
ROTH: Except the President of the United States.
ROTH: If only I could live to see it, kid; to be there with you. How beautifully we've done it, step by step. Here, protected, free to make our profits without the Justice Department, the FBI; ninety miles away in partnership with a friendly government. Ninety miles, just a small step, looking for a man who desperately wants to be President of the United States, and having the cash to make it possible.
MICHAEL: You'll be there to see it; you'll be there.
