Company is being bought. Questions to ask future employer?
Just got news from my boss that a representative from the company that is buying us is coming into the office tomorrow. We haven't been told yet how pay/jobs will change with the new takeover, but I do know that they will be reinterviewing every current employee to decide if we will be kept on. I don't know what to expect for tomorrow. No one really does. But I would like to have some questions ready just in case I have the opportunity to ask.
