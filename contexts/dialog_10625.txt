CARTER: What happened to you, then?
KEITH: How'd you find me?
CARTER: Did they give you a rough time?
KEITH: No. You bastard. You knew they'd come back.
CARTER: No, I didn't, Does Albert Swift still live over the ferry?
KEITH: Get knotted.
CARTER: All right. All right. I want to square things with you first.
KEITH: Oh yes? How?
KEITH: Stuff it! My girl friend's coming from Liverpool tonight. Nice surprise, isn't it?
CARTER: I'm sorry. Here. This'll pay for a course in karate.
