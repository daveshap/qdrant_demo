Why would modern OS allocate static addresses or why is ASLR still needed? I have a question about ASLR which allocates randomized addresses for things. Based on my understanding (which might be wrong), a modern OS has pretty complicated memory management mechanisms and it seems REALLY challenging to allocate the same address for the same program every single time. In other words, by intuition, I feel like randomized address should be the default behavior, and to allocate static address would require some effort. Is this understanding completely wrong? Or the OS allocates separate address space for each process so that in each address space the process always gets its comfortable static address by default?
