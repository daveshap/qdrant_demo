wireless point-to-point security I have a remote site where I need to bridge approx 700m distance either with fibre or wireless for a backbone internet connection.The digging would cost a bit more and many suppliers are offering point-to-point wireless technology.I have seen Ubiquity, Silku and Cisco Meraki and I am sure there are many others which I am not aware of.Price is one factor which I would only look at if you can compare apples to apples.My question is about the security of Point-to-Point wireless. Could you help me gather some security criteria to help to decide what technology would suit the best for this scenario?I am trying to not be biased towards any brands but instead focusing on the security elements.
