CAMERAMAN BILL: Hey Ed, shouldn't we do another take? Big Baldy kinda got stuck in the doorway.
ED: No, it's fine. It's real! In actuality, Lobo would struggle with that problem every day.
ED: Wow, this lab looks great. Except why is there a stove and refrigerator?
PAUL MARCO: We couldn't afford any more props. If it seems weird, maybe you can add a scene where they eat dinner.
ED: Nah, it'll work. Where's Bela?
ED: Bela, are you ready?
BELA: Mmph? Where am I?
ED: You're shooting Bride Of The Atom." Scene 85."
ED: You'll be sitting on the right.
BELA: I'm not getting near that goddamn thing. One of those burned me on The Return Of Chandu.""
ED: Okay. Then you'll be sitting on the <u>left</u>.
ED: Here's the scene. Loretta, you're in a trance. You glide in and get on the operating table. Now Tor, you're supposed to tie her down. But you have an angora fetish... and when you rub that swatch of angora, it makes you refuse so Bela has to discipline you.
TOR: Okey-dokey.
