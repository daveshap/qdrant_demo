They think I am an Architect, what should I do?
Hi guys I've worked for this small architecture and engineering firm for about two years. When I sent my resume for a drafter position I was very clear I had completed x credits in the architecture program in my home country, never said I had graduated. However, all my coworkers think I am an architect. I am doing very good here, I started with a low salary but now I make more money than all of them that are actual architects. I didn't do anything wrong, I never lied about it, they got it wrong for some reason. However, I did have the opportunity to correct them last time a new employee was being introduced to us and they said "everyone in this row are architects", but I didn't say anything. What should I do?

ps: by "architect" I mean bachelor in Architecture, not a licensed Architect.

**UPDATE**: Probably I wasn't clear enough or I shouldn't have used the term "architect". Here in the office, we all know that there is only one person who is the licensed architect. He is the one signing and stamping all architectural projects.

However, it's a common practice when introducing someone to call them "architect" or "engineer" even though they are not licensed. When referring to the licensed professional, we say "he is the licensed architect". I know this is technically wrong, but this is not the point here.

The point is that they think I am a bachelor in Architecture but I am not and now after two years I feel very uncomfortable having to explain them I didn't finish architectural school.
