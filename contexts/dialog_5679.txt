BRENT: Ok.
JODY: Daddy, are you upset that I'm still a virgin?!
BRENT: No honey.
JODY: You are upset.
BRENT: I'm not.
JODY: I thought you'd be pleased.
BRENT: I am. I'm so very proud of you. Go back to sleep.
MARGE: Well?
BRENT: She's still a virgin.
MARGE: Did you warn her?
BRENT: No. Let her get at least one more peacefully night's sleep.
BRENT: If I'd gone public with this yesterday Annette Michaels might be alive today.
TOM: Oh GOD Brent, is there anything you don't feel guilty about?
BRENT: is there anything you do?
TOM: Focus on the present. You always want to change the past. Let's figure out what you are going to tell the parents today, not what you should told them yesterday.
BRENT: I'm going to tell them everything I know. I'm calling a town meeting for eight p.m.
TOM: You tell these people someone is out there killing virgins and we're going to have a goddamn fuckfest on our hands.
BRENT: Better than a pile of dead teenagers.
