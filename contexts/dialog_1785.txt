BALA: He was a worker. I danced with him at a <u>worker's bar</u> just the other day. I'm not shocking you, am I?
Z: No...as a matter of fact...
BALA: OH MY GOD, IT'S YOU! YOU'RE A WORKER!!! A filthy, stupid, disgusting WORKER!
Z: Gee, uh, could you say it a little louder, I think there are some ants in the next colony who didn't hear you.
BALA: I CAN'T DANCE WITH A WORKER!
Z: That's not what you said the <u>other</u> <u>night</u> --
BALA: Quiet -- sshhh!!
Z: -- At the <u>worker bar</u>! You were pretty hot to trot then!
BALA: SSHH!!! SSHH!!!
FORMICA: What's this? A <u>worker</u> has been masquerading as a war hero?!
Z: Well it wasn't a masquerade, really, it was more what I'd call a clever ruse --
FORMICA: ARREST HIM!
Z: Can't we all settle this like adults -- we're not larvae anymore --
