I’m very grateful for my cat
It’s 2:00am and I just woke up in a panic. This happens at least 3 times a week. My heart is racing and I’m breathing fast and I can tell that a tunnel of anxiety is about to consume me. Initially I don’t know why- probably a nightmare but I can’t remember what I was dreaming about. Then I start thinking about everything I have to do today and all the time I wasted yesterday laying around the house when I should have been getting things done. My heart is still pounding in my chest and I feel nauseas but at least my breathing has slowed.

Then, also as usual, my cat jumps on my chest, lays down and purrs softly. Focusing on petting her slowly and listening to her purr drives the anxious thoughts from my mind and gives me something else to focus on. She usually sleeps on the end of my bed but always stays on my chest until I fall asleep again.

I don’t know what I would do without her. She does this when I’m awake and anxious as well but it really helps me fall back asleep at night.

This will probably get buried but I just wanted to share.
