JACK: What-are you? A fucking moron? It's three o'clock in the morning, Frank. Who's watching? Your wife? Maybe you can get us a gig playing Little Frank's birthday party. What do you think?
FRANK: Look. I didn't know when we were going to be on until yesterday. What was I supposed to do? I had the pianos anyway.
JACK: Basketballs, Frank. You had us playing for basketballs.
FRANK: I'm sorry. I should've checked it out. I screwed up. But that doesn't mean you walk out in the middle of a gig.
JACK: What?
FRANK: It wasn't professional, Jack. It was a stunt. A stupid-ass stunt.
JACK: What's happening to you, Frank? You been kissing ass so long you're starting to like it? You let that guy turn us into clowns tonight. We were always small time, but we were never clowns, Frank. What's happened to your dignity?
FRANK: Dignity? Who the hell are you to talk about dignity?
