Goodbye, r/Suicidewatch.
Not long ago I posted here. This throwaway then went dormant. After struggling a few months after I had posted, I had a breakdown in front of a friend. He talked to me for three hours and helped me as much as somebody who isn't me could help. I continued to fight my own personal battle.

I won. I fucking won. I learned to not hate people anymore (Go ahead and read the other posts if you please). I learned to enjoy life again. I'm smiling as I write this post. I've started helping people as much as I could, and being my gamer self I've sent steam gifts to people who can't afford their own hobby (better gaming than drugs or something, right?). Hopefully this is the last time I'll ever post here. It's kinda funny looking back and seeing myself one month ago. I'm a totally new person.

So... Goodbye.
