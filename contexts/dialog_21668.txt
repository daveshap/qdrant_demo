COULMIER: Perhaps -- in time -- you'll earn them back through good behavior --
THE MARQUIS: You can't --! You mustn't --! I've all the demons of hell in my head; my only salvation is to vent them on paper --
COULMIER: Try reading, for a change. The writer who produces more than he reads? The sure mark of an amateur.
COULMIER: Start with the Bible; it's cheerier, and more artfully written.
THE MARQUIS: That monstrous God of yours? He strung up his very own son like a side of veal; I shudder to think what He'd do to me.
COULMIER: You know what sacrilege is, don't you? The last refuge of the failed provocateur.
THE MARQUIS: I'll die of loneliness! I've no company but the characters I create --
COULMIER: Whores and pederasts? You're better off without them.
THE MARQUIS: I have a proposition.
COULMIER: You always do.
THE MARQUIS: Madeleine. She's besotted with me; she'd do anything I ask. She could pay you a midnight visit --
COULMIER: I don't know who you insult more; her or me.
THE MARQUIS: Part the gates of heaven
COULMIER: That's enough.
THE MARQUIS: You're tense, darling. You could use a long, slow screw.
COULMIER: Good day, Marquis.
THE MARQUIS: THEN BUGGER ME!
