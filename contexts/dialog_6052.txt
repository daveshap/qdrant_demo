LELAND: Do we stand for the same things that the Chronicle" stands for
BERNSTEIN: Certainly not. So what's that got to do with it? Mr. Kane, he'll have them changed to his kind of newspapermen in a week.
LELAND: Probably. There's always a chance, of course, that they'll change Mr. Kane - without his knowing it.
KANE: Well, gentlemen, are we going to war?
LELAND: Our readers are, anyway, I don't know about the rest of the country.
KANE: It'll be our first foreign war in fifty years, Brad. We'll cover it the way the Hickville Gazette" covers the church social! The names of everybody there; what they wore; what they ate; who won the prizes; who gave the prizes - I tell you
LELAND: But there is no Front, Charlie. There's a very doubtful civil war. Besides, I don't want the job.
KANE: All right, Brad, all right - you don't have to be a war correspondent unless you want to - I'd want to. Hello, Georgie.
