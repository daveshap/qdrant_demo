An adverb to mean that something looks to be in a certain way but may or may not be so? <blockquote>  This country's ranking is ----- promising, but there are doubts  whether they should be taken at face value.</blockquote>I am not sure about whether such adverbs as \"apparently\" or \"ostensibly\" are good here. Are they? Which one is the most idiomatic one?
