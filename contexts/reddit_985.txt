whoever you are, I love you.
the panic will subside, I promise you. take in deep breaths and remember that you are loved and appreciated. above all, you are strong, and a short-lived bout of anxiety won’t and can’t kill you, you beautiful, beautiful human being.
idk you but I’m here for you.
again, I love you. take care.
