I’m tired and scared
Today, after years of psychological abuse, my father finally got physically violent as well. 
He threw a vase at me and hit me in the head, then pushed my mother to the floor, all while shouting like a madman.
He was completely out of control, I saw pure violence in his eyes. 
After two hours of him screaming and threatening, I told my mother to leave him, she’s been suffering for 25 years. 
I know perfectly well she’s not going to end their marriage. 
Two years ago, for the same reasons, I went through the most terrible times of my life. 
I’d put out cigarettes on my harms, cut myself, was thinking about suicide 24/7.
I would sit every night on the balcony with my legs hanging from the railings, hoping to find the strength to give myself a little push. 
Today I felt it all coming back to me. 
I know I couldn’t deal with all that again.
I want to die. If I killed myself, my mom would get away from him and be free from all the hurt she’s been put through. She deserves better, I don’t.
I’m his son, fifty percent of my being stems from him. That alone makes me nauseous.
I can’t. I just can’t.
We’ll be forced to live in the same house for months, we’re in quarantine. I’d rather end it now
