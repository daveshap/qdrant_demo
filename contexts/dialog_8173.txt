REYNOLDS: I know thy works and thy labour and how thou canst not bear them that are evil. And thou hast tried them who say they are apostles and hast found them to be liars". Revelations II."

REYNOLDS: It means who's side are you on?
HAMERSLEY: You didn't ask me to meet you 30 miles from my office for a Bible study class.

HAMERSLEY: Fuck you.
REYNOLDS: What?
HAMERSLEY: I said fuck you.
REYNOLDS: Is that anyway to talk to an old school chum?
HAMERSLEY: You're gonna finger me as soft on terrorism? <i>Terrorism,</i> you unconscionable asshole?
REYNOLDS: There are planes falling out of the sky, buildings blowing up. <i>American</i> buildings. <i>Americans</i> getting bombs in the mail. What are we gonna do!?
HAMERSLEY: We're not gonna hand you and your band of lunatics the keys to the kingdom. I'm not gonna sit in Congress and write a law that allows the NSA to point a camera and a microphone at anything they damn well feel like. And the next time you have something to say to me, we do it above-board, in my office, like everyone else. Now get outa my car, I've got a committee meeting on the hill.
