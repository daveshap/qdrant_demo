SONNY: He was talkin' about arrangements ... we were talkin' about the TV.
SAL: Why couldn't he talk about that here?
SONNY: He was showin' me how the airport bus is comin' in, like that, Sal. What's wrong with him?
SONNY: Hey, you okay?
SYLVIA: He's got diabetes. He's not a well person.
SONNY: Those bastards -- they poisoned the pizza! Sal - you didn't eat any pizza!?
MULVANEY: I didn't eat any pizza.
SYLVIA: I told you, he's got diabetes.
