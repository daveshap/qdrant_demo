Should I reconsider going to grad school full time in lieu of COVID-19?
Hi everyone, I am currently working a full time job at a large tech company, but I am not fulfilled with the work and made the decision over a year ago to go into I/O Psychology. I've been admitted into a 2 year full time M.S. in I/O Psych program (expected graduation: May 2022) to my top choice, and I'm scheduled to enroll in the fall. I will most likely have to quit my job (they probably wont support part time work) and find a part-time research assistant job while at school. I'm also really excited - I'm passionate about the field, excited to learn, and excited to eventually get into a role I'll really enjoy.

However, I'm being advised to reconsider this due to COVID-19, and how it might put us into a recession similar to '08. I'm leaning towards going through with my M.S. because:

* I'm passionate about the field and want to work in it long term
* I will continue working a job that I'm not fulfilled with if I don't go through with my M.S.

Am I shooting myself in the foot by doing this? Do you think it will be extremely hard to find a job after graduation? I'd like to get all of your thoughts on some precautions to take during making this decision as well as any advice/insights. Thanks a lot!
