ANTHONY: I can't believe he just jumped you.
DIGNAN: Can you hand me those french fries.
ANTHONY: I wish I'd been there.
DIGNAN: Would of been nice.
ANTHONY: Man. I'm sorry. We just went for a walk --
DIGNAN: I don't really feel like talking about it. The only thing I feel like is getting the fuck out of this place.
ANTHONY: We need a car.
DIGNAN: I have an idea for that.
ANTHONY: What?
DIGNAN: Inez has a master key to all these rooms, doesn't she? Doesn't she?
ANTHONY: I don't think we can do that.
DIGNAN: I know we can. It's real simple. We go into a room, grab some car keys and --
ANTHONY: What I'm saying is she wouldn't go for that.
DIGNAN: She doesn't need to know.
ANTHONY: I don't know, Dignan. I just --
DIGNAN: Look. I'm ready to get the fuck out of here. It's real torture for me to be here. Getting the shit kicked out of me by Mexicans.
ANTHONY: Shh.
DIGNAN: No one to back me up. Now I have a good idea. So unless you come up with something better --
ANTHONY: Dignan. I can't do that. All right? I just can't.
