CHARLIE: Looking good out there.
PEGGY: Thanks.
CHARLIE: I noticed you were giving me the silent treatment at lunch. I guess I deserved it. I've been thinking about my three year plan and I think it's unworkable. I must have been delirious.
PEGGY: I thought it had a lot of merit.
CHARLIE: In the abstract maybe. Get a grip on yourself! But when I imagine you going out with other guys, I feel... ah...
PEGGY: Rejected, worthless, miserable.
CHARLIE: Yeah. Like that.
PEGGY: Good.
PEGGY: What a great kite.
RICHARD: I'm writing a book on kite construction. What did you want to talk about?
PEGGY: I want to ask you a question. Do you think...time travel is possible?
RICHARD: Are you doing some kind of science project?
PEGGY: Sort of.
RICHARD: Well... in a Newtonian framework, the possibilities were limited, but with the advent of relativity theory, the idea of absolute time can no longer be reasonably affirmed.
RICHARD: And then, there's Richard's Burrito.
PEGGY: What's that?
RICHARD: That's my own theory based on a Mexican food called the burrito. I had it once when my parents took me to Disneyland.
PEGGY: I	know what a burrito is.
RICHARD: Well, I think time is like a burrito. Sometimes it just folds over on itself and one part touches the other.
PEGGY: What's inside?
RICHARD: You can till it with whatever you want. From illusions to memory, from experience to innocence, from happiness to the entire universes
PEGGY: So you think time travel is possible? For people?
RICHARD: Absolutely. People, dogs, elephants.
PEGGY: Listen, you've gotta keep this a secret. You can't tell a soul. Promise?
RICHARD: Okay. I promise.
PEGGY: This is serious. Nobody can know. Ah, I've returned from the future. I traveled back here 25 years.
RICHARD: You probably are crazy. Wait a minute. Is this some kind of joke? I know what you all, think of me.
