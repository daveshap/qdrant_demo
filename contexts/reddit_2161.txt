Why do Movie acceptances seem so easy?
How did Gabriella from High School Musical get into Stanford? How did Aaron Samuels from Mean Girls end up at Northwestern? How did Sam from A Cinderella Story end up at Princeton? How did her boyfriend end up at Princeton? 

I mean, all they did care about was who was Homecoming Queen, or how important their love life is, or how they absolutely love brownies with pot???
