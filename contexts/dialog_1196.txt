MOZART: Wait! Ask him if he'd give me some money now. Tell him if he would, that would help me finish it.
SALIERI: Finish what?
MOZART: He knows. He knows!
SCHIKANEDER: Herr Salieri.
SALIERI: Yes, I am looking after him.
SCHIKANEDER: Can we come in?
SALIERI: Well, he's sleeping now. Better not.
SCHIKANEDER: But he's all right?
SALIERI: Oh, yes. He's just exhausted. He became dizzy, that's all. We should let him rest.
SCHIKANEDER: Well, tell him we were here, won't you?
SALIERI: Of course.
SCHIKANEDER: And say everything went wonderfully. A triumph-de-luxe - say that! Tell him the audience shouted his name a hundred times.
SALIERI: Bene.
SCHIKANEDER: I'll call tomorrow.
SALIERI: Yes. And congratulations to all of you. It was superb.
