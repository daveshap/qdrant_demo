What are some niche careers that while not that widely known, you think people should be aware of?
Pretty straight forward. I have heard a few people tell me that the career they are working in now isn't one they had ever even considered when they were younger. Got me to thinking that there are probably loads of career opportunities that people don't even know are out there.
