Q: Am I required to vote for every item on the ballot.     
A: No. Your ballot is still valid if you leave some contests without a vote.

Q: What if I go to the polls and they tell me I am not registered to vote?     
A: Per [this site:](https://www.rockthevote.org/voting-information/voting-faqs/) First, make sure you are at the right polling place. If you are at the wrong polling place they will not have your name on the list of voters. If you are at the correct location and are not on the list, you can still cast a ballot. Ask the poll worker for a *provisional* ballot. After the polls close on Election Day the state will check on the status of your voter registration and if there was a mistake made. The state must notify you as to whether your ballot was counted.
