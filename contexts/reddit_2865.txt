How do I break out of solely Administrative Assistant positions?
I (31 m) graduated just under a year ago with my BA in Social Welfare. I have been more drawn to training and development roles since graduating, supporting diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives along the way. 

The problem is, the only positions I'm finding are entry level admin work. I've been working in Administrative roles for nearly 6 years now so I don't feel especially challenged, but keep getting blocked from other opportunities. I run projects for other departments consistently, and stay on top of my own tasks while training new hires, and I've only been in my current position for a few months.

The company I'm working for now is not one that I plan to stay at long term because of its toxic upper management. Right now I'm just working on building my resume and getting experience with a few other projects, but it's running me ragged with everything I'm responsible for. Not to mention what a bummer it is to not feel appreciated by the organization. Thinking about getting my HR certificate just so I have another piece of paper to back up my abilities.

I appreciate any advice or insight on how I could get out of this position and make myself more marketable.
