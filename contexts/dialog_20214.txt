FAITH: You expecting somebody you know?
KATE: Well, you don't have to get snippy with me.
FAITH: Sorry.
KATE: So, what exactly is Larry's side of the story, anyway?
FAITH: I don't know, Kate. I just said that. I'm sorry. I'm just on edge. I'm afraid we're losing him.
KATE: You think he misses me at all?
FAITH: 'Course he does.
KATE: You know, when Larry and I got married, I thought we were so lucky we found each other so early. People talk about spending their lives together, how many of them really get to? But maybe I was wrong. Maybe sooner or later everything wears out.
