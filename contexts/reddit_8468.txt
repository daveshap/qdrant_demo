How would a wealth tax in the United States be structured, compared to those previously implemented across European countries?
Democratic presidential candidates [Elizabeth Warren](https://elizabethwarren.com/plans/ultra-millionaire-tax) and [Bernie Sanders](https://berniesanders.com/issues/tax-extreme-wealth/) have in recent months advocated for a wealth tax on the very rich, promoting it as a progressive tax that can in turn help fund additional progressive policy measures. However, the viability of such a wealth tax has been questioned.^^[\[1\]](https://www.politifact.com/article/2019/apr/25/elizabeth-warren-does-her-wealth-tax-pay-her-child/) ^^[\[2\]](https://taxfoundation.org/elizabeth-warren-wealth-tax-oecd/) ^^[\[3\]](https://www.factcheck.org/2019/06/facts-on-warrens-wealth-tax-plan/) Critics draw evidence from the flaws realized in such taxes implemented in various European countries, noting concerns about tax evasion, difficulty of wealth evaluation and enforcement, and capital flight and decreased foreign investment. While up to 14 European countries have previously implemented a wealth tax, [only Switzerland, Spain, and Norway still have one in place](https://www.cesifo-group.de/DocDL/dice-report-2018-2-drometer-frank-hofbauer-p%C3%A9rez-rhode-schworm-stitteneder.pdf), although Belgium, the Netherlands, and Italy have some form of limited wealth taxation.

If a wealth tax similar to the ones proposed by Senators Warren and Sanders were to be introduced in the United States, what measures would need to be taken to avoid the problems present in current and past wealth taxes in Europe? Proponents of a wealth tax, such as [Professors Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman, argue](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2019/09/05/estimating-the-economic-impact-of-a-wealth-tax/) that the much higher exemption thresholds in Warren's and Sanders' proposals would largely avoid targeting households with high net worth but low liquid assets, and the existence of the [Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_Account_Tax_Compliance_Act) makes tax avoidance easier to combat. The OECD also recommends strictly limiting exemptions for assets, which is part of Warren's plan.^^[3] Do these factors adequately address concerns?
