DAD: What do you mean -- gone? What the hell kind of a nurse are you, anyway?
LINDA: I'm sorry, Mr. Gardner. I was out of my office for a minute and when I got back -- he was gone.
DAD: What did he talk to you about?
LINDA: He was upset with moving, I believe.
DAD: Is that all he said?
LINDA: Why, yes. Why?
