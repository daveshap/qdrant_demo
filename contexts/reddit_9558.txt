Baby Care in a Shortage
Alternatives to diapers:  Yes, you can order cloth diapers from amazon but those get expensive quick. Flour sack towels work as diapers in a pinch. You will need to fold them into a “Kite Fold” but it’s pretty simple and there are instruction videos on YouTube. You’ll need about two dozen for a newborn-6 month old baby and only a dozen for a baby older than that. You can double them for more absorbency and pin them with baby pins. You’ll need to change more frequently if you don’t have an outer diaper cover. You can wash them by emptying the waste into a trash can and then cleaning with dawn dish soap or tide. Expensive diaper laundry soap is a comic and honestly doesn’t clean as good. Soak in bleach and wash about once a month and line dry outside to get any lingering ammonia smell out. Pin with diaper pins. Best of all they are cheap! A dozen flour sack towels is about $6.00 and diaper pins are $1-2 for a pack.

Alternative to baby wipes: This one is easy. Baby wipes and a cleaning solution of three parts water to one part baby soap.

Alternative to baby wash: use ten parts water to one part vegetable glycerin and one part coconut or virgin olive oil. Add essential oil if you want fragrance but look up which are safe. I stick to just a drop or two of lavender oil.

Alternative to formula: Unfortunately this one isn’t safe. Please don’t try to make your own formula.

Stay safe out there everyone!
