Do you ever feel like your anxiety isn't bad enough to be valid?
I'm currently seeing a therapist, who did diagnose me with generalized anxiety (and I struggle a lot particularly with *social* anxiety, as well). However, I constantly feel that my anxiety isn't "enough". I don't mean that anxiety is a good thing that we should aspire to have as much of as possible--not at all. It's just that my symptoms and the things that cause me to be anxious coupled with the fact that my anxiety doesn't seem to be as severe as other people's causes me to feel unworthy and unheard. I've never had a panic attack before, and I know several people who with anxiety who have definitely had panic attacks and such. Mine has never gotten to that point. I kind of feel like I'm lost--I'm too anxious to function normally, but seemingly not anxious enough to feel like my anxiety is taken seriously by others. It kind of feels like if people don't see your anxiety physically, if you don't wear it on your sleeve, then you must not be struggling. Has anyone ever felt this way about their anxiety? I feel invalid, like I don't belong sometimes.
