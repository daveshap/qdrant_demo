JOE: Well, this thought just struck me. It wasn't too long ago I was washing dishes way the hell somewhere in Texas.
RATSO: Yeah, well, so?
JOE: Now I'm here. I'm in New York City. Getting picked for things. Don't you see what I'm driving at?
RATSO: What you're driving at, you want me to get lost so you can go to your fancy-ass party.
JOE: Did I say that? Did I? It don't say nothing about you...
RATSO: Don't say nothing about you either.
JOE: But they picked me, right? So what I'll do, I'll just say, now look, you want me? Well, I don't go nowhere without my buddy here.
RATSO: Well, what the hell, I got nothing better to do.
