Copy SQL Server replication configuration from production to test environment Where I'm currently working we have an SQL Server's instance for a billing database and another instance for customer database. Both databases keep some tables synchronized using replication mechanism. I'm trying to set up some automated way to get fresh backups from production into QA/DEV environments, but in order for our platform to be kind of a mirror of production environment we need this replication thing between customer and billing databases to work. I know very few about these kind of things, I'm only a developer by unfortunately no one else is willing to do it.My question is, Is it possible to copy the replication setup in production to QA without having to go along all the process of setting up replication step by step in QA/DEV environments? Maybe generating some scripts of this setup from production and with some small changes enable it in QA/DEV environments?Additional notes:We use an instance for QA/Dev customer databases.Another instance for QA/DEV billing databases.Both instances run in the same server.SQL Server version:<blockquote>  Microsoft SQL Server 2016 (RTM-GDR) (KB3210111) - 13.0.1728.2 (X64)       Dec 13 2016 04:40:28       Copyright (c) Microsoft Corporation      Enterprise Edition (64-bit) on Windows Server 2012 R2 Standard 6.3  (Build 9600: ) (Hypervisor)</blockquote>This is probably a dumb question, but I'd appreciate any help about it.Thanks.
