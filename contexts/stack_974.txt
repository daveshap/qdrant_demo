Which Ubuntu distro is right for this 2-in-1? I own a Dell Latitude 11 inch 2-in-1 ... it has a m5-6Y57 processor, 8GB of RAM and 256GB SSD..Which Ubuntu distro is right for this 2-in-1 ? I want to read ebooks on it so the distro has to support screen rotation and gestures...I also want to take notes with it...The 2-in-1 is Wacom AES enabled and has an active pen.I guess Ubuntu gnome is the right choice for this laptop...but will it run smooth on this 2-in-1 ? what other distros should i look at ?I also have a Dell inspiron 3179, which has m3-7Y30 processor, 4GB of RAM and 250GB SATA3 SSD ... Which Ubuntu distro is right for this one ? I am looking at elementary OS and Xubuntu at the moment...Do Xfce and Pantheon support screen rotation and gestures ? i intend to read ebooks on this too...but no note taking as the touchscreen is not AES and doesn't support an active pen.What other distros do you recommend ?I know there is Ubuntu Mate and LXQT/DE....but these don't have touchscreen functionalities...
