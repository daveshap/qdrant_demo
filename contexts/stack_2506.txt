Count Polygons in Buffer using ArcMap? I'm using ArcMap and work with a dataset that contains all the buildings of north rhine-westphalia. This dataset contains different attributes for every object.My task is to count all neighboring buildings of a building. For that I create a buffer (100m) for every building and want count every other building within this buffer. How do I do that?Additionally, how do I get the mean height of all buildings in this buffer?
