WOODWARD: What do you think Mrs. Graham wants to see me for?
SIMONS: Maybe to fire you--since you two started on this story, the Post stock has dropped, what, 50 percent? And the word is some Nixon people are challenging her TV licenses. I'm not saying she's going on relief, but I don't think it's unreasonable for her to want to meet you.
WOODWARD: You think she wants us to ease up on the story?
SIMONS: I don't know, but I don't think that's unreasonable either, do you?
MRS. GRAHAM: I'm so glad you could come, Mr.--
WOODWARD: --I'm Woodward.
MRS. GRAHAM: You know, the paper was my father's and my husband's when they were alive and I was thinking back a year or two ago when Ben called me and said he wanted to publish the Pentagon Papers the next day. The Times had already been stopped from publishing anymore of them and all my legal counsel said don't
WOODWARD: I think so.
MRS. GRAHAM: Are you sure?
WOODWARD: No.
MRS. GRAHAM: When will you be, do you think?-- when are we going to know it all?
WOODWARD: It may never come out.
MRS. GRAHAM: Never? Please don't tell me never. Ben says you've found some wonderful sources.
WOODWARD: Some Justice Department lawyers and an FBI man, and some people from the Committee to Re-Elect, yes ma'am.
MRS. GRAHAM: And the underground garage one. Would I know him?
WOODWARD: I couldn't say.
MRS. GRAHAM: But it's possible.
WOODWARD: It is.
MRS. GRAHAM: You've never told anyone who he is? But you'd have to tell me if I asked you. Tell me.
WOODWARD: I would, if you really ever wanted to know.
MRS. GRAHAM: I really want to know.
