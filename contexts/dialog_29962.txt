JOHN: Nothing. There's no safe under here.
GRACE: There has to be!
JOHN: There isn't! There's nothing under here but more floor. Jesus fucking Christ! We killed a man for nothing but floor.
GRACE: It's got to be here. I heard him talk about it. He bragged about it. Six steps out, three left.
JOHN: This is good. This is real good. This is so good they might not even charge us with murder when they catch us. They'll probably just lock us up for being idiots.
GRACE: If it isn't here, why would he wear that stupid key?
JOHN: You're calling Jake stupid? You!?
GRACE: Don't yell at me! I know it's here! I know it!
