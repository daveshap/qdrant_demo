I reached out for help and no one listened.
Today I was on the sofa and i felt a crushing boot on my chest. I have been in a rut these past two weeks, the same kind i fall into from time to time where i simply shut down, and I reached out to my friend and he didn't want to listen. He was happy today and he felt like i was dampening his good mood as i began to talk. I couldn't bear it so i fell quiet and lied down. I listen and listen daily, to everyone and everything, i give advice and support, but today i was hurting and wished to share and he didn't want to listen. No one does so I'm usually okay with it. I like listening and being the receiver. But today was different. Today i woke up with no wishes to step forward. 

I'm okay not sharing since my other friend is usually always busy and has her own close friends. My mom doesn't understand it so i can't tell her. My psychologist is absent due to an illness. Today the boot crushed me till i cried, and i don't cry at all.

I've fallen into the same rut i fall into after a good batch of "productive weeks." Where i fuck off and ruin my progress. No workout, eating too much, staying up late, watching garbage, no writing my book, no work done on my videos, procrastinating, numb, alone. Feeling worthless. Wishing for company. Having none. Where my self esteem dwindles every second as i type this at midnight when i should be sleeping. But nobody's listening, so its okay.
