How to create virtual machine for Virtualbox from extern drive? I want to create a virtual machine of a windows 7 pro system which runs on my notebook before.It's connected by USB.About 40GB and the whole drive has 500GB.It's an OEM version: It doesn't run when booting by USB (only when it's intern installed) but I read about virtual machines being OEM will work?How do I create the virtual machine?Thank you!
