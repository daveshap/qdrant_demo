LILY: What the hell's his problem?
JAKE: Don't worry about it.
LILY: It's just that I left my asshole decoder ring at home, so how do I know not to worry?
JAKE: You need to get a haircut.
LILY: What?
JAKE: And some new clothes.
LILY: Why?
JAKE: We're going to rope this banker tomorrow and you gotta at least look classy, if not be classy. You gotta do this thing and I don't even know if you can.
LILY: You're just going to have to trust me.
JAKE: I don't trust anyone.
LILY: Then show me how.
