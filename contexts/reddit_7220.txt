Starting a seasonal job as an “Elf/Santa’s Helper” and starting the second day they want me to work alone!?!
I went to “training” yesterday and it most certainly was not training. They didn’t have me do anything. It’s only four of us working this season and I’m the only one who hasn’t done this so everyone was in a rush to go home since we had to meet up late. They showed me around the program but that’s about it. Not how to get kids to Santa or what to say to people, how to take/print photos or anything!! My first day I work four hours and by the next day she wants me working by myself and doing end of day and even taking the money to the bank!! Yes “Santa” will be there with me but he can’t help me because he has to keep his act together while in public.. I’m so scared about working by myself when I literally know nothing! It’s only until Christmas Eve, but I have anxiety through the roof when it comes to this stuff!! I’ve been out of a job for a little while so having to interact with people by myself is nerve wracking...... Any tips or advice?
