TOM: Well, that'll happen.
WOMAN: Where did you learn all this stuff?
TOM: What stuff is that?
WOMAN: About horses? I'd love to learn more about it myself. Do you offer any private lessons for riders?
TOM: Well... Dale... you know, a lot of this stuff... it just... nuts and bolts.
WOMAN: What do you mean?
TOM: Well, if the rider's nuts, the horse bolts. That's the whole lesson right there. You have a good day now... Just... keep on freeing yourself up.
RONA: Oh I clear forget. You had a call from some woman in New York. She sounded pretty wound up.
TOM: I don't any woman in New York. But from what I hear, most of them are wound up.
RONA: The number's by the phone.
RONA: What are you looking at, young man?
TOM: How long were you married?
RONA: Long enough.
TOM: You ever miss it?
RONA: Does a horse miss a saddle?
TOM: Sometimes.
