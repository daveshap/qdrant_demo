Does a density forecast add value beyond a point forecast when the loss function is given? Density forecasts are more universal than point forecasts; they provide information on the whole predicted distribution of a random variable rather than on a concrete function thereof (such as predicted mean, median, quantile, etc.). Availability of a density forecast allows different users pick out relevant elements -- point forecasts -- that are of their interest. Some users will focus on the predicted mean, others on the predicted median, etc., depending on the loss function by which the forecast is evaluated (and which may differ from user to user). Given a density forecast, every user's needs will be satisfied regardless of the loss function, because the density forecast contains all probabilistic information about the random variable.However, if we have a concrete user in mind and know his/her loss function, then Does the density forecast provide any added value over a point forecast tailored to the loss function?If the answer is No in general, what are the conditions to make it a Yes?P.S. @hejseb draws an interesting parallel between a point forecast tailored to the loss function and a sufficient statistic; perhaps this can inspire an answer.
