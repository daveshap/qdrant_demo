I start a new job tomorrow. Wish me luck üòÅ
I don't have a lot of people to celebrate this milestone with, but I knew y'all would understand the significance. I'm anxious af, but also excited. I think this is going to be good.

UPDATE: it went really really well! Thanks everyone for your support ‚ù§Ô∏è I appreciated all of your comments. They helped me stay calm.
