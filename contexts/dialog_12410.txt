KIRSTY: Big house.
LARRY: You like?
KIRSTY: Me like.
LARRY: I'll show you around when we've got this damn bed moved.
KIRSTY: Is Julia here?
LARRY: Upstairs. Treat her gently, huh? She hates moving.
KIRSTY: Surprise.
LARRY: Kirsty.
KIRSTY: O.K. I'll be nice. You get on with the muscle work. I'll make myself some coffee.
LARRY: Kitchen's through on your left.
2ND MAN: That your daughter?
LARRY: Uh-huh.
2ND MAN: Got her mother's looks.
LARRY: Her mother's dead.
2ND MAN: Oh.
LARRY: Julia's my second wife.
2ND MAN: Lucky man.
LARRY: Damn right. Now are we going to move the bed or not?
