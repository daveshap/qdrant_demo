Am I the only one living for other people?
Do you ever feel like you're just there because you know you would hurt people if you killed yourself? I just feel like if nobody loved me I could just leave everything but I can't because I know it would change them and they would never be over it. And the thought of being there and only living for other people is awful. I don't wanna live on autopilot for the rest of my life
