Do you think it would be possible to fix what might be a mistake on my BS's transcript?
So I think there may be a mistake on my transcript. In sum, I retook two classes that I got fairly low grades on - one not passing the other barely passing. I got better grades. All this time I thought the I next to my grades meant something else, but it means Included in gpa. So it turns out they included both my old grades and the new grades I got from retaking it are included. I figure it must be a mistake because all the other classes I retook doesn't show that problem.

Thing is, it is a whole year past graduation. ( I had a really terrible advisor - she wasn't even supposed to be one - and to be honest, I had a terrible time in college so when I graduated I tried to put it all behind me for a gap year.) Administration is absolute crap there. It would be over a .03 difference, so I wonder if it's worth it, but I am trying to get into a competitive program with a low gpa I am working on improving, so maybe it is? Or maybe I'm wrong you think? Ughhh I hate the idea of talking to these people again.
