Assistantships?
Hey everyone itâ€™s been a rough summer leading up to my first fall graduate semester at OSU. I was just curious during these times how one lands an assistantship? I would love to do research and get involved, plus get some help financially. Do I reach out to professors? Is there an application? Do I randomly get picked? Thanks!
