PAVEL: What is it you want?
DOUG: First, I want to walk free with a letter, in English, from the Prosecutor General dropping all charges. Second, I want two first class tickets to London leaving tonight and three thousand crowns in a stamped envelope. Lastly, all actions against the students are to be stopped!
PAVEL: I'm not sure it's possible.
DOUG: The choice is yours, it's not negotiable.
