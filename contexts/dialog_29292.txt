QUAID: O.K. then. If I'm not me, then who the hell am I?
LORI: Beats me. I just work here.
LORI: But Doug...There's something I want you to know. You're the best assignment I ever hand. Really.
QUAID: I'm honored.
LORI: You sure you don't wanna...? For old time's sake. If you don't trust me, you can tie me up.
QUAID: I didn't know you were so kinky.
LORI: It's time you found out.
QUAID: Clever girl.
LORI: Doug...You wouldn't shoot me, would you? After all we've been through?
QUAID: Yeah. Some of it was fun.
