Measurement of total AC resistance (including radiation resistance) of a coil using LCR meter If we measure AC resistance of a coil using an LCR meter (or impedance analyser), does it include both ohmic resistance and radiation resistance? I understand that the radiation resistance is negligibly small for coil at low frequencies, however, for example, if we submerge a coil underwater, radiation resistance can be comparable to ohmic resistance. I am measuring resistance of a coil underwater and I noticed a significant increase in resistance compared to the air surrounding. I wanted to confirm that the increase is due to the increase of radiation resistance. Maximum frequency is 1 MHz, and coil self resonance is way above the measurement range - we can safely neglect the effect of parasitic capacitance.
