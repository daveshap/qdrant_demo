How to create a polygon from a Print Composer or Print Layout map extent in QGIS? How do you create a polygon from a QGIS Print Composer or Print Layout map extent (i.e. a polygon that is the exact area shown in a map within a print composer/layout)?Ultimately I would like to do this for an entire atlas so I would like to do this in as automatic a way as possible, but I would even just be content with a rather manual solution too!
