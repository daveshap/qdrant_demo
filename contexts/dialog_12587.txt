ROB: TURN IT OFF, BARRY.
BARRY: IT WON'T GO ANY LOUDER.
BARRY: What are you doing?
ROB: I don't want to hear Public Enemy right now.
BARRY: Public Enemy! All I'm trying to do is cheer us up. Go ahead and put on some old sad bastard music see if I care.
ROB: I don't want old sad bastard music either. I just want something I can ignore.
BARRY: But it's my new tape. My Monday morning tape. I made it last night just for today.
ROB: Yeah, well it's fucking Monday afternoon. You should get out of bed earlier.
BARRY: Don't you want to hear what's next?
ROB: What's next?
BARRY: Play it.
ROB: Say it.
BARRY: Little Latin Lupe Lu.""
DICK: Mitch Ryder and the Detroit Wheels?
BARRY: No. The Righteous Brothers.
DICK: Oh well. Nevermind.
BARRY: What?
DICK: Nothing.
BARRY: No, not nothing. What's wrong with the Righteous Brothers?
DICK: Nothing. I just prefer the other one.
BARRY: Bullshit.
ROB: How can it be bullshit to state a preference?
BARRY: Since when did this shop become a fascist regime?
ROB: Since you brought that bullshit tape in.
BARRY: Great. That's the fun of working in a record store. Playing crappy pap you don't want to listen to. I thought this tape was going to be, you know, a conversation stimulator. I was going to ask you for your top five records to play on a Monday morning and all that, and you just had to ruin it.
ROB: We'll do it next Monday.
BARRY: Well what's the point in that?
ROB: Hey. Didn't you steal that one already?
DICK: Can I help you?
