BUMSTEAD: Why give yourself up?
WHITE: I - ah - couldn't think of anything else to do. I thought maybe you know something... I'm scared.
BUMSTEAD: That was a pretty good escape act at the station. How did you do that?
WHITE: I woke up in a subway. I don't know how I got there.
WHITE: People... after me.
BUMSTEAD: Who?
WHITE: I don't know who they are.
BUMSTEAD: Why are they after you?
WHITE: Don't know that either.
BUMSTEAD: Don't know much, do you?
