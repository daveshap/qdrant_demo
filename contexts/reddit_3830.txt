I just went on my first date ever!
Idk, if this is really the right place for this since, I don't need advice. But, I just went on my first date, it was so much fun (after getting over the nervousness of it all), and I'm just really buzzing. But I don't have anyone to tell, so I figured I'd tell Reddit.
