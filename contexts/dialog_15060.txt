ELLIE: Okay, who's the jerk?
GRANT: Uh, this is our paleobotanist, Dr Ellie.....
ELLIE: Sattler.
ELLIE: Did I say jerk?
HAMMOND: I'm sorry for the dramatic entrance, but I'm in a hurry. Will you have a wee bit of a drink now and then?
ELLIE: I have samples all over the kitchen.
HAMMOND: Come along. I know my way around a kitchen. Come along.
GRANT: And what are those?
ELLIE: Small versions of adults, honey.
HAMMOND: Not just kids - - for everyone. We're going to open next year. Unless the lawyers kill me first. I don't care for lawyers. You?
GRANT: I, uh, don't really know any. We - -

GRANT: What kind of opinions?
HAMMOND: Not to put a fine point on it, your kind. Let's face it, in your particular field, you're the top minds. If I could just get you two to sign off on the park - - you know, give a wee testimonial - - I could get back on schedule - - - -schedule.
ELLIE: Why would they care what we think?
GRANT: What kind of park is it?
HAMMOND: Well, it's - - right up your alley. Look, why don't you both come on down for the weekend. Love to have the opinion of a paleobotoanist as well. I've got a jet standing by at Choteau.
GRANT: No, I'm sorry, that wouldn't be possible. We've just discovered a new skeleton, and - -
HAMMOND: I could compensate you by fully funding your dig
GRANT: - - this would be an awfully unusual time - -
HAMMOND: For a further three years.
