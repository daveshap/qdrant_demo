How do you approach finding a job at the age of 50 with an 11 year unemployment gap?
Seeking advice!

Asking on behalf of another person who doesn’t use reddit. She’s 50 now and has been unemployed for eleven years. Her last job was a bank teller and got laid off in the mass 2008 economic drop. She struggled finding a new job for several years and is now taking care of her mother to make her time more productive. She wants to earn some sort of income but she has such a large gap in her resume that she feels no one would hire her, and especially not at 50. Does anyone have any suggestions of the type of jobs that would potentially take her in? And how should she approach finding a new job? I had no advice to give and thought reddit is a great start (:
