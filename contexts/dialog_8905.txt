FRANK: Jack, you with us?
SUSIE: The Carlton's a dump. No cover. No minimum. And they water their drinks. It's strictly for the Fuller brush crowd.
FRANK: I guess it's,the Plaza then. That brings us to the twenty-seventh. We got the Avedon for three or the Park downtown for two.
SUSIE: We take the Avedon, right? Simple.
SUSIE: The Park? It's only two nights. Why throw away a night?
JACK: Because Blackie Carson books the Park and whenever we've needed a gig he's come through.
SUSIE: Oh. Well, for Blackie then.
FRANK: By the way, I got a messsage yesterday from some guy looking for New Year's action. Resort, upstate.
SUSIE: Hey.
JACK: Sounds like a booking agent looking to book an easy fee.
FRANK: That's what I figure. Probably have us in a bed-and-breakfast playing to the owls.
SUSIE: Maybe it's legit.
FRANK: Maybe. I'll call him.
JACK: Make it collect.
FRANK: That's it except for the first. We got the Sheraton, the Ambassador, or the Holiday Inn on Sixtieth. All three-day turns.
