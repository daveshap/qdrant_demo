FLETCH: I'm still here.
STANWYK: I want it done Thursday evening, around eight PM. My wife will be off to the club for a committee meeting. It's the staff's night off. These will be open.
FLETCH: Wouldn't they normally be locked?
STANWYK: Sometimes yes, sometimes no. The staff usually forgets.
FLETCH: I have the same problem with my help.
STANWYK: I will be here in the room, waiting for you. The safe will be open and there will be fifty thousand dollars in it. You will be wearing rubber gloves. Do you own rubber gloves?
FLETCH: I rent them. Monthly lease, with an option to buy.
STANWYK: In this drawer....
FLETCH: A .357.
STANWYK: Very good. My .357. Use it and no one can trace it to you. The room will be in some disarray.
FLETCH: So it looks like a burglary attempt. You catch me. I get the gun, and shoot you.
STANWYK: Precisely. Are you a good shot?
FLETCH: What's the difference? The noise'll kill you first.
STANWYK: Get me on the first shot, if you can.
FLETCH: I don't think you'll have to worry about that.
STANWYK: Do you have a passport?
FLETCH: Sure, all drifters do.
STANWYK: Fine. After you kill me, take the Jaguar. The keys will be in the glove compartment.
FLETCH: Take it where?
STANWYK: LAX. Go to the Pan Am desk. There will be a ticket waiting for you.
FLETCH: Where am I going?
STANWYK: Rio. Flight 306. Departs at eleven PM.
FLETCH: They serve dinner on the flight?
STANWYK: It'll be a first class-ticket. I'm sure you'll enjoy the ride. I would recommend staying down there at least a year, Mr. Nugent.
FLETCH: You've certainly thought this out, haven't you?
STANWYK: I am not someone who leaves a great deal to chance, Mr. Nugent.
FLETCH: You sure those doors will be open?
STANWYK: Yes. All you provide are the gloves, the passport, and the aim. I'll take care of everything else.
FLETCH: The gun, the money, the tickets, and the dying.
STANWYK: That's right.
FLETCH: You sure got the hard part.
STANWYK: What do you say, Mr. Nugent? You'll be doing me and my family a great service.
STANWYK: Will you kill me?
FLETCH: Sure.
