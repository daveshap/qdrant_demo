DICK: Anyway, you want this guy, he's in L.A. We put him on a flight after he spanked one a my cocktail girls in the Keno room.
CHILI: Leo spanked a waitress?
DICK: Apparently, way it went, he invited her to come to Santa Anita to play the ponies with him. She told him what to do with that and he gave her one on the tush. My guess, he's by his lonesome at the track right now.
DICK: Hey, Chil? Since you're goin' out to L.A. anyway.
CHILI: What've you got?
DICK: Guy owes us a hundred and fifty grand, sixty days over; a movie producer.
CHILI: Movie producer? Yeah, why not.
CHILI: What is this?
ATTENDANT: An Oldsmobile Silhouette.
CHILI: I reserved a Cadillac.
ATTENDANT: Yeah, well, this one's the Cadillac of minivans.
CHILI: You're kidding me, right?
ATTENDANT: Hey, you want La Tierra Rent-A-Car just over there, but I think all they got are Rabbit convertibles.
