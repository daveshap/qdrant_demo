How can I learn a job quicker?
I recently started a new job a couple of months back and I am currently training as a backup for another position for 2 weeks. I have one week left and I just want some advice on how to make the most out of the final week I have in order to not be a total screw up and hopefully get the position whenever one opens up.

So far I've picked up some things but after the two weeks is up I'll fill in whenever someone is on vacation or they need help. This position pays more but it is difficult to get in since there are only 3 spots and most people have been there for 10+ years. TIA for any advice
