I'm introverted and my wife is not.
Lately I'm more-or-less constantly exposed to in-laws who are various levels of taxing, and a friend of my wife's is also staying at our place along with her eight-year-old son this week on vacation from out of town.

I want to lock myself in my bedroom until everyone goes away for at least two days until I remember where solitude intersects with loneliness.

My wife doesn't understand why, and thinks I'm being an asshole for no reason. We're all of us driving to my mother-in-law's for dinner right now (I wasn't consulted during the planning phase of this).

Nobody's starving or on drugs or stealing from me or jeopardizing my career or marriage or setting things on fire or anything, but this bothers me.
