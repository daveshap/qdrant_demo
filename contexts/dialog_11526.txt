TOM: Mad, Ma?
MA: Sometimes they do.
TOM: No, Ma I was at first--but not no more.
MA: Sometimes they do somethin' to you, Tommy. They hurt you--and you get mad--and then you get mean--and they hurt you again--and you get meaner, and meaner--till you ain't no boy or no man any more, but just a walkin' chunk a mean-mad. Did they hurt you like that, Tommy?
TOM: No, Ma. You don't have to worry about that.
MA: Thank God. I--I don't want no mean son
