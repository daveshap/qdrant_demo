BARON: My generosity is not so large as that.
LILI: What do you want with me?
BARON: Your love.
LILI: Your words sting more sharply than your whip.
BARON: I speak of love, and you think only of the lash.
LILI: You are cruel! Your heartless jesting worse than torture! How can you speak of love when you see what I am!
BARON: I like well what I see. It pleases me.
LILI: But I'm hideous!
BARON: You're magnificent.
LILI: Grotesque... monstrous...
BARON: On the contrary! The puling, pallid creature you were before was truly something disgusting. Now you are splendid... a fierce goddess... the embodiment of all that is strong and beautiful.
LILI: You lie! You wish to humiliate me, as if the form I'm forced to bear were not punishment enough!
BARON: You should glory in your animal nature. It is your triumph! None know that better than I!
LILI: God protect me.
BARON: Not from me, surely...
LILI: You... you're a beast!
BARON: We're all of us beasts, my dear. Only most are afraid to show it.
LILI: And you... are you not also afraid?
BARON: I am afraid of nothing.
LILI: Then why hide behind a mask? You are ashamed!
BARON: I know no more of shame than I do of fear. I wear this mask not for concealment but protection.
LILI: Protection?
BARON: I am a creature of darkness. I require the shadow's solace and the black of night... Sunlight is abhorrent to me... I cover myself completely whenever I venture forth in daylight... Sunshine is my destroyer.
LILI: Like some vile toadstool.
BARON: I prefer to think, more like the sagacious owl.
LILI: Do you feed on mice and rats?
BARON: I prefer a plump capon, but will happily serve you rats if they're to your liking.
LILI: Why have you brought me here?
BARON: To be my bride, of course.
LILI: I'd soon die.
