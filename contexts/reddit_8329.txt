Is universal healthcare effective?
DEFINITIONS
Socialized Healthcare: A system where the healthcare* of all citizens is paid for exclusively by the government.
*Likely not including all medical services, as most legislation (such as Canada's https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/health-care-system/canada-health-care-system-medicare/canada-health-act-frequently-asked-questions.html#a5) that are usually considered universal (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_with_universal_health_care).
Effective: Is the value (quality of life improvements gained from the medical procedures made available) per expenditure (financial, bureaucratic, government power precedent, all kinds) greater than available alternatives (the current U.S. system, other foreign non-universal systems, proposals being made by the current U.S. congress, etc.).
