Is the phrase \u201c...to stop them messing with your day\u201d grammatically correct? My kids watch this show on Disney Junior called PJ Masks, and in every episode a narrator comes on and utters the phrase \u201c...to stop them messing with your day.\u201d In one of the episodes a character even says something like \u201cI\u2019m gonna stop her messing up the city.\u201d It drives me nuts. I have never heard of anyone using this phrasing (as opposed to \"...stop them from messing\" up...\"). Is this grammatically correct, and where does this come from?
