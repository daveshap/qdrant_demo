WOODWARD: --there had to be a White House overseer--
BERNSTEIN: --Colson.
SLOAN: Colson's too smart to get directly involved with something like that.
WOODWARD: Haldeman. Right?
SLOAN: I won't talk about the other two.
BERNSTEIN: But they both worked at the White House?
SLOAN: I will not talk about the other two.
BERNSTEIN: Kalmbach--Nixon's personal lawyer.
SLOAN: I can't say anything, I'm sorry.
WOODWARD: One thing I'm not completely clear on--when you gave out the money to Liddy, how did that work?
SLOAN: Badly. You don't realize how close all this came to staying undiscovered--I gave Liddy the Dahlberg check and he gave it to Barker who took it to Miami and deposited it.
BERNSTEIN: Right.
SLOAN: Then Barker withdrew the 25 thousand in hundred dollar bills and gave it back to Liddy who gave it back to me and I put it in the office safe which was crammed.
WOODWARD: Go on.
SLOAN: Well, when Liddy came and asked for money for what turned out to be the break-in funds, I went to the safe and gave him--out of this whole fortune--I happened to give him the same hundreds he gave me--banks have to keep track of hundreds. If the money had been in fifties, or if I'd grabbed a different stack, there probably wouldn't have been any Watergate story.
BERNSTEIN: Ordinarily, though, what was the procedure?
SLOAN: Routine--I'd just call John Mitchell over at the Justice Department and he'd say go ahead
BERNSTEIN: What happens when the baby comes?
SLOAN: We're moving. I've been looking for a job but it's been... hard. My name's been in the papers too much. Sometimes I wonder if reporters understand how much pain they can inflict in just one sentence. I'm not thinking of myself. But my wife, my parents, it's been very rough on them.
