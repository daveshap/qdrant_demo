To the person who outd me as transgender [Update]
I send my last post to her via Facebook. She flat out denied telling anyone and blamed my other, much closer friends I also told for outing me. She was lying through her teeth and it showed. Basically trying to gaslight me. She said I was being rude to her for no reason and starts to berate me. I blocked her - I don't want her in my life.


I'm still pretty stunned. She's totally not a shitty teenager who made a terrible mistake. She is an unapologetic sociopath. Did not give a fuck about me and used my trust for trivial gossip for people I don't even know. What a crazy bitch!


Her life will go downhill at some point with her sociopathy - she'll simply fuck over the wrong people
