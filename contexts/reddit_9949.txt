Recent grad school graduate Looking for a position in programming, advice and leads are welcome! More details in comments. THANKS!
Hello Everyone,
     So here is the situation, I graduated with my M.Ed, in Curriculum and Instruction in the Spring on 2011. The hiring market for secondary public education isn't in the best shape, so I found a desk gig with the Student Life Office at a community college. I never saw myself doing this kind of work, but I have abosolutely fallen in love with the sort of event planning, hands on working with student leaders, and other general awesomeness that comes with student activities. My family and I have decided to strike our fortune, for the sake of adventure, and I'm now in the market for some sort student activities position as a 4 year institution somehwere in the US. I realize my graduate work doesn't relate directly to the field, but I do have a year of full time experience, plus I had a part time position during my undergraduate years doing academic event planning/execution. Any advice/leads reddit?

I'll be more than happy to offer an update, when something pans out :)

Bonus Points: We are looking for a college with a graduate program in early childhood education (for my wife), so that would be extra awesome!
