CAROL: So what are you doing with a dog?
MELVIN: Suckered in. Set up. Pushed around.
CAROL: You're not worried that someone might take him?
MELVIN: Well, not until now -- for Christ's sake.
CAROL: Sorry.
MELVIN: It's okay -- I'll sit here.
CAROL: You know he's a little dog. Next time, if Bryan's not here, you can bring him in.
MELVIN: How old are you?
CAROL: Oh, please...
MELVIN: If I had to guess by your eyes, I'd say you were fifty.
CAROL: And if I had to guess by your eyes. I'd say you were kind. So, so much for eyes. But as long as you bring up age... how old are you?
MELVIN: Otherwise, you're not ugly.
CAROL: Okay, pal... I accept the compliment, but go easy -- my knees start a-knocking when you turn on the charm full blast.
MELVIN: What's with the dark?
