Anyone also getting suicidal thoughts when seeing happy stuff?
Kind of a question rather than a suicide post but I just needed to get this off my mind.

So, whenever my friends send me cute stuff of their friends to them, or just happy/cute things, I immediately think about killing myself, and I'm honestly not sure why. Anyone else has them too?
