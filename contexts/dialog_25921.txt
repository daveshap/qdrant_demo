RACHEL: Jackie, if I thought for one moment...
JACKIE: You listen carefully because I am only going to say this once. That woman has nothing more to do with my children.
LUKE: Our children.
JACKIE: Do you realize what could have hap- pened to your son today? How lucky we are the police found him before some lunatic did? He could have been...
LUKE: But he hasn't. He wandered off. I know it's terrifying. I can imagine how you felt when that call came -- But it happens.
JACKIE: Not to me.
LUKE: Jackie, you've made mistakes -- We all make mistakes --
JACKIE: I'm not gonna wait around to see the next one. I'm not gonna watch my kids fall through the cracks of this arrangement. I'm seeing a lawyer.
LUKE: Jackie stop. We promised we never go there.
JACKIE: We've broken a lot of promises, haven't we Luke?
RACHEL: Why are you taking this out on <u>him</u>?
LUKE: Rache, get out of th...
RACHEL: You haven't done <u>one</u> goddam thing to make any of this easier...
JACKIE: I am not <u>here</u> to make it easier for you. These are <u>my</u> children. They don't want to <u>be</u> with you.
RACHEL: Well, maybe they would if they thought it was okay, with y...
JACKIE: A court <u>order</u> is gonna say that <u>woman</u> is <u>never</u> <u>alone</u> with my children! Ever <u>again</u>! Do you HEAR that?

BEN: I don't <u>want</u> to be Lady Godiva anymore, no matter <u>how</u> much I like chocolate. I want to be a stud.
JACKIE: Lord Nelson, Napoleon's troops. I fear for the women and the property values.
ANNABELLE: I'll ride ahead. Nelson, protect the Queen...
BEN: Mommy? It's not Rachel's fault I ran away.
JACKIE: No, that's your fault. It's her fault for not watching over my precious son, as if it were her priority. Which means, the most important job.
BEN: Rachel's job is she works.
JACKIE: Ben, mommies work too. They work very hard. Mommy works harder as a mom than she did when she was working. I just don't get paid.
BEN: Does Rachel make a lot of money?
JACKIE: People like Rachel who only think about themselves often do make a lot of money.
BEN: I think she's pretty, Mommy.
JACKIE: Yes...if you like big hair...
BEN: Mommy?
JACKIE: What honey?
BEN: If you want me to hate her I will.
