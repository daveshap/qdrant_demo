How do I ask my boss for the raise I was promised
OK I need some advice when I started my job which I had worked at previously and they said whenever I wanted to come back I always could I asked what they would be starting me at and they asked me what I was looking for I told him that I had another job offer starting me at $12-$13 an hour the owner of the company said they could easily meet that no problem well they started me at $11 an hour fast forward after my three month probation and they’ve raised me only $.50 so I am currently at 11.50 an hour and my husband keeps pressuring me to either quit And find a better paying job or ask for my raise up to 12 or $13 an hour but they said that they would be doing I love my job and I love what I do I do not want to quit any advice on how I can approach the owner to bring up the subject of hey when I originally came to apply for the job we agreed on such and such and I’m still not there?
