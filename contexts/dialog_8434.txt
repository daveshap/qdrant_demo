BRENDA: Tony Marvin.
ED: Oh, Jesus. Who's responsible for his pain and suffering this time?
BRENDA: His dry cleaners. You want him?
ED: What do you think? What's this?
BRENDA: Tequila. From your drug dealer friend.
ED: Carlos isn't a friend; he's a client.
BRENDA: He's a low-life. Speaking of which, that's your nine o'clock in there.
ED: Whoa. Remind me.
BRENDA: Erin Brockovich. Car accident. Not her fault, she says. And she looks like such an honest girl, don't you think?
ED: You shouldn't judge, Brenda.
BRENDA: Right. Lap-dancers are people too.
