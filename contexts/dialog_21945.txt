FATHER: You awake?
JIM: Yes.
FATHER: Listen--I took a steak out of the freezer. I thought we could have a real old-fashioned stag party--just the two of us, what do you say?
JIM: I'm not hungry.
JIM: Hey--I want to ask you something.
FATHER: Shoot, Jimbo.
JIM: Suppose you knew that you had to do something very dangerous--where you have to prove something you need to know--a question of honor. Would you do it?
FATHER: Is there some kind of trick answer?
JIM: What would you do, Dad?
FATHER: I wouldn't do anything hasty. Let's get a little light on the subject.
JIM: Blood.
FATHER: How'd that happen! What kind of trouble you in?
JIM: The kind we've been talking about. Can you answer me now?
FATHER: Listen--nobody should make a snap decision--This isn't something you just--we ought to consider all the pros and cons--
JIM: We don't have time.
FATHER: We'll make time. Where's some paper. We'll make a list and if we're still stuck then we ought to get some advice--
JIM: What can you do when you have to be a man?
FATHER: Well, now--
JIM: Just give me a direct answer! You going to stop me from going, Dad?
FATHER: You know I never stop you from anything. Believe me--you're at a wonderful age. In ten years you'll look back on this and wish you were a kid again.
JIM: Ten years? Now, Dad--I need an answer now!
FATHER: I just want to show you how foolish you are. When you're older you'll laugh at yourself for thinking this is so important--
