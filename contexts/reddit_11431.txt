What my coworkers don't know...
Today, I put in my two weeks notice and an announcement went out to the company.

I don't have a job lined up. I don't have a concrete plan. I have my investments of knowledge and a cushion to find myself.

What my coworkers don't know is that I'm not worried about any of this. That place is political hell and I decided I can't live like that anymore. That new opportunities were on the other side of the door waiting for me to pursue them.

Am I nervous? A bit.
Am I scared? A bit.
Am I excited?... yes. Very

The world is a huge place and I'm excited to explore it. Things can go very wrong very quickly with any plan of action. So why not take some risks? 

When my coworkers ask what opportunity I am heading to and they react in a judging fashion about me heading to unemployment I am undeterred. I feel sorry for them! not me. I had the courage to take a leap of faith in myself. 

I could fail hard. But I could also win big. Either way the end result will be me exploring life.
