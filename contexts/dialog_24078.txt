MOTHER SUPERIOR: And on such an occasion, I feel a completely traditional program will be best.
CHRISTY: What do you mean?
MOTHER SUPERIOR: The council of Cardinals is perhaps the most esteemed body in the entire Catholic church. They command the utmost respect. Your more... secular entertainment would be wholly out of place.
MARY PATRICK: But, Reverend Mother -- everyone loves our new style.
MARY ROBERT: It's brought people back to the church.
CHRISTY: Isn't that why we were asked to sing for those Cardinals?
MOTHER SUPERIOR: I believe this can be settled by a simple vote.
CHRISTY: A vote?
MOTHER SUPERIOR: Of course. Mary Clarence, a convent is not a totalitarian state. Most major decisions are made by the membership as a whole. A membership that, I am certain, will vote in a rational and pious manner. All those in favor of allowing Mary Clarence to select a program?
CHRISTY: But... wait a minute...
MOTHER SUPERIOR: The majority has spoken.
