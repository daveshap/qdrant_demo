Are there any examples of US states taxing foreign real estate investments as a way to curve rising home costs? If so what were the effects?
 Some 2 years ago several prominent Canadian cities started enacting  various levels of taxes on foreign real estate buyers, Toronto was the  first notable city to do so, imposing a [15% tax on foreign real estate buyers](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/apr/20/toronto-foreign-tax-homes-housing-market-canada)  with the hopes of controlling the price of housing considering that  foreign investment had been on the rise for several years. The most  notable of the foreign buyers are the growing number of Chinese  investors which are [reshaping the market in Canada](https://www.macleans.ca/economy/economicanalysis/chinese-real-estate-investors-are-reshaping-the-market/), and the [United States.](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/08/chinese-middle-class-buying-up-american-residential-real-estate.html) Some of the more notable housing shortages in the US have been the Californian housing shortage, which has been the cause of a [180,000 yearly housing construction shortage](https://calmatters.org/explainers/housing-costs-high-california/). A more recent example which has slowly been creeping up has been a [shortage of affordable housing  in Florida as well](https://www.sun-sentinel.com/opinion/editorials/fl-editorial-affordable-housing-crisis-20170519-story.html). Now [some media outlets](https://globalnews.ca/news/3636579/vancouver-foreign-homebuyers-tax-one-year-anniversary/) have found that  the tax was effective in [short term reductions in home prices](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/real-estate/the-market/canada-housing-reform-impact-foreign-buyers/article35854598/),  and home buying, but isn't an effective long term solution considering  that home prices slowly creeped up in the following years. What are some  other models from other countries that have tried to curb foreign real  estate investment?
