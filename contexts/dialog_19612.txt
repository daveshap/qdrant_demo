SIMMS: We'll begin sedation tonight. Starting with him.
NANCY: You can't! They'll be defenseless against their dreams.
SIMMS: That's precisely what they need. Some uninterrupted REM sleep to release all this negative energy.
NANCY: Neil, please --
NEIL: Elizabeth, I'm prescribing Hypnocyl. It's a dream suppressant.
SIMMS: I know what it is. I just can't believe what I'm hearing. What has she talked you into?
NEIL: Nothing. They're my patients. It's my decision. I want the dreams stopped until we get some answers.
SIMMS: I won't allow it.
NEIL: I'll go straight to Carver if I have to. He'll either back me up or accept my resignation.
