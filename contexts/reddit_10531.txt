I've meticulously planned everything to the last detail, but whenever they ask me if I have a plan I say no
Such a useless question. You can spend 45 minutes talking about how much you wanna die but if you answer no to that one question they don't think it's serious. If you DO say yes they take all your stuff and lock you in a room where you're nothing but a barcode (a literal barcode on your wrist) that they can scan to make sure your misery is expensive enough. 


Then you lie your way out and go back to the world feeling the exact same way at best, but more likely a lot worse. 


Mental health care is an absolute joke. It's literally just trial and error and if anyone says differently they're lying. Not only that but they're incentivized to make it take as long as possible so healthcare companies make more money. 


Doctors have been throwing shit at the wall and seeing what sticks for 5 years for me and nothing has. No medicine, therapy, group, whatever. Literally nothing has worked and nothing will.


I wanna just throw all my bullshit waste of money meds in the trash, hop in my car and drive across the country and kill myself there if I have to.
