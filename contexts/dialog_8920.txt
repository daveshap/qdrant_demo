FRANK: Thank you, thank you. You know, Susie and Jack and I only just arrived here yesterday, but already the people here at the King Corporation's Moorish Manor have made us feel, well, a part of the family. And it's their hope that, before you leave, everyone of you will feel a part of that family also. So, if during-the next few days, we should happen to pass one another in the hallway or in the lobby or wherever ... don't be a stranger. Stop. Say hello. Introduce yourself. Because here, there are no strangers, only friends. And family. Right, Jack?
JACK: Right. I love you, Frank.
FRANK: What?
JACK: I love you. I just wanted to say it.
FRANK: Uh, well, I love you, too, Jack. So. Susie. How 'bout it.
SUSIE: Huh?
FRANK: Got another song for us?
SUSIE: Oh. Yeah. I gotta bunch of them.
FRANK: Well then ... shall we?
FRANK: What's the matter with you?
JACK: I'm sorry, Frank. All that talk about family. I just got emotional.
FRANK: How dare you say you love me.
JACK: It won't happen again. Scout's honor.
SUSIE: What's with you guys?
FRANK: Someone needs to grow up. I won't take it, Jack.
