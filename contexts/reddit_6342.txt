Please stop the internship optimism
After reading [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/20rndr/my_parents_dont_seem_to_be_able_to_get_it_through/) about an intern seeking his parents' approval, I feel the need to reach out to my fellow Millennials on the issue of internships. 

Background: I'm 24. I had ***11*** internships. I have an MA and I'm at my first fulltime job. Internships suck, companies are taking advantage of people, etc etc. But we (Gen Y) need to reflect a little on ourselves. This is the kind of thing that bothers me: One girl recently told *[The Week](http://theweek.com/article/index/242065/america-is-raising-a-generation-of-interns)*,  “You either do what you like to do for free or you have an entry-level job for $25,000 where you answer the phone and are someone's assistant.” This kind of attitude is a problem. Internships largely do not lead to a job. According to *[this study](http://www.naceweb.org/s05292013/paid-unpaid-interns-job-offer.aspx),* 

> 63.1 percent of paid interns received at least one job offer. In comparison, only 37 percent of unpaid interns got an offer; that’s not much better than results for those with no internship—35.2 percent received at least one job offer.

As young people, we've been raised on the idea that if we try hard enough, we can do anything. We're tumbling into an internship spiral, and we can't afford it. 

Now our parents would say that we should just create our own businesses. And once again, that's a misunderstanding of our generation. Part of the reason why we go through so many internships is because *we desperately want to be accepted into existing institutions.* We're *scared to death* of entrepreneurship.  But here's the thing: Unless you want to get underpaid for a job you're overqualified for (there's nothing wrong with that, but I'm assuming that you're taking an internship in the hope of getting something better), or want another internship, that is your option.
