CAPTAIN CHEONG: In the Strait of Malacca, when a boat is even five minutes late, one begins to worry, Mr. Bond.
BOND: I know. Pirates from Sumatra want the cargo; smugglers from Thailand and Burma want the ships.
CAPTAIN CHEONG: Sometimes kill the crew; other times - Torture them.
BOND: I'm sorry.
CAPTAIN CHEONG: The Kuala Lumpur ferry was 35 miles off-course that night. Captain blamed the auto-pilot; I suspected he was drunk - until the Sumatra ferry captain had same problem.
BOND: Did you test the auto-pilots? The satellite positioning receiver?
CAPTAIN CHEONG: Next morning. Both boats. Nothing wrong. My 90 year old grandfather thinks 'Ghost in the computer - Silicon Dragon.'
BOND: I appreciate your time -
CAPTAIN CHEONG: Maybe you should talk to Sidney Winch. Owns a marine salvage company. Nobody knows more about the Strait.
BOND: Where can I find him?
CAPTAIN CHEONG: Him? He, is a she - at the bar.
SIDNEY: Bourbon. Neat.
BOND: I wonder if you handle your liquor more carefully than you handle your boat.
SIDNEY: Sometimes, you just have to plunge into things. Be reckless.
BOND: - And I bet you always leave turmoil in your wake.
SIDNEY: Have we met?
BOND: This afternoon. Our boats practically kissed in the harbor. James Bond.
SIDNEY: Sidney Winch.
BOND: Vodka martini, shaken not stirred. And another for you?
SIDNEY: No. But you can buy a drink for my friend, Taro.
BOND: Boyfriend?
SIDNEY: Chaperone. I'm waiting for my dinner date.
BOND: Pity. Bring him whatever he wants.
SIDNEY: So what brings you to Kuala Lumpur, Mr. Bond? Wait - don't tell me: Unhappy marriage? Running from some poor little girl with two kids and a Chanel pocketbook in - London?
BOND: Actually, I'm here on business. You might say it was a... Golden opportunity.
SIDNEY: And exactly what business are you in, Mr. Bond?
BOND: Insurance. Lloyds of London.
SIDNEY: The Strait can be a very dangerous place, Mr. Bond. A few words scribbled on a piece of paper in London doesn't carry a lot of value out here. Including life insurance.
BOND: I'll keep that in mind.
SIDNEY: I see my date is here. And I think Mr. Bond is ready to leave.
BOND: Nice to run into you again.
SIDNEY: Let's not make it a habit.
