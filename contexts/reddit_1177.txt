Anyone else get that gut feeling that it’s gonna be a bad day and the anxiety just flairs up?
I feel this right now. I have to work again tomorrow and I feel like I’m gonna log on to my laptop and then see a bunch of “negative” messages from senior workers. 

This job has caused me enough stress that my anxiety has skyrocketed. The amount of anxiety attacks I get, oh boy. I know the solution would be to leave but I can’t afford that right now. 

But does anyone else always get this gut feeling like oh hey today’s gonna be a bad day and then it actually does?
