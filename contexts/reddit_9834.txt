How much does going to a top grad school matter for a Student Affairs career?
Hello All! 

I am currently working in marketing/communications in an admissions office for a mid-sized public university. I would like to transition to a more student-involved role over time. At the school I work for, I get a great education benefit. I could essentially get a Masters in Higher Ed Admin for a 90% discount. The one thing is, the degree program is fairly young and hasn't built much of a reputation for itself thus far. (It seems like a decent program, it's just that the Ed department is not a household name by any means.) 

My question is: if I am trying to kick-off a dynamic career in SA, will the reputation of the institution in which I earned my MA matter significantly? Are potential SA employers very prestige-conscious like they are in fields such as law/business?
