A video I think everyone should watch.
Hey guys. I originally came here to post about lady troubles I've been having to get my feelings out, and I might still do that, but after reading through some posts I thought I would share a little something I do to cheer myself up in times of sadness.

For a period of well over a month after these lady troubles started I would start off every day watching this video while I drank my morning coffee, and it has made me a far cheerier person. Even now I watch it when Im down. Even after so many viewings it manages to lighten the burden a little.

I hope this helps. Pay special attention to the latter half where he talks about silly ways to cheer yourself up. They help more than you think.
