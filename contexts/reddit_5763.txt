54 and starting over.
I'm 54 and have been with the same company for 28 years. I am a Compliance Specialist and due to changing regulations and technology the writing on the wall is my job will be eliminated in a few months. As I look for comparable jobs in the same field they require a college degree that I don't have. In company my experience and work knowledge was enough for me to progress up to a managers position for several years( that position was eliminated a few years back). I always thought I would finish my career at 64, however the changes in the industry have put that goal at risk. So where do I start ?
