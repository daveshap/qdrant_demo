ELLIE: Yes, I guess I have. I don't want to hurt anybody any more. I want to get away from all this front page publicity. It suddenly strikes me as being cheap and loathsome. I can't walk out on King now. It'll make us all look so ridiculous. Besides, what difference does it make? I'll never see Peter again.
ANDREWS: Is that his name?
ELLIE: Yes. Peter Warne.
ANDREWS: Peter Warne!
ELLIE: Why? Do you know him?
ANDREWS: Oh, no—no.
ELLIE: You haven't heard from him, have you, Dad?
ANDREWS: Why, no . . . Don't be silly.
ELLIE: Oh, please, Dad—
ELLIE: Looks like that was his only interest in me. The reward.
ANDREWS: I'm sorry you read it.
ELLIE: Are you going to see him?
ANDREWS: I suppose so.
ELLIE: Certainly! Pay him off. He's entitled to it. He did an excellent job. Kept me thoroughly entertained. It's worth every penny he gets.
