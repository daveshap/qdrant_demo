CHERYL: What the heck are those for?
MELVIN: No. No. Get Carol.
CHERYL: I'm filling in. We don't know if she's coming back. She might have to get a job closer to home.
MELVIN: What are you trying to do to me?
CHERYL: What the heck do you mean?
MELVIN: Hey, elephant girl, call her or something... just let her do my one meal here. I'll pay whatever. I'll wait. Do it!!!
