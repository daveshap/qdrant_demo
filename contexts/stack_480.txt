How to get screen output from a background python program I'm running a home heating system monitor on a BeagleBoard xM (arm7) using Ubuntu 16.04.2 and Python 2.7.12. My Python program auto runs on boot via a cron job. The board runs headless. I access it using WinSCP to get my data file and Putty to check on things. Everything is working fine, but I would like to have my current sensor readings auto print to a screen. I'm not sure how to do this, since my program runs headless in the background. By screen, I mean either a small hdmi monitor I could attach to the board (in which case it would be in a different session without a keyboard) or a new terminal session I would start via Putty.So, my question is there a way to get screen output from a background program automatically to a screen in a different terminal session?
