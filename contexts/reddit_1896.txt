I got matched to Yale
Words can't express my emotion. Honestly don't even know what's going on.

Edit: Wow this thread blew up. I'll try to respond to any reasonable questions or comments you peeps have, thanks for being so supportive. 

Edit 2: Did someone gild this?!? I'm sorry but I'm obligated: Thanks for the gold kind stranger!! First gold on Reddit, thanks :))

Edit 3: Still live in the thread in case anyone has more questions or such. I know I would have appreciated talking to someone when I was still struggling through apps.
