Would you get your masters if the company provided no financial relief?
I am looking to further my education in hopes to pay dividends later on in life in regards to opportunities/salary.

I am 25 and entered the work force after getting my BS in Economics. I have built up around 3 years of experience and am looking to pursue my masters, online preferred, to separate myself among peers. 

The question I have is, would you pursue your masters if your firm did not help at all? I have heard many people recommend going for a masters only if the company helps. I have also heard that going for a masters is beneficial if you are looking to change the course of your career (I am an Econ major working in the Accounting dept. No desire to pursue an entire career surrounding accounting)

The biggest obstacle, along with everyone else, is if the payoff exceeds the cost. Has a masters propelled your career? If you got it while in the workforce, would you have gotten it without any financial relief?

I am eager to learn more about Econ and challenge myself to complete a masters program. Just want to make sure it will pay off at the end, especially on zero discount.

Appreciate the help everyone
