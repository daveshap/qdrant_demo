This might be weird but......
How do you get your crush to notice you??? I meet him in school and he is just one grade level below me. We were in the same gym class and we were a group that is how I meet him. We talk and do jokes and I started to like him. At the end of school I gave him my phone number had the confidence and we do text once a while. We also work in the same place and I see him there too though we work different departments. I really like him but Iâ€™m too shy and scare to get rejected many people have told me to go ask him but I have social anxiety so it does not help just want some advice if there is a way he might notice me or see that I have interest in him 
Thanks :)
