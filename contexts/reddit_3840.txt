Totally smitten and overwhelmed
I have been going to a social meetup once a week and I feel like I have just met that 1 in 1,000,000,000 person. Its so serendipitous. I cant express how I feel. Its like I am weightless and walking on clouds. I have been out of the dating world for 5 years, having dated 2 girls for 2 years each back in university. There girls were in my friend group so we didnt really date; it just kind of fell into place. 

I definitely get a reciprocal vibe from her. There is tons of blushing, nonsensical laughing and kind of blank staring for long periods of time. After struggling with crippling anxiety for years, its like a massive weight lifted. I now have no idea how to proceed. Although we get along, I definitely feel my nerves creeping up. Its like a nervous excitement. I want to share this and express my interest but am not sure how to proceed without it being desperate.  Im running around like a chicken with my head cut off
