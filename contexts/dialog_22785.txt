SAL: And another thing. Your attitude toward Anglos. If you're gonna be a leader ...
RAMÓN: What attitude?
SAL: You lump them all together -- Anglo workers and Anglo bosses.
RAMÓN: He's a guest in my house, isn't he?
SAL: Sure. But you want the truth? You're even suspicious of him.
RAMÓN: Maybe. I think he's got a few things to learn about our people.
FRANK: Go on. Spill it.
RAMÓN: Well, you're the organizer. You work out strike strategy -- and most of the time you're dead right. But when you figure everything the rank-and-file's to do down to the last detail, you don't give us anything to think about. You afraid we're too lazy to take initiative?
FRANK: You know I don't think that.
RAMÓN: Maybe not. But there's another thing ... like when you came in tonight -- I heard you ask your wife, Who's that? His grandfather?""
