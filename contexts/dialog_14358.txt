JEZZIE: Jake!
JACOB: How's it going?
JACOB: I'm going home.
JEZZIE: What's wrong?
JACOB: I don't know. One of these days, I'm gonna see Louis. My back's killing me.
JEZZIE: Now? What about the boss? He's not gonna like it.
JEZZIE: Well, I'll miss riding home with you. I was looking forward to it.
JACOB: I'll be glad to avoid the crush.
JEZZIE: I enjoy crushing into you.
