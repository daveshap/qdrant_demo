DAVID: You're not real.
JACK: Don't be an asshole, David. Come here.
DAVID: What are you doing here?
JACK: I wanted to see you.
DAVID: Okay, you've seen me. Now go away.
JACK: David, I'm sorry I upset you yesterday, but you must understand what is going on.
DAVID: I understand all right. You're one of the undead and I'm a werewolf.
JACK: Yes.
DAVID: Get out of here, Jack!
JACK: David, tomorrow night is the full moon. You'll change, you'll become...
DAVID: A monster. I know, I know.
JACK: You must take your own life now, David, before it's too late.
DAVID: Jack, are you really dead?
JACK: What do you think?
DAVID: I think I've lost my mind. I think you're not real. I think I'm asleep and you're a part of another bad dream.
JACK: You must believe me.
DAVID: What, Jack? That tomorrow night beneath the full moon I'll sprout hair and fangs and eat people? Bullshit!
JACK: The canines will be real. You'll taste real blood! God damit, David, please believe me! You'll kill and make others like me! I'm not having a nice time, David! Don't allow this to happen again! You must take your own life!
DAVID: I will not accept this! Now go away!
