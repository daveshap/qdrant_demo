What are the pros and cons of legislating the outsourcing of jobs?
US job creation/preservation is a common theme in politics regardless of party affiliation. For example, [Trump has recently been pressuring Carrier to keep some 2000 jobs in the US instead of moving them to Mexico](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/25/business/international/trump-leans-on-carrier-to-keep-2000-us-jobs-from-moving-to-mexico.html?_r=0), and meanwhile [Sanders is talking about proposing legislation to keep jobs in the US](http://thehill.com/policy/finance/economy/307579-sanders-pressures-trump-with-anti-outsourcing-legislation).

Typically the political discourse seems to center on keeping jobs in the US, and yet there are obviously market factors which makes outsourcing attractive (or it wouldn't happen). What are the pros and cons of legislating the outsourcing of jobs?
