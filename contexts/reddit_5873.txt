Human Resources or Higher Ed?
I am currently an office manager for a department at a SEC university. My employer would pay for me to get a master's degree. I am looking at two master's program: Higher Education Administration or Human Resources. I like to work with students in a non-faculty capacity, but I soon realizes that most student affairs positions are very competitive to get, overworked, and underpaid. But, for HR, I am doing quite a bit of HR stuff for my department, but I don't know if it is a demanding field or saturated like in student affairs.

Which direction should I proceed? If there's another path you think I can go, let me know. Thank you!
