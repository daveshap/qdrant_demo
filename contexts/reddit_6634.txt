Is it wrong to cancel an interview made through an agency?
So I just got reminded of this, and wanted to get some feedback. The same agency is contacting me, albeit a different rep, and I want to check if I should avoid.

This agency contacted me when I was looking for temp work, offering a role similar to the job I'd just left. The only problem was it was a few towns over, and I knew from experience that traffic heading into that town could be bad. I voiced my concern with that but the rep was saying 'oh no, that'll be fine. Anyway, can I make the appointment for 10am next Wednesday? I'll send you the job overview and interview prep.Thanks!'

He sent a few bullet points for the job description. No interview prep, no description of the company, nothing. Usually you'd at least get a 'these are links to the company' information. I looked that stuff up on my own and realised that the company was on the opposite side of the town. So to get to it, I'd need to go through the one way system in the town, which at rush hour can take a good half hour on it's own. On top of that, the job description was well above anything I'd done before, more then I was qualified for at the time. I'd had an interview offer for a job that was closer to home and much more suitable.

I called the guy the following day (Friday) and got his voicemail. Ok, fine. I left a message saying that I didn't believe the job would be suitable, gave my reasons, and confirmed that I wouldn't be attending the interview. I also emailed him just in case.

He didn't respond until the Tuesday, when he called at 6pm to tell me it was unprofessional to not attend an interview. I replied that I'd told him with a few days notice and my reasoning. He just huffed and ended the call.

I'm really nervous about dealing with them again after that. Can anyone provide advice?
