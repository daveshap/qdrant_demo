RANT: Okay, this has to be a joke... "Candidate should have a minimum of 15 year’s work experience in the software development industry. $50,000."
Like many of you I'm struggling to land a meaningful job. Currently in Broadcasting, trying to change careers.

I stumbled across this beauty today and laughed, this is by far the worst I've seen of a job wanting it all, but refusing to pay.

**Fast Growing Software Start-up**

The prospective candidate should have a minimum of 15 year’s work experience in the software development industry.

10+ year’s software development experience with 5+ years in a senior management position
5+ years CTO/COO or equivalent role experience

Salary: $50,000.00 /year


This salary, in my area is pretty entry level stuff, not to mention the software industry typically pays better here. 



For example I found this 

**INTERMEDIATE SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT**

4-5 years development experience required

Salary: $70,000 a year.


I've been looking to move industries, and have been thinking of going back to school. But man oh man if this becomes a thing, 15 years = 50K I'll stick with broadcasting.
