Ola Index and Update stats I wanted to ask what is the proper way to run the index maintannace ola script.Do you include @UpdateStatistics = 'Y', and @OnlyModifiedStatistics = 'Y'?The reason I ask is that wherever I read, everyone says not to update statistics after an index rebuild.  From what I am seeing, with those two options highly fragmented or indexes that could not be reorganized, that were rebuild would have their stats updated (excluding column stats) and than updating stats again would update the stats.Would it be better to update stats in a different job, ran at a different time/day or is it fin to include those options?
