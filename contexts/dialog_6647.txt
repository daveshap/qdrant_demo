SOPHIE: You like shoes?
SAMI: No, I like the bag. It would be good for the job tonight.
SOPHIE: It belongs to Vincent Bastaldi. He left it last time he was here. I'm sure he wouldn't mind if you used it.
SOPHIE: So, how did you get hooked up with these guys?
SAMI: Just lucky I guess. How'd you start working for the Bastaldi's?
SOPHIE: The art world doesn't fully appreciate my talent yet. I needed some way to pay the rent. Laurant and Vincent pay well for information.
SAMI: So you arranged to have the people you worked for robbed?
SOPHIE: They're not nice people.
