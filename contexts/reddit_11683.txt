Please be alive and okay..
Sorry for language..

What the fuck? No, really, what the FUCK? Six months ago you and I were best friends, and now you're a missing poster on every wall, plastic bag, and all over my Facebook. "A danger to herself" with "Scars up and down her arms, self inflicted" in the description box.. So many months after she even went missing. I don't know if it was those bureaucratic fucks in the police, or her abusive and neglectful parents but jesus christ.. "Missing since December 14" and posted YESTERDAY. Three FUCKING months.. she could be dead you fuckers! Last time I talked to her she was recovering from a schizophrenic attack, anorexia, and bipolar disorder. Hearing all of these people I live around, people we went to school with, people WE knew acting like she doesn't matter. They just go on about their days like she isn't missing.. She might be dead for all I know.. and if by some miracle, you are reading this Cherokee.. Please come home.. even if you go to jail, I want you to be safe. I love you and miss you so much
