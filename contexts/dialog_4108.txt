CESAR: Hmm. I see. Will there be clothes in the suitcase?
GEORGE: What? Yeah, sure.
CESAR: Whose cloths? Your clothes?
GEORGE: My clothes, your clothes. What does it matter?
CESAR: I would like to know the contents. Every detail is important.
GEORGE: What are we doing here, Diego? This guy's a clown. He's talking about clothes.
CESAR: I demand to know everything. I do not trust six-hundred thousand dollars of coca to someone I don't know.
GEORGE: It's a lousy fifteen kilos. I piss fifteen kilos.
CESAR: The coca is my responsibility!
GEORGE: You're a fucking amateur!
