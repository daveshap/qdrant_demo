How can you compute sample size for a linear mixed model? G*Power only does repeated measures ANOVA I read everywhere that repeated measures ANOVA is inferior to mixed modelling (since it doesn't handle missing data as well and relies on sphericity assumption). G*Power doesn't tell you how to compute sample sizes for linear mixed models. Should I just do the calculation for RM-ANOVA and go with that number?My study is: one group takes drug A, another drug B (blinded), surveys with a few continuous questions are given at 5 follow up appointments.
