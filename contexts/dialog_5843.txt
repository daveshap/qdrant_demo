CURLY: She's just no good.
GITTES: What can I tell you, Kid? You're right. When you're right, you're right, and you're right.
CURLY: Ain't worth thinking about.
GITTES: You're absolutely right, I wouldn't give her another thought.
CURLY: You know, you're okay, Mr. Gittes. I know it's your job, but you're okay.
GITTES: Thanks, Curly. Call me Jake.
CURLY: Thanks. You know something, Jake?
GITTES: What's that, Curly?
CURLY: I think I'll kill her.
