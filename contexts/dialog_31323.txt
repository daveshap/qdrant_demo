TIN MAN: Oh - oh, poor Dorothy!
SCARECROW: Don't cry -- you'll rust yourself again!
LION: Comin' to think of it, forty winks wouldn't be bad.
SCARECROW: Don't you start it, too!
TIN MAN: Oh! We ought to try and carry Dorothy.
SCARECROW: I don't think I could, but we could try.
TIN MAN: Let's.
SCARECROW: Yes.
TIN MAN: Oh -- now look at him! This is terrible!
SCARECROW: Here, Tin Man -- help me.
SCARECROW: Oh, this is terrible -- can't budge her an inch! This is a spell, this is!
TIN MAN: It's the Wicked Witch! What'll we do? Help! HELP!
SCARECROW: It's no use screaming at a time like this! Nobody will hear you! Help!
