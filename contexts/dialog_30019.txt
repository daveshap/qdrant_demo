BOBBY: That's my gun... That fucking Darrell!
JAKE: I like Darrell. He may be an idiot, but he's my half brother. We own Harlin's together, yeah, that little redneck manages to get paid no matter how things work out.
JAKE: I guess this is what they call ironee"? Hunh?"
BOBBY: It's not what you think, Jake.
JAKE: No, but it don't matter anyway when you're lying there with your brains all over my carpet and I'm telling Sheriff Potter about this drifter, didn't have enough money to fix his car. And Darrell happened to find his gun, and through maybe this drifter heard old Jake got some money stashed away, and figgered he might try to break in and steal it!
BOBBY: Wait a minute. Just listen to me...
JAKE: ...And he thought he'd clock old Jake McKenna and turn his brains into wall paper...and then maybe borrow $200 or $20,000, or $200,000...
