What are currently used types of certificates and what they can be used for? There are a lot of different certificates. But how do they differ?There are certificates for \"code signing\". Certificates for SSL websites. Why WWW certificates cannot be used for code signing? For me, certificate is certificate and has public and private key. And (i think) all certificates are the same. What are types of certificates (most common) and how do they differ so one can't be used for other activities?Tried looking for comparision, but couldn't find any good source.
