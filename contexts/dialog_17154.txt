STANLEY: B-but... we saw... your neck...
ANDY: Nah, it's phony baloney -- I faked the whole thing. It didn't hurt at all. It was just a yoga move. I tucked my head in.
STANLEY: Andrew -- HOW DARE YOU!! For all we knew, you were DYING! Look at your mother -- she's still shaking!
ANDY: But that's it. I needed you to believe! Our family will be in the newspapers. People will look, and they'll be touched. Because your emotions were honest!
