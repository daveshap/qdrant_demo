College is too damn expensive
My family's at that awkward middle-class place where we're wealthy enough that I have no chance of getting any need-based aid but we can't actually afford expensive colleges. I toured Wellesley today and they have a gorgeous campus and I think I'd love going there, but there's no chance I can afford it and they don't do merit aid!! My other schools that I love are also 60-70k a year so let's hope I get accepted/get merit aid and local scholarships! God, I just want to graduate with minimal debt so let's hope something works out lmao.
