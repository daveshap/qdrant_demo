iOS 11.0.2 - AirDrop not showing up in Control Center even after long pressing the \"Network Icon Group\" in the Control Center Good day everyone, I have this iPhone unit which we updated to iOS 11.0.2. We were trying to AirDrop files to and from it, but we hit a snag when we were trying to go to the AirDrop control through the Control Center. It wasn't popping up even when we were long pressing the \"Network Icon Group\". Does anyone know why this happens?I know we can go to the Settings itself and search for AirDrop settings and turn it on, but it's so convenient to be able to turn it on and off from the Control Center.Any help is very much appreciated. Thanks.
