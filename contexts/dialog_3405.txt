MALKOVICH: Maxine...
CRAIG: I can't believe it. This is too good to be true.
CRAIG: You're glowing again.
MAXINE: A girl has a right to glow if she wants. It's in the fucking constitution.
CRAIG: It was lovely being you being Malkovich, my dear. I'd never seen the passionate side of sweet Maxine before, or her actual tits for that matter. If only, I've been thinking to myself, if only I could actually feel what Malkovich feels, rather than just see what he sees... And then, dare I say it, if only I could control his arms, his legs, his pelvis, and make them do my bidding.
LOTTE: It'll never happen, fuckface.
CRAIG: Ah, but you're forgetting one thing, Lambchop.
LOTTE: What's that?
CRAIG: I'm a puppeteer.
MAXINE: Lotte, this is so good...
CRAIG: Move right hand across her left breast now. Move right hand across her left breast now. Move right hand across her left breast now.
CRAIG: Holy shit, yes!
MALKOVICH: Holy shit, yes!
CRAIG: Holy shit! He said what I said!
MALKOVICH: Holy shit! He said what I said!
MAXINE: Lotte? Is that you?
CRAIG: Yes, yes, sweetheart, yes!
MALKOVICH: Yes, yes, sweetheart, yes! What the fuck is going on? I'm not talking. This is not me!
MAXINE: Oh, Lotte...
MALKOVICH: Something was making me talk. Some Goddamn thing was making me move. I gotta get out of here.
MAXINE: Oh, Dollface, it was just your passion for me taking hold.
MALKOVICH: No, Dollface, I know what my passion taking hold feels like. I gotta go.
