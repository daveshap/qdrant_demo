RIPLEY: But I hope that note goes to New York in your purse, for a rainy day.
MARGE: What are you going to do now, Tom?
RIPLEY: I don't know. Peter has a concert in Athens next month -- and he's asked if I want to go along, help out. He says goodbye by the way -- he's in rehearsal, otherwise --
MARGE: Why do I think there's never been a Ripley rainy day?
RIPLEY: What?
MARGE: I know it was you -- I know it was you, Tom. I know it was you. I know you killed Dickie. I know it was you.
RIPLEY: Oh Marge.
RIPLEY: Ask me what I want to change about this moment.
PETER: What do you want to change about this moment?
RIPLEY: Nothing.
PETER: Hello. What are you up to?
RIPLEY: All kinds of things. Making plans.
PETER: Plans -- good, plans for tonight or plans for the future?
RIPLEY: I don't know. Both. My plan right now is to go up on deck, look at the sunset. Come with me.
PETER: You go. I don't want to get dressed yet. Come back though. Come back. You know, you look so relaxed, like a completely different person.
RIPLEY: Well, that's entirely your fault. And, if I fall overboard, that'll be your fault too.
