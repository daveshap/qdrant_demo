How do you take decisions regarding your professional future as a researcher? Making a career in academia can be challenging and it's natural to feel like you don't see the complete picture. Building on the considerable experience in coaching researchers and the questions raised during a popular Researcher Academy [career module](https://researcheracademy.elsevier.com/career-path/job-search/make-phd-capabilities-find-fulfilling-jobs) of January 2019, Researcher Academy is presenting you a new, live module answering all your questions about making a career in research.

In this module, experts Ralph Rousseau and Chiat Cheong will present to you many opportunities that are suitable for PhD graduates and researchers. They will also discuss how to avoid adapting yourself to fit a specific job description and instead start to identify jobs that suit you.
