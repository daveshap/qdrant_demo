Trigger to SELECT schema rows based on WHERE condition I am learning about triggers.Generally it seems triggers are employed on the backend to perform some action on a schema. I was interested if it was possible for a trigger to return data on a SELECT statement to the main application.In the table I'm working with we have several string columns followed with a geom (geometry::polygon) column which would contain the WKBT LAT/LONG values.I'd like to return the rows which meet some WHERE clause AND also return the geom [LAT/LON] in WKBT format. By return I am interested in returning data to the main application.I seek any examples.Currently I build a list of all our column names {colA, colB, colC, colD} and then append the following as the last entry: public.ST_ASText(geom). So I obtain a SELECT as follows....SELECT colA, colB, colC colD, public.ST_AsText(geom) FROM schemaA WHERE .So the crux of the problem here I cannot use SELECT * since I must convert the geom (LAT/LON pairs) to WKBT and this must be in the select along with every other column name defined, whether I use that column data or not.  I definitely require the geom column in WKBT format. This is passed via our DEVART interface.I was wondering if there is a better way to do this,
