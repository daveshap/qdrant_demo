What effect, if any, has Trump's regulation strategy had on the increasing US emissions of 2018?
 I was doing some research on US progress on reducing emissions. From the ["Final US Emissions Estimates for 2018"](https://rhg.com/research/final-us-emissions-estimates-for-2018/) by Rhodium Group, 2018 saw a significant up-tick in US emissions from 2017 after 3 years of decrease. Increases were found in almost every sector: Transportation, Buildings, Power, Industry. Partial justifications for some of these increases include a colder winter--which offsets the energy savings of a cooler summer--and economic growth.

We've also seen [environmental regulations systematically removed](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/climate/trump-environment-rollbacks.html) by the Trump administration. What effect do some of these regulations changes have on our emissions if any? Consider both \[1: Increased economic growth via reduced regulative burden\] and \[2: Increased emissions due to less stringent regulation\]

In addition, I noticed a curious discrepancy between the Rhodium Group's report and the EPA's reports. The EPA website only [provides data up to 2017](https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/inventory-us-greenhouse-gas-emissions-and-sinks-1990-2017) and an [EPA news report](https://www.epa.gov/newsreleases/latest-inventory-us-greenhouse-gas-emissions-and-sinks-shows-long-term-reductions) published in April, 2019 similarly provides insights only up to 2017. Rhodium group published their [Preliminary US Emissions Estimates for 2018](https://rhg.com/research/preliminary-us-emissions-estimates-for-2018/) in January, 2019. In the Rhodium report, they cite data from other independent sources--Bloomberg and Genscape--and other government agencies--EIA (U.S. Energy Information Administration) and the US Department of Transportation. Notably, the [EIA has already started publishing preliminary reports for 2019](https://www.eia.gov/coal/production/quarterly/) and the [USDT has added data for 2018](https://www.bts.gov/topics/national-transportation-statistics) separately in each independent report throughout 2019.

It seems the Rhodium Group has published an analysis years earlier than a similar EPA report will be available. Why are they able to do this? Are there trade-offs in the scope or the quality of their analyses?
