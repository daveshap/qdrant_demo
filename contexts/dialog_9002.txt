KATE: I have a bad feeling about this.
JACK: About the plane? What do you think it’s gonna crash? Don’t say that...
KATE: I know we’ve talked about this a thousand times and we both agree that going to London is the right thing to do. But in my heart... this feels wrong.
KATE: Don’t go, Jack...
JACK: You mean don’t go at all? What about my internship?
KATE: Believe me I know what an incredible opportunity this is for you...
JACK: For us, Kate.
KATE: Right, for us. But...I’m afraid that if you get on that plane...
JACK: What?
KATE: Go. I’m sorry, you should just go...
JACK: No, you’re right. What are we doing?
KATE: We're being responsible. Go. Get on the plane.
