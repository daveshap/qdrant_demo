LAURA: Are you going to lie in that flower bed all night?
ROB: Uh... No.
LAURA: You're soaking.
ROB: Mmnn.
LAURA: You're also an idiot.
ROB: I can see why you say that. Look, I'm sorry. I really am. The last thing I wanted was... that's why I left, because... I lost it, and I didn't want to blow my top in there, and... look, the reason I fucked everything up was because I was scared. I just wanted you to know, that's all.
LAURA: Thank you. I appreciate it. I can't reciprocate.
ROB: What do you mean?
LAURA: I didn't mess things up because I was scared. I slept with Ray because I was sick of you. And I needed something to snap me out of it.
ROB: Sure, I understand. Look, I don't want to take up any more of your time. You get back, and I'll wait here for a bus.
LAURA: I don't want to go back.
ROB: What do you want to do?
LAURA: C'mon.
ROB: When are you going back?
LAURA: I don't know. Sometime. Later. Listen, Rob, would you have sex with me?
ROB: What?
LAURA: I want to feel something else than this. It's either that or I go home and put my hand in the fire. Unless you want to stub cigarettes out on my arm.
ROB: I've only got a couple left. I'm saving them for later.
LAURA: It'll have to be sex, then.
LAURA: Hello. It doesn't seem so long ago that I looked at you from here.
ROB: Hi.
LAURA: I knew there was a reason I wore a skirt today.
ROB: You know, with Ray...
LAURA: Oh, Rob, we're not going to go through that again.
ROB: No, no. It's not... are you still on the pill?
LAURA: Yes, of course. There's nothing to worry about.
ROB: I didn't mean that. I mean... was that all you used?
ROB: Look, we can do other things.
LAURA: I lived with you. You were my partner just a few weeks ago and now you're worried I might kill you, and you're entitled to worry. Isn't that a terrible thing? Isn't that sad?
