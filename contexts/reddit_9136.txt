Anyone feel like everyone else has more money than them?
I'm 30/M and a teacher (I can hear the jokes already). I live in an average, mid-sized city in the Midwest, come from a middle-class family. I've never been rich or anything, but I've definitely never struggled either

I'm 65K deep in student loans, and all I've got to show in my savings account is 2 grand. I feel like I look around and see everyone else getting married, buying a house, going on awesome vacations, etc, and I'm over here like "lmao I'll never be able to buy a house"

We've all seen news stories and heard about how millennials have no money, need to work multiple jobs, etc. And yet I don't get that impression from a lot of my peers at all. Yes, I have friends who graduated college, couldn't find an actual career and are now working part-time gigs, but I feel like I know more who are doing just fine

Money is the only thing I get self-conscious about, because it seems like everyone else has more than me and is doing well for themselves. And yes, I'm still improving myself in terms of budgeting and spending, I still feel like I'll never be able to do some of the things others are doing

Anyone else like this?
