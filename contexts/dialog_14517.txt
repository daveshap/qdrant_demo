QUINT: A marlin, or a stingray. Huh. Don't ever tell me my business again. Get back up on the bridge.
HOOPER: I'm okay...
QUINT: Fasten the pole.
BRODY: What's the point with hooks and Lines? --
QUINT: Don't tell me my business! Quarter-mile, that way. Full throttle.
BRODY: How -- if they're gonna keep on breaking?
QUINT: What I do is trick him to the surface, got that? Then I can jab him, understand? Think I'm gonna haul it in as if he's a catfish, like everyone else does?
QUINT: Over there!
HOOPER: What do you see?
QUINT: At least you handle the boat all right. Stop. Here... Cut the engine.
HOOPER: 20 feet, if it's an inch...
QUINT: 25 feet. And three tons of him there.
QUINT: I never saw one that big.
BRODY: What do we do? Get some help? Radio in?
