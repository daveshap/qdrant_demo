Just settled a $5,500 debt for $2,750!
It was a car loan, originally $10,000, that hasn't been paid in years. We were able to pretty much completely ignore it without any negative repercussions thanks to the Service Member Civil Relief Act, a protection my husband is about to lose in less than a month. So, we had to finally deal with it. 

Saved up $5,500 *beyond* our emergency fund. But just for the hell of it wanted to see if we could negotiate it. Which I read was possible, but difficult. I low-balled and my husband literally laughed at me when I said "We have about $2,500." he hit back with $2,750!! It was that easy. It was a 5 minute phone call. I was originally going to start my negotiation at $3-3.5k. Glad I didn't! They just wanted *HALF*! 

That extra $2,750 we get to keep is worth much more than the damage a "settled" will have on his credit, which is actually somehow quite good. Shout out to SCRA. I'm so happy right now. This happened Friday and I just got the offer in writing. Will be making the payment today!

Edit: Well apparently I have pissed some people off for celebrating the fact that I settled when it *seems* I *could* have paid the whole thing.  

I'm in this sub because I'm poor and I am trying to fix it. I'm celebrating that we will be able to afford rent, food, and basic necessities all of us have probably experienced going without, while we transition from two incomes to one. This was an agreement between us and the lender. We wouldn't have done this if we could afford to pay it **and still survive.** Hopefully that clears everything up.

Edit 2: Man yall are an interesting bunch. Thank you for the all the support from majority of you kind redditors! There is tons of information that I didn't know and I'm so glad I posted, I hope this helps someone else!
