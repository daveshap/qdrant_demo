MRS. BRADDOCK: Can I talk to you a minute?
BEN: Sure.
MRS. BRADDOCK: Benjamin? I'm going to ask you something but you don't have to tell me if you don't want.
BEN: What?
MRS. BRADDOCK: Well I'm going to ask you what you do when you go off at night.
BEN: When I go off?
MRS. BRADDOCK: You don't have to tell me if you don't want.
BEN: No, I do. I want to tell you.
BEN: I drive around.
MRS. BRADDOCK: What else?
BEN: Nothing else.
MRS. BRADDOCK: Well you don't drive around from midnight until noon the next day, Benjamin.
BEN: Oh, no.
MRS. BRADDOCK: Then what do you do? Do you meet someone?
BEN: Meet someone?
BEN: Why did you say that?
MRS. BRADDOCK: Well this is your business, Benjamin. If you --
BEN: No wait. Wait.
BEN: I don't meet anyone, mother, but why did you say that?
MRS. BRADDOCK: Benjamin, I'm not going to pry into your affairs, but I'd rather you didn't say anything at all than be dishonest. Goodnight, Benjamin.
BEN: Well, wait.
