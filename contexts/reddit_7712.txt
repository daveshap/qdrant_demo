Need advice (concerning lab responsibility)
Hey all!

&#x200B;

Okay so, I'm a part of two labs at the moment (2nd year grad student) and I help run health assessments in one of them. Let's call this the secondary lab. I'm also the data manager on that project and the project lead is also a 2nd year graduate student. Everybody else on the project, besides PI, are either close to graduating undergrad or post-bacc. Enter, let's call her Susie. She's also a part of both labs, however she's a post-bacc who is interning for 20 hours a week. We have similar meeting schedules because our primary lab has regular lab meetings, journal clubs, etc. I spend more time in the lab than 20/week, obviously, because we run on a 9-5 office schedule. And, I'm here later than that regularly, as well.

&#x200B;

Circumstance: We need to enter in our availability for next month's assessments and I noticed that Susie checked that she was unavailable in the time periods that I know we have our journal club, and also the time we have our trainee meeting.

Petty: Our Journal clubs are not structured enough where we need to block that time off. If one of us is busy, we can often move it to another time. Also, the assessments can be ended early, so the time period that may involve our trainee meeting, she should be free for also.

Problem: I would note that I'm available during these times, but seeing how little Susie has available since she's not declaring availability in our mutually available times, I have a secondary-lab specific problem. If I say I'm available, more than likely me and the project lead would have to put more groundwork into these assessments and we've been trying to pass those responsibilities on to interns as it takes a lot of time out of our schedules and not really theirs. One intern has a set schedule whether she's in the lab or not and Susie has more freedom with her schedule to make up 3 hours that she'll be gone doing assessments per week. However, I love this lab and my PI. I don't want to say that I'm not available because Susie did and have this affect how much work will be put onto the leader and my PI, because that's even less fair.

Advice: Am I just being bitchy/nosy or is this a valid concern? Susie has also been annoying tf out of me by non-stop talking and being non-stop ego-buffed by her advisor about a paper she's first authoring that she didn't write :/, but that's another reddit complaint post and I'm sure that annoyance has inspired this rant, as well. I'm positive that I can't let my lab down and say I'm unavailable. Do you think if I find a way to mention this within the group (not as a confrontation, more like "this day isn't great for me because of our trainee meeting, but we can cut the time off early" she'll get the hint via leadership? I certainly cannot afford to be gone multiple days a week for 3 hour periods at a time and the PI has an even more strict schedule, I know for sure this slowdown of data acquisition wouldn't be fair to her.

&#x200B;

TL;DR Should I call out an intern in my lab who's likely bullshitting about when she's free to help with our research project?

Update to those who helped: I followed advice to only put what I was comfortable with and also included "maybe" dates that Susie Cakes did not. We got the schedule and I have 8 days out of March to her 4 :/. Which isn't horrible. The lead on the project has 7 days and the other intern has 6. I'm leading, but  not by far, could be worse. Thanks again!
