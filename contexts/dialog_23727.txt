ST. LUC: Forsythe, Forsythe! What's wrong? What's happened?
FORSYTHE: A man... I think I recognized him... a man who lives here. He just... ...he just attacked me for no reason at all. I just opened the door... I was making supper for you, and he grabbed me, he tried to kiss me...
ST. LUC: Where is he now? Do you know?
FORSYTHE: I think I... I think I killed him. I stabbed him with something and he fell.
ST. LUC: Will you be OK now? I've got to go to your place to see if he's still there. I've got to see if it's... if it's what we both think it is.
FORSYTHE: Oh, no! You're not leaving me here all alone. I'm going with you.
