How does your U handle keys / lockouts?
I'm curious what other U's do!

**Context:** Private, 4yr, \~130 residential students in 4 buildings. 8 RA's, 2 FT Resident Directors live on site. It's also worth noting that our RDs are  hourly, so there is some gray area on asking them to be available for lockouts 24/7, by gray area I mean I'm not sure it's legal unless we pay them for all those hours :)

**Lockouts**: Right now, between RAs and RDs we generally handle students locked out or their room or building from 7am-midnight. Campus Safety has 24-hour staff so they handle 12am-7am. We have lockboxes in each building that house all the backup keys for each room, we have to access the RA office, get the proper key out of the lockbox and then return it. Neither RAs or RDs are allowed to have master or sub-master keys. 

I would prefer a world in which RDs have master keys (access all campus) and RA's have a sub-master for just their building. Then I'd like Campus Safety to issue all resident keys (so we don't have \~100+ keys in each of our lockboxes). This seems like it would be the normal practice but as it stands, Res Life (RDs) issue and attempt to keep track of all resident keys and their backups.

**Questions:**

Who issues and charges for lost keys at your U?

Who handles lockouts? and during what times?

What role does Campus Safety play in these categories?
