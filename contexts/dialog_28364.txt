BLACK MAN: The wallet. You gotta go after him. He's got all the money.
STRANGER: Don't worry, we got the wallet. What happened? He get ya with the knife?
BLACK MAN: Give it to me! Please. I gotta know it's all there!
STRANGER: You just sit tight, old man. We're gonna have to get you to a doctor. I'll call a cop.
BLACK MAN: No, no cops!
STRANGER: You wanted by the law or somethin'?
BLACK MAN: Naw, it's okay.
STRANGER: You're crazy carryin' that kinda money in this neighborhood. No wonder you got hit.
BLACK MAN: Thanks. I'm obliged to ya, but I gotta get goin'.
STRANGER: You ain't goin' nowhere on that leg.
BLACK MAN: I gotta! Look, I run some slots down in West Bend for a mob here. I got a little behind on my payoffs so they figure I been holdin' out on 'em. They gave me to 4:00 to come up with the cash. I don't get it there I'm dead.
STRANGER: It don't look good, gramps, it's ten of now.
BLACK MAN: I got a hundred bucks for you and your friend if you deliver the money for me.
STRANGER: I dunno. That little mug that got ya is mad enough at me already -- what if he's out there waitin' around a corner with some friends.
BLACK MAN: He won't know you're carryin' it. C'mon, you gotta help me out.
STRANGER: Sorry, pal. I'll fix you up, call you a doc, but I ain't gonna walk into a bunch of knives for ya.
BLACK MAN: How bout you? I'll give you the whole hundred!
STRANGER: What makes you think you can trust him? He didn't do shit.
