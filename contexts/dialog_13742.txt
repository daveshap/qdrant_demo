RYUJI: I can't. He didn't do anything. Thanks to you.
JOE: Why are you on to him?
RYUJI: We've had thefts of our new stuff ...GRUNER deals in this... A big deal is going down now. I went to see if GRUNER had anything to sell. But he didn't make any moves...And when you arrived, he backed off.
JOE: Why'd you invite me here?
RYUJI: Someone is selling. You followed us. If it's not him, it must be you. If it's not you, it must be him... You scared him off.
JOE: What about the others.
RYUJI: I don't know.
