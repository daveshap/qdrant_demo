If you make a "I got in !!" thread, and don't list the school or your stats, it should be deleted tbh.
Cause it's kinda pointless and attention whoring at that point.


EDIT: People can post their "I got ins", at the very least say where though, otherwise it's just a spam post cause it has no substance/ context.
