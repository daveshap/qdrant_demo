How do I deal with looked down on by friends and family?
This is my first time in this situation. I've given it a lot of thought to process my own observations.

I'm in my mid twenties and ever since I've lost my first career job. I have not been able to find a job. My total experience is just short of being acceptable. While I feel like ranting about what I have done and still can't find a  job and trust me I used to be don't give up optimistic type of person. But that's another story. I want to talk about how toxic people are around you EVEN if you have savings and supporting yourself somewhat.

- i saw jobs on indeed, did you apply to them. (as if finding job postings was a problem, did i not tell you i've been applying to 20 - 30 jobs a day) 

- go pick up garbage on street if you really can't find a job - family

- man you are not serious about the job - friend (whom i have talked to only 3 times in a year)

- all you have to do is take you resume and walk into any of those store. - neighbor (i did it didn't work, all said apply online) 

- you just dont wanna work (in one year i have had 20 interviews and applied to ~500 jobs no but that must be it) 

- im worried about your future why dont you try (wow... no words)

also i noticed people think it's ok to make you butt of a joke in every joke. i didn't know this was normal. personally job or no job i never looked at person like that. i always started conversations with what do you like vs as what i get now as i grow older it's always what do you do.

i also noticed people think it's ok to belittle you if you ever decide to have fun. going for a walk - yea just walk all day. play a game - grown unemployed men playing kids games. watching a documentary - what episode is this, 100?, did you get any interview today.
try to learn a skill - forget that just apply to jobs.

in short everyone close to you treats you progressively worse over time and your existence serves to only take garbage from all. from parents, to siblings, to friends, to neighbors, and even your barber. "oh you still didn't find a job, you live with your family smirk"... you're just a lazy mentally disturbed loser and bad influence on a society.

most days im ok, i dont mind having to walk instead of taking transportation. i dont mind never eating out. i dont mind not having 7 years old phone... many things... as i have hope that i only have to get a job and then i can buy whatever i need soon. but what gets me is toxic people. most days i ignore but then some day it all hits you once. 

just wanted to vent
