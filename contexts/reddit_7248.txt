Let's be real - most jobs are not that hard, so why don't companies train anymore?
Except for maybe fighter pilots, astronauts, F100 CEOs, and ER docs the vast majority of jobs are really not that hard and most people can do a good job if trained. (Except F100 CEOS all those mentioned happen to have intense training too)

So why don't companies train workers? I spoke with a friend who works in HR and he claimed that it's too expensive to train employees. (I didn't mention that just last month he was complaining about how they can't find anyone to fill their openings!)

In reality it seems like leaving a job open and as a result work unfinished and companies understaffed/inefficient is way more costly to a business than training someone.

What do you all think? Should companies train employees? Is HR just populated by fools unable to properly perform their tasks?
