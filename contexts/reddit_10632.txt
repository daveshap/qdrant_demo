I want to reach out to someone, anyone but I feel so detached.
I’m hurting so much and I can’t do it anymore. I know I’ve posted before and I’m sorry if I’m vague. I don’t even have words to get the emotions out. I am only 21 but it’s so clear to me now that I ruin everything in my life. I know people love me, but I know I’m not a good person. I know I feel this way because of my own actions and I know I can’t ever fix or make up for things I have done. I don’t see the point in my life anymore. I don’t want to do anything. Nothing makes me feel better. I just want it to stop and I always end up hurting myself again. I know I need to seek help, but I just don’t see a point anymore. I haven’t slept in 2 days and I think I’m done being scared. I’m just done, I hope God is real. I hope He forgives me. I just want everything to stop. I want to say please help me but it doesn’t matter anyways. I’m sorry.

EDIT: you’re all such amazing people, I’ve cried so much reading these comments. Complete strangers who care more than people right next to me is crazy to me. I am still depressed, I am still hurting but I am still here. Thank you so much. I love you all even tho we don’t know each other. I wish I had better words.
