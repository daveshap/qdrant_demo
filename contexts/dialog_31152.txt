RAY: How soon can we get something?
DAVE: We can get blood type right away. Dental records will take longer. You want DNA, that can take weeks.
RAY: Poor dumb Suzie, she never had a chance.
GLORIA: We don't know that, Ray...
RAY: Kelly's next, Gloria.
HUNTER: Get off this Ray, now. If there is any evidence here, it's for Homicide. You get an ID, you call me.
RAY: Will you do me one favor?
GLORIA: Ray, you heard him...
RAY: What if I'm right, Gloria? What if I'm right and Hunter's wrong? What do you do if you see a bad thing coming?
RAY: Stick with me on this Gloria. I need you...
GLORIA: And if the teeth aren't Suzie's? You'll give this up?
RAY: If I'm wrong about those teeth -- it's a promise.
DAVE: Merritt, Forensics.
RAY: The teeth doin' any talkin'?
DAVE: Ray. Stop calling. I told you the dental records will take time...
RAY: What about the blood?
DAVE: Could be hers. Types match. Could be a lot of other people's too...
RAY: Second you get something on those teeth, I want it
KELLY: Hello?
SAM: Hello.
KELLY: God, I've been calling you.
KELLY: I'm really serious. That cop, he keeps watching me.
SAM: Duquette. Forget him...
KELLY: I can't help it. He gives me the creeps... I mean why was Suzie so scared of him? She's not that way. I think he did something...
SAM: Yeah, he got her busted for possession...
KELLY: I don't know... I think it was something else... Suzie says the bust was bullshit...
SAM: And you believe her?
KELLY: I don't know. I want to see you...
SAM: Kelly... Relax. Take one of your mom's valium or something. In another week you get on the plane. It's over. We're rich.
KELLY: But what if they find out... God, they'd put you in the gas chamber...
SAM: So if they're tapping your phone, we're dead. Stay in the guest house. Skip the graduation parties. You'll never see Duquette. Okay? I love you.
KELLY: Okay. I love you too.
SAM: Isn't that against the law, peeking into windows?
GLORIA: Suzie Toller is missing.
SAM: How long?
GLORIA: She didn't cone home last night. We found her car at the bus terminal, but nothing to suggest she bought a ticket.
SAM: Maybe she used another name.
GLORIA: Ray thinks she was murdered.
SAM: I don't know what to say...
GLORIA: You could tell me where you were last night.
