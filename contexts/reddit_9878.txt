Question from an interview and my gender.
Hi everyone!

Question for the group:

I had a great pre-phone interview a few days ago for an FSL opportunity.  The hiring manager asked a question that was a concern from the students that I would be potentially working with and I would like to run it by you all for advice/help/views.  The female students are wanted to have a female in the position after the previous three professionals were male.  The hiring manager asked how I would address this need from the women in the community.  I responded by affirming the need for representation in a professional setting, as a male identifying individual am enthusiastic about their organizations and the awesome work they are doing and how they are leading the fraternal community.  That communicating my passion and ability to serve their organizations would be crucial and it would start with establishing a strong relationship with the leaders of each organization and the leadership of the community.  

Would you all have any thoughts, ideas, concerns about my answer or better ways to address this situation?
