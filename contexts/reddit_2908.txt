My boss said I’m too smart for my job. Does that mean I’m going to get fired?
I started a new job 2 weeks ago at a very small company with four employees. On Friday, my boss (the owner of the business) pulled me into her office and asked if I was happy there and elaborated that she thinks I’m too smart for this job. I’m really worried this means I’m going to be fired because I’m being cross trained to do every role in the business so there isn’t any additional responsibilities she could give me. What do you make of this?

Edit: Truly, thank you for all the advice. It’s been making me think about some things. One thing I’d like to clear up is that I graduated with a useless BA from a liberal arts college and that I quit my last job that I had more responsibilities at without having anything else lined up. So I definitely think that I’m lucky to have found this position because I wasn’t getting offers anywhere else.
