RICK: It was a combination of all three.
RENAULT: And what in heaven's name brought you to Casablanca?
RICK: My health. I came to Casablanca for the waters.
RENAULT: Waters? What waters? We're in the desert.
RICK: I was misinformed.
RENAULT: Huh!
EMIL: Excuse me, Monsieur Rick, but a gentleman inside has won twenty thousand francs. The cashier would like some money.
RICK: Well, I'll get it from the safe.
EMIL: I am so upset, Monsieur Rick. You know I can't understand --
RICK: -- Forget it, Emil. Mistakes like that happen all the time.
EMIL: I'm awfully sorry.
RENAULT: Rick, there's going to be some excitement here tonight. We are going to make an arrest in your cafe.
RICK: What, again?
RENAULT: This is no ordinary arrest. A murderer, no less.
RENAULT: If you are thinking of warning him, don't put yourself out. He cannot possibly escape.
RICK: I stick my neck out for nobody.
RENAULT: A wise foreign policy.
RENAULT: You know, Rick, we could have made this arrest earlier in the evening at the Blue Parrot, but out of my high regard for you we are staging it here. It will amuse your customers.
RICK: Our entertainment is enough.
