DR. GARDNER: How is the date night" idea going over with Eve?"
ARCHER: Like gangbusters, doc. Okay, I missed the last one.
DR. GARDNER: You missed the last three, including her birthday. Your wife's gripe sheet.
ARCHER: I've been working night and day. I haven't had time.
DR. GARDNER: You're supposed to make time. When was the last time you told her you love her? When was the last time you two had sex?
ARCHER: One of my informants spotted him -- right here in the city.
DR. GARDNER: I just asked you about making love to your wife, and you started talking about your job.
ARCHER: I'm not hiding in my work, if that's what you're saying.
DR. GARDNER: You said it, Jon, not me.
