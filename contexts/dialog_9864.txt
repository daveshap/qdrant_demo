HARRY: Momma told ya not to speak to strangers, huh? Hey!
FRANCES: Don't touch me.
HARRY: I'm not gonna hurt you. I just wanna talk.
FRANCES: Okay then...
HARRY: Well... you're causin' trouble, you know that?
FRANCES: I'm causing trouble?! You're a pain in the butt! You newshounds've been after me and my folks ever since I won that dumb contest. I'm just sixteen, you know? Who the hell cares what I think?
HARRY: Not me. But other people seem to.
FRANCES: Yeah. Well if you didn't put it in the papers -- nobody'd even know about it.
HARRY: Now wait a minute, sweetie. Do I look like a newshound to you?
FRANCES: No... Actually, you look more like a cop.
