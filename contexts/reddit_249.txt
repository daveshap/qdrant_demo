please help
i’m from england and i’m going to college or sixth form in September this year, i’m really stressed about my GCSEs and even more stressed about what i’m going to do after i finish secondary school.
i’ve applied to four places so far (because many places have passed their application deadline). i’ve lost a lot of hope and happiness for my future because my dad and my friends tell me that i can’t go anywhere with art.
i’ve chosen art because i’m debatable good at it but i kinda don’t want to do it, but everything seems so difficult, i’ve applied for BTECs in 3 different colleges and only A levels in the one connecting to my school. 
i’ve also applied for a BTEC for criminology because i find interest in becoming a social worker or even a police officer, my parents dislike that more because they feel like those careers would put me at risk and i feel like i can’t do anything without judgement. 
i’m also extremely stressed about meeting new people, i have chosen colleges that are extremely far from my secondary school (in the other direction but close to my house) and none of my friends are going to any of them. i’m afraid that i won’t have any friends when i go and that i’ll lose contact with the ones i have already. i am slightly afraid of people and basically everything, i just feel like my mental health is going to get worse next year because i feel like i’m going to regret my decisions.
