GLORIA: So what about the girls? Suzie's poor, but why would Kelly have to steal from her own mother? Surely her father...
RAY: Her father didn't leave her squat. The kid's got money in trust from her grandfather, but she can't touch that till her mother dies and Sandra seems to have the idea that Kelly ought to learn the value of a buck.
GLORIA: This one's got you working overtime, hasn't it?
RAY: I flat don't like the guy, Glory. He's dirty. And I'll tell you something else. You want to know how old man Lombardo lost his money? He was fucked out of it by old man Van Ryan, on a little item known as the Salt Creek Land Deal. It was after the war. Van Ryan set up a corporation to develop swamp land, got investors like Lombardo to put up money, then turned around and got the state to declare the area an ecological preserve, on the sly, of course, but everyone knew it was him. The freeway went to the coast, right where Van Ryan wanted it.
GLORIA: Eliminate the competition.
RAY: You got it. The rich got richer. While the saps like Lombardo went belly-up in the swamp.
GLORIA: Where'd you come up with this stuff, anyway?
RAY: I net a guy in a bar.
