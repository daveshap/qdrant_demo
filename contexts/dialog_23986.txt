VIKTOR: Can't you stop that?
LAINEY: Why?
VIKTOR: Those things can be dangerous. Staring at a screen all day -- you miss what's going on outside in the real world. You can lose yourself. You should get out more. How are you going to meet boys?
LAINEY: I know plenty of boys.
VIKTOR: Really? Who? Where do you meet them? In a chat room? How do you know he's not some middle-aged freak?
LAINEY: Dad, I can spot a middle-aged freak a mile away.
VIKTOR: Okay. But you have to find a way to escape that thing.
LAINEY: I do.
VIKTOR: How?
LAINEY: I read.
VIKTOR: You do? Still? I can't tell you how happy I am to hear that.
LAINEY: You were the one who insisted on it. Reading me Dostoyevsky and Joyce when I was four.
VIKTOR: You understood them. That's what was amazing. It's a nice day. Let's eat outside.
