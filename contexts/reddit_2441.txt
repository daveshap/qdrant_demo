My father has been a carpenter for close to 45 years. He had an accident losing fingers yesterday and doesn’t know what to do. Any suggestions are greatly appreciated?
My father is 58 and in great health and physical condition. He had an accident a few days ago losing the middle 3 fingers on his left hand. I know he’s scared in the present but he’s also terrified of the future now. I think he’s probably unsure of how the bills are going to get paid or how life is going to be changed. As long as I’ve been alive he has been able to fix anything and do anything using his hands and brain. Any ideas as to what someone with his skills but new possible limitations can do?
