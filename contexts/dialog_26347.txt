ZALTAR: Takes a long time, you know, learning the wand. Just begun to understand it myse1f. Give things a kind of life--can also take away life; works backwards too. Besides I can't let you take my wand. Only have the one, what would I do? I'd be helpless. It's out of the question.
SUPERGIRL: Then come with me.
ZALTAR: Leave the zone? What would I do on Earth?
SUPERGIRL: You could do anything. You could sculpt mountain ranges...draw with rainbows! You'd have superpowers.
ZALTAR: Superpowers. Got you in a lot of trouble, didn't they?
SUPERGIRL: Please. I have to get back to Earth. My friends are in trouble. And unless I bring back the Power Source, Argo City will die.
