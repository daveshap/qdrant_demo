RAYMOND: I would like to thank you for your hospitality. If you are ever in Paris here is my number.
WAYNE: Cool.
DANIEL: I'll be right back. He gets out of the car and walks over to him.
LAMAR: What do you want now?
DANIEL: Guns. Can you get them?
LAMAR: Man, I can get anything.
DANIEL: Don't bullshit me.
LAMAR: I ain't bullshittin'. I can get guns. I can get any kind of gun you want. But they ain't gonna help your sorry ass. You ain't been in town one day and already you got two of the toughest people in Chicago looking for you. How is that possible?
DANIEL: I've got a way with people.
LAMAR: I can see that. The man's car you stole. Raphael Ruiz. He's head of the 19th Street gang and one crazy motherfucker. And Frankie Zammito's got the word out he's looking for some French dudes. You're French ain't ya?
DANIEL: I'm from Belgium.
LAMAR: Yeah, I'd be from Belgium too if I was you. You know Zammito just put his own brother in the hospital? Broke his arm cause he was late on a debt. I mention this to illustrate the kind of people who are lookin' for you.
DANIEL: Why haven't you turned us in?
LAMAR: I ain't no rat. You got money, right?
LAMAR: And, uh, I'm going to have to charge you a commission... kind of like a brokerage fee.
DANIEL: How much?
LAMAR: A thousand dollars?
DANIEL: Fine.
