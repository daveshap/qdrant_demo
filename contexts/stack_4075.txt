Does 72 hour transportation pass for zones P 0 B in Prague get you to the airport? I bought a 3 day pass in Prague. On the back it says it's valid for zones P, 0, B. I have no idea where these zones are. On the internet, someone said it covers beyond the airport. But that doesn't mean transportation to the airport is covered. So is it? Can I get on the bus to the airport with this pass?
