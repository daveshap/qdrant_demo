Can’t talk to people.
I can’t talk to people. What do I do?!

It’s a dumb question I know but I want to know. All my life I have been in one school and made friends there. Like childhood friends. Then I decided to go to another school for two years.  It’s about to come to an end now and I’ve made good friends. Like a group. But I can’t talk To anybody outside this group. I mean when someone tries to talk to me I can’t seem to keep up a conversation. I just end up saying something that’s perfect to end a conversation and I really want to be social. I want to have a close friendship. Even with my childhood friends I feel like a third wheel. Like they’re talking about something that I know nothing about and I just smile awkwardly to seem okay. Why am I not able to talk to people in general? I have this perfect conversation in my head and either it goes nothing like it or it never happens cause I couldn’t make a move. I mean I’m probably going abroad for studies in 6 months or so and I keep on believing that I’ll be a social butterfly there. I won’t. How could I when I can’t get myself to talk to people in my own country! Well thanks for reading.
