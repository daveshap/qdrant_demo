My girlfriend of 4 years has left me because she no longer loves me
I’ve been with this girl for 4 years, we were so deeply in love, we have travelled to 5 different countries together and always been there for each other. 

We have never had many friends but we always had each other. 

And recently she was very distant and I finally pulled it out of her - she doesn’t love me anymore (mainly because we have little in common - something that has never bothered me) and wants to move on. 

This fucking SUCKS. I am absolutely heart broken. It sound so cringy but she is literally my best fucking friend and I love her more than anything in this entire world. 

My whole world is shattered
