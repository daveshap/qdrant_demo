How to stop a job for the rest of the day after the relevant condition has been satisfied once? I have a job that runs every 5 minutes to check an IF condition. If the condition is true, it will send an email, if not, it won\u2019t do anything. My problem is that once the IF condition is true, it will remain true for the whole day and, as the job is running after every 5 minutes, it will keep sending the email after every 5 minutes. I need to stop the job for the whole day once the email has been sent once. Is there a way to do so?
