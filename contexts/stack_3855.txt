Should I learn R for a project? I am in charge of an academic research project, building predictive models based on clinical data from multiple longitudinal cohorts of diseased patients. The total number of patients and controls (over all cohorts) is about 1500. Each patient has multiple visits. In total there are around 100-400 items for each patient. I have 8-15 months to complete the project.I have no experience with statistics or R. I have a PhD in another area of applied math and know Matlab. The question: is this a good opportunity to learn R? Will learning R help me get through this project or will it be a source of frustration?Some considerations:I know I will enjoy learning R  It's a skill that may/may not benefit me in the futureIt does not matter what I leave behind in terms of code etcThe output of the project is a publicationIt is fine if progress is slow to begin with
