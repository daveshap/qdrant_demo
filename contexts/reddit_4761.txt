I’m drowning and I don’t know what to do
Sometimes I think that maybe I don’t really know what I want. I hate it. I hate how I look at other people and hate them. I hate when they smile, I hate when they laugh I hate how fucking happy everyone else is. I’m being left behind. I know I am, everyone is so far ahead of me and I’m drowning in my own damn mind.

 I can’t keep this up. I can’t keep smiling and pretending I’m cool with being the lonely asshole who stays in her room all day. Who only goes outside to go to class or to get some unhealthy shit that she’ll feel bad about ten minutes later. I don’t think I want to die. I just... I want to be free. But maybe freedom is death for me. 

I want to hit something. I want to yell and scream but at the same time I just want someone to hug me and tell me that it’s okay and that I matter. But that won’t happen. Not in a way that’s genuine and real, it’s all fucking pretend to make people feel better and act like they actually care for the small lonely bitch who tries too hard to not care at all. 

If I’m alone then maybe it’s better for me to leave anyway, fully embrace it instead of begging for some kind of helping hand. No one would really care if I go. I give them three months tops until I just become a distant name they remember every so often. Everything is so loud but painfully silent at the same time why can’t it stop I want everything to just fucking stop. 

I tried to get help last year but they just pretended to care about me to. They read straight off a damn script. Didn’t take long for me to figure out the pattern and say what I needed to get out. I don’t know what to do anymore. I feel like this my final chance to ask for help before I go back into a hole I may not be able to escape from again. I don’t trust anyone and those few that I do hole a level of trust for I don’t want to burden them so I smile and play it off as some edgy joke. I need help but I don’t even know where to start.
