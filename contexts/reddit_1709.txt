I will DO 3 MILES FOR EACH IVY I GET INTO I WILL LIVESTREAM IT
guys I will do this once I actually get a 100 upvotes because god I donâ€™t want to run miles ðŸ˜¢

Edit: I will be doing a total of 50 miles each ivy I get into and I will be getting it done before the end of April !!!!!!!!

I will be live streaming each day depending on how many miles each day and will keep you all updated

Edit edit: I JUST REACHED 100 but IM READY TO DO THIS SHIT WOOHOOO

Edit Edit EDIT: Due to people PMing about the safety of running the miles I will do them as soon as quarantines are over to ensure the safety of many people, BUT WORRY NOT I WILL BE DOING THEM IF I GET ACCEPTEDðŸ˜¤

I got a full sweep of rejections ðŸ¥º
