FOLEY: What did you call me, Mayo?
SID: Zack, don't!
ZACK: I thought the D.I.'s were supposed to help you in this place! What kind of human being are you?
FOLEY: Stop eyeballing me, Mayo, or you're out!
SID: Please, Zack -- go back to the barracks!
ZACK: I don't get it! He's the best candidate in our class! Ask anyone! The best student! The best leader! The best friend to everybody! Couldn't you bend your goddamn standards just a little?
SID: Zack, it wasn't him! He didn't ask me to D.O.R. I came to him on my own. I'm glad it's over, Zack. I really mean that. He was right. I wasn't doing this for me.
