BRENNA: I can't figure out why he's doing it. He's been Richard Taupin at least since 1967. And the guys rich. You should see the stuff he has in that shop.
DENNIS: Maybe he's hiding from something.
BRENNA: Some guy named Smith was asking about him in Church Hill. I passed his name around with your buddies downtown but they drew a blank. So he isn't a cop. District anyway.
DENNIS: Probably just some exec ducking an ex-wife.
BRENNA: Dr. Kidell had a picture in his file of the funeral. The father looked just like Richard. Even had a mark on his cheek.
DENNIS: How old is Richard?
BRENNA: P.D. says 41, but he barely looks 30.
DENNIS: Find the father. That should clear things up.
DENNIS: Taupin, isn't that the guy Moran picked up the other night?
BRENNA: Yeah.
DENNIS: He'd want to know about all this.
BRENNA: Mr. Congeniality? Let him find his own clues. There's a journal article in this somewhere.
DENNIS: Uncle Joey's little girl. Can't get the taste out of her mouth.
DENNIS: Well, the cream of society awaits. If you're ever in the neighborhood...
BRENNA: Sure.
