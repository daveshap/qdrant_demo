SAMI: Why?
SOPHIE: Vincent Bastaldi is in jail.
DANIEL: For what?
SOPHIE: Laurant and Vincent were in business with Zammito.
DANIEL: What kind of business?
SOPHIE: Black market art. Zammito got to a few key security guards at the Metropolitan Museum. The Bastaldi's supplied the artists to make copies of famous works. They'd switch the paintings, send the originals to Paris and the Bastaldi's would sell them to private collectors.
AGENT HADLEY: We're talking Matisse, Renoir, Monet. We know for sure they replaced Van Gogh's Vase with twelve sunflowers" last week with a copy. It was on loan from the London National Gallery and they're not going to be very happy when they find out about it."
SAMI: So Bastaldi makes a deal with the Feds to trade up for his brother?
AGENT HADLEY: Yeah. He delivers the goods on Zammito. If we got what we wanted we'd let his brother go providing he tells us where the Van Gogh and the other paintings are.
RAYMOND: No one has mentioned the part of the plan about us getting caught and going to prison.
DANIEL: We're leaving. Raymond get the bag.
