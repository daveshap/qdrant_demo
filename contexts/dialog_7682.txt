MOTHER SISTER: That was a foolish act, but it was brave. That chile owes you his life.
DA MAYOR: I wasn't trying to be a hero. I saw what was about to happen and I reacted, didn't even think. If I did, I might not have done it in second thought. Da Mayor is an old man, haven't run that fast in years.
DA MAYOR: I went from first to home on a bunt single, scored the winning run, the bottom of the ninth, two out, August 1, 1939, Snow Hill, Alabama. Maybe I should be heroic more often.
MOTHER SISTER: Maybe you shouldn't. Don't get happy. This changes nothing between you and me. You did a good thing and Mother Sister wanted to thank you for it.
DA MAYOR: I thank you.
MOTHER SISTER: You're welcome.
MOOKIE: Sal, I don't care if you fire me this exact minute, leave my sister alone.
SAL: Mookie, I don't know what you're talking about, plus I don't want to hear it.
MOOKIE: Sal, just do me a favor, leave Jade alone.
SAL: Here, you gotta delivery.
