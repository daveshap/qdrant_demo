What are the legal avenues for immigration to the United States, and what about the process or policy discourages undocumented immigrants from pursuing these legal options?
The “why don’t they come here legally” argument, but in earnest. Why *don’t* they? 

Jeff Sessions recently said, of those illegally crossing the border from Mexico, 
>[Our goal is that immigrants should apply, wait their turn, and that people stop making that dangerous trek across the desert rather than coming here unlawfully.](https://www.justice.gov/opa/speech/attorney-general-sessions-addresses-recent-criticisms-zero-tolerance-church-leaders) 

What specifically does "waiting their turn" consist of? Are there limitations that keep prospective immigrants from applying legally?What aspects of U.S. Immigration policy dissuade people from immigrating legally?

If the hardships of living in the United States illegally [are so great](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5129489/) what are the corresponding hardships of legal immigration that drive many to choose the illegal alternative?

Some background

- [Coming to a border checkpoint and claiming asylum is legal,] (https://www.pri.org/stories/2018-05-01/how-does-seeking-asylum-work-us-border) but [Jeff Sessions' recent rulings alter what qualifies for asylum.](https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2018/06/12/us/ap-us-immigration-asylum.html)

- [Illegal border crossing poses many dangers](http://aldianews.com/articles/politics/immigration/high-temperatures-getting-lost-are-main-dangers-along-us-mexico-border), but [people do it anyway](https://www.voanews.com/a/migrants-continue-to-risk-lives-crossing-us-border-from-mexico/3433293.html).

- [Estimates are that about 1 million people immigrate legally to the US annually](http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2012/jun/20/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-says-us-admits-1-million-immigrants-ye/), but I cannot find any annual estimates for illegal immigrants (crossings + overstays)

- [Most undocumented residents living in the United States illegally did not cross a border illegally, but overstayed visas.] (http://cmsny.org/publications/jmhs-visa-overstays-border-wall/)
