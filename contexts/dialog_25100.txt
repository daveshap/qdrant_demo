HOFFY: Ready?
BLONDIE: Roger.
HOFFY: Okay. Move on.
PRICE: I don't know what your scheme is, but it sounds crazy.
HOFFY: Maybe it's crazy, but it's better than having Dunbar dead.
PRICE: Just as you say, Hoffy. But wouldn't it be smarter if I went out and kept Schulz tied up?
HOFFY: Good.
SEFTON: I wouldn't worry about Schulz. I'd worry about Sefton. Remember me? I'm the stoolie.
DUKE: You ain't going to squeal this one, brother.
SEFTON: No? Aren't you a little afraid to turn the stoolie loose on that compound? For a tip-off like this, you know what the Krauts would pay?
HOFFY: You'll stay in this barracks and not a peep out of you.
SEFTON: Okay, then. Put a guard on me. I want you to put a guard on me. Because if anything goes wrong out there, this time you won't have a patsy. Right?
HOFFY: Right.
SEFTON: So who stays with me? Maybe Joey? No -- not Joey. Wouldn't you feel safer with Security on the job?
HOFFY: Okay, Price. You stay.
PRICE: What about Schulz?
HOFFY: We'll take care of Schulz. Come on.
