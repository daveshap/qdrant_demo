Are there any construction jobs, or well paying jobs that have schedules flexible that i can go to college 2 days of the week not including weekends?
Right now i really want to go into construction. It's what my dad does, and a few uncle's do as well. It pays good too, but i do also want to finish college and get a degree in business. I have worked full-time and been a full-time student before when i was working in a pizza place going to school all day on Tuesdays and Thursdays, but it payed really bad, I'm not looking for some crazy $30/hr place either, but the hours i get the better.
