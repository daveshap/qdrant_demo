POWELL: How do you know?
MCCLANE: I've seen enough phoney ID's in my time to recognize that the ones they've got cost a fortune. Add all that up and I don't know what the fuck it means, but these are bad ass preps and they're here to stay.
POWELL: I hear you... Partner. And LA's finest are on it, so light 'em if you got 'em.
MCCLANE: I'm ahead of you...partner.
POWELL: Uh, what do I call you?
MCCLANE: 'Roy'.
POWELL: Got it...'Roy'. Now listen. If you think of anything else you think we need to know, don't be shy, okay? In the meantime I want you to find a safe place and hole-up and let us do our job. Understand?
MCCLANE: They're all yours, Al. Good luck.
