JACK: I tell you something, Anne. I really feel like I'm cursed.
ANNE: Oh stop. Things will change. My Aunt Mary always said, there's a remedy for everything in this world except death and having no class.
JACK: I get this feeling like I'm... a magnet but I attract shit. Out of all the people in this city, why did I meet a man who's wife I killed?
ANNE: You didn't kill anybody. Stop.
JACK: I wish there was some way I could... just... pay the fine and go home.
