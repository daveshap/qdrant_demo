ELLE: Thank you!
PAULETTE: And after they set his nose, he came back for his truck and I offered to drive for him since he was still on pain-killers and we spent the whole afternoon together! He was unconscious for part of it, but it was really fun!
ELLE: I'm so happy for you!
PAULETTE: How'd it go at the trial?
ELLE: Great. Donovan actually said the words Good work
PAULETTE: Of course I can believe it. You're going to make a great lawyer.
