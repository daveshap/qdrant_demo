Origin of ending a sentence with a preposition-German separable verbs? One thing I've noticed about the usage of ending a sentence with a preposition is how similar the construction is to German separable verbs.  With German separable verbs, the prefix is often a preposition when taken by itself, such as \"mit-kommen\" = accompany, but is \"come with\" if it's broken into parts.  In a regular declarative sentence in German, this would be written with the prefix at the end, such as \"Paul kommt Erich mit\" = \"Paul accompanies Erick.\"My question is, aside from the parallel, is there an actual causal relationship here?  Is the common usage of putting a preposition at the end come from an old German construction with separable verbs?
