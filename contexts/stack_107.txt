Merging PDF files Together I\u2019m looking for a workaround to not buy Adobe Acrobat since this is the only time that I had needed it since using a computer for the last 20 years and I need to do just this 1 job with it.I\u2019m trying to use Preview viewer to merge pdf files together and I was successful at doing it just a minute ago yet can\u2019t seem to replicate my steps again. I open 2 pdf files in 2 separate Preview viewers (one being an older version) then drag a page from one sidebar into the next sidebar to correlate my multiple pdf file.But the Save and Save All option is grayed out and the Save option is only allowed in the drop down submenu under File. It would be nice if they weren\u2019t :/ But I have seen a Save All option button when I try to close the Preview viewer and this document looks like it\u2019s saved somewhere but never says to where and I can\u2019t find the file name under the Search bar option.Does anyone here know a work around on how I can do this please? Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated thank you very much.
