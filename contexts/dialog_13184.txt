WILL: The rain is letting up.
SEAMUS: Yes it is. Will and Seamus look at each other -
WILL: I don't know what happened... and I don't know what you did...
SEAMUS: I didn't do anything...God saved her...
WILL: What's going to happen?
SEAMUS: I wish I had an answer. Evil is powerful, more so every day it seems. But I believe the worst for you and for this house is behind us.
