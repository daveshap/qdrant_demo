EDDIE: Holy shit, this guy's all fucked up!
MR. WHITE: No shit, he's gonna fuckin' die on us if we don't get him taken care of.
MR. PINK: We were set up, the cops were waiting for us.
EDDIE: What? Nobody set anybody up.
MR. PINK: The cops were there waitin' for us!
EDDIE: Bullshit.
MR. PINK: Hey, fuck you man, you weren't there, we were. And I'm tellin' ya, the cops had that store staked out.
EDDIE: Okay, Mr. Detective, who did it?
MR. PINK: What the fuck d'you think we've been askin' each other?
EDDIE: And what are your answers? Was it me? You think I set you up?
MR. PINK: I don't know, but somebody did.
EDDIE: Nobody did. You assholes turn the jewelry store into a wild west show, and you wonder why cops show up.
