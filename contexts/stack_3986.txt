Does this forecast of a time-series makes sense? First of all, I don't know how to properly name the problem I am having and maybe is a naive question. I will illustrate it with an example, sorry about that.I want to optimize the air condition system of a home. The air condition system has two bottoms to set the minimum and the maximum temperature, so we can set the system to be between a rage of say 18-28\u00baC. What I mean by optimizing the system, is that I want to find out the best values to set the air condition so the temperature in the living room is always set to 21\u00baC. To do so, I have a lot of data about inside temperature, outside temperature, how many people is in the living room (as it would be more difficult to keep the temperature cool in summer), how many time the frontal door is open...As I am using temperatures and the air condition system does not change the temperature automatically, I have thought that time series modeling could be a good idea to solved this problem. I was thinking of considering all the variables like the outside temperature, the people in the living room and the time the frontal door is open as exogeneous series. Can I predict at what temperature should I set the minimum and maximum of the air conditioning? If so, how could I do that? I am having troubles to see if that makes sense as I am trying to set the temperature in the living room to 21\u00baC by just setting the air condition system, and there's no way I can predict the temperature that there will be, or is there a way?To me, what makes more sense is given a pair of minimum and maximum temperature try to predict the temperature that will be in the living room. The disadvantage of this approach is that I would need to compute the predictions for all the combinations of minimum and maximum temperatures of the air condition. Does this makes more sense?
