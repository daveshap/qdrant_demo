Being together a long time doesn't mean it's a good relationship
If you are ever in the position where you are thinking about ending a long term relationship, if the only thing making you stay is the amount of time you've been together, that one factor isn't worth staying. Now, if you want to try and work it out, by all means do so. But don't feel like you have to sacrifice or compromise your feelings for someone you have been with for awhile. It's never too late to start over and find that special person. Who knows, someone new could make you feel in six months how someone else made you feel in ten years. So if you're reading this and you feel like ending a long-term relationship would make all that time a waste, or would make you look stupid for staying so long, or for any other reason, it's ok. Not everything works out. That's life. It isn't anyone's fault. Just have the strength to follow your heart and if it tells you to move on, start looking for someone new. You can do that! I believe in you!
