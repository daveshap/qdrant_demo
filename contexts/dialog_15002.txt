JUNO: What?
MARK: I actually know this one.
JUNO: You do?
MARK: Yeah, this song's older than me, if you can believe that. I danced to it at my senior prom.
JUNO: That's almost interesting, Mark. Who did you dance with?
MARK: Her name was Cynthia Vogel and she was a good dance partner. Even let me put my hands on her butt.
JUNO: Oh man, I can just picture you slow dancing like a dork!
