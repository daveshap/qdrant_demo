Physical manifold with a natural linear connection on them Of course in many situation a manifold raised from a physical situation (like spacetime or configuration manifold and so on) are really much more richer than an abstract manifold. for example phase space is a symplectic manifold in a natural way.I want (all main) examples of manifolds which have naturally a linear connection on them. (one example is given on page 247 of the book GRAVITATION by Wheeler and others: spacetime. and as I want they explain how Equivalence Principe produce this conncetion)(may be examples will determine I would tag this question to what branches)
