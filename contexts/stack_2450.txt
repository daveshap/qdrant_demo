Looping Projection in ArcGIS ModelBuilder? I've got a global DEM raster dataset in WGS84 and need to project this to all WGS84 UTM Zones. So after that I should have 120 raster, one in each Zone.Is there a possibility to automate this process with the ArcMap ModelBuilder?I tried the \"for\" iterator, but I can't choose the epsg as iterating value.Then I need to run the flow length tool on all those rasters and then reproject the resulting 120 flow length rasters again into WGS84.Do you have any idea for an efficient way to create a ModelBuilder path for that?
