Jurisdictions in the USA vary in requirements for carrying a gun in public and desire of individuals to do so. Is there high quality research on the effects of people legally carrying guns in public on rates of violent crime, public negligent discharge, and/or any other relevant outcome?
[There is wide variance in gun laws within the USA](https://www.theguardian.com/world/us-news-blog/2013/jan/16/gun-laws-need-to-know), which creates the potential for [natural experiments](https://www.britannica.com/science/natural-experiment). However, gun deaths, the most widely discussed outcome, are no exception to the phrase "lies, damned lies, and statistics," [with significant confounding by suicides, presence of other crime, culture, etc.](https://slatestarcodex.com/2016/01/06/guns-and-states/), and laws reflect the local populace, so those natural experiments may be much fewer and more narrow in application than those in other fields, and there's a lot of bad and/or politically motivated analysis to sift through. But one assumes that plenty of smart people are also studying the data, and [researchers sometimes get lucky](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/everyone-knows-money-influences-politics-except-scientists/). Is there high quality research on the effects of guns being carried in public legally?
