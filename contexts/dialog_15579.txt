MAO TSE TUNG: You must inform me at once if any of our people abuse the Tibetans trust and good nature.
TENZIN GYATSO: I have great hopes for the future of our co-operation.
MAO TSE TUNG: It is too early to implement all the clauses of the Seventeen Point Agreement. We will establish a Preparatory Committee for the Autonomous Region of Tibet. The pace of reform must meet with the desires of the Tibetan people. Changes must be made slowly, as you, yourself, judge necessary.
TENZIN GYATSO: I am happy to hear you say this, Chairman Mao. I have created a reform committee to investigate grievances and we have abolished Inherited Tax, and forgiven all money owed the Government by people who are unable to pay.
MAO TSE TUNG: Good. Very good. Tibet is a great country. A wonderful history. Long ago, you even conquered part of China. But now you have fallen behind and we want to help you. In twenty years time you could be ahead of us. Then it will be your turn to help China.
MAO TSE TUNG: You know, I have great respect for your Lord Buddha. He was anti-caste. Anti-corruption. Anti-exploitation. For some, politics and religion can mix.
TENZIN GYATSO: For me, I think such a mix is crucial.
MAO TSE TUNG: Have a sweet. Made in my home province. The kind my mother used to make.
