VICKI: There's something wrong with this picture.
WALTER: What picture?
VICKI: I'm talking about you.
WALTER: Me?
VICKI: Yeah, you.
VICKI: Here's this nice, hard working guy who suddenly appears out of the blue and rides the bus to and from work. I mean, who rides the bus anymore?
WALTER: People without cars.
VICKI: Very weird.
WALTER: No weirder than a sharp, young, good- looking woman working in a lumberyard.
VICKI: What's weird about that?
WALTER: Most women wouldn't choose it.
VICKI: Guess I'm not like most women.
VICKI: You're quiet at work.
WALTER: I'm just quiet.
VICKI: You don't hang out with the other guys.
WALTER: Neither do you.
VICKI: They're all assholes.
VICKI: You never spoke to me before.
WALTER: I thought you were a dyke.
WALTER: Are you?
VICKI: What do you think?
VICKI: Southern light.
WALTER: What?
VICKI: Your windows face south. Northern light is the purest. But southern light is very good.
WALTER: I'll buy a plant.
VICKI: You should buy several. I've got shitty light in my place, but my plants don't seem to mind. Light's important, but it's not everything.
VICKI: You plan to drink both those beers?
WALTER: Sorry.
