HAWKEYE: Henry's got our orders! We're going home!
DUKE: When?
HAWKEYE: Any time. Whenever we want.
DUKE: Be right with you.
SPEARCHUCKER: You mind if we get out of this guy's brain first?
DUKE: What's there to do? You found the sliver.
SPEARCHUCKER: There might be another tiny piece we missed. I want to look around before we close up.
DUKE: Perfectionist.
HAWKEYE: There's no transportation anyway this time of night.
DUKE: We could steal one of the choppers.
HAWKEYE: I looked. Suspicious bastards got them all locked up.
DUKE: Y'all mind the store.
TRAPPER: Four goddam months. And they don't even give you time off for good behavior.
HAWKEYE: See you.
SPEARCHUCKER: It's possible
HAWKEYE: Hang in there.
