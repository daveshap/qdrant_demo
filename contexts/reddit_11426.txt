My girlfriendÂ´s little sister (4) died today a awful death
 

Im sorry for my bad english but I have nobody to talk about this ...

The little sister of my girlfriend died two hours ago and I had to watch it ...  
Her body parts got demolished by a motocycle chain that flew around from a bike accident.

I babysitted her and we walked into the city and I bought her ice-cream and we stoud at the street to just enjoy the moment as at once and a motocycle crashed near us with 100 Km/h into a car ( in a zone with a 20Km/h speed limit) and the chain just broke und tored of her head ...

I will never forget this moment when her head hit the ground and her facial expressions ( I cant explain how she watched but it was horror.

I dont know what to do now ... Im very close to kill my self.

I CANT HANDLE THIS SH\*\*\*T RIGHT NOW

Please guys

Can you please comfort me a bit ...

Im really sorry for my bad english guys ..... ;(
