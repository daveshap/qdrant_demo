TL;DR my depression is making me spend more money than I can afford
Hello everyone!

First a bit about myself: I'm 25 y/o and struggling with a mix of depression and (social) anxiety. I was in therapy for about 9 months and getting medication since the end of therapy (now for about 8 months). 

At first my meds helped me very much; I experienced a somehow "high" in the first two months of medication. I felt more alive and *me* since... well, ever. Everyone told me I glowed so much and changed for the better. I laughed more, was more active and just felt great.

The downside was that the euphoric reaction I experienced made me spend money because I thought "well, what could happen?". In this time I also got a new, higher paying job and one thing led to another. More money meant I could spend more, and because of this euphoric mood I felt that nothing bad could happen to me. Guess who made debts in the last 8 months since then. In the first three months of my meds I spent waaaaay more money than I could afford and I'm still carrying those debts with me.

I'm so fucking sick of this ups and downs of this. I always had some problems with money, but those months completely destroyed my finances. And because of that I feel so absolutely down. I have about 2.000€ debts from simply ***SHOPPING***. I have no idea how to get rid of those debts and just as I was thinking it could not ever get worse, it got worse and my healthcare provider just charged me with over 600€ because of some dumb fees I should have payed the last months (new job and all). I hate everything about me right now and feel like I'm just a burden to everyone, especially to my hard working bf who's trying to help me with my finances. I simply don't want him to pay so many things for me just because I'm so stupid. 

Just needed an outlet to rant sooo, if you all read this far: congrats, you made it!
