EMMETT: I see what you like, she's mighty pretty.
PADEN: And bridle-wise, too. She's the only thing I lost I really cared about. 'Cept for maybe my hat. It's a great one. Got a pretty silver band on it. My head spent three years training it. I surely do miss that hat.
EMMETT: I gotta be going.
PADEN: Going to Turley, was it?
EMMETT: Gotta meet a guy and head out for Silverado.
PADEN: What's Turley like?
EMMETT: It's a town...
PADEN: They got a saloon there?
EMMETT: I expect.
PADEN: Women?
EMMETT: I expect.
