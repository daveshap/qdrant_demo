MAVERICK: You know what really scares me? Living too long. Losing my hair and my teeth...and my guts and my wind. And my brains...Sitting in a room with my hands in my lap, watching daytime TV.
CHARLIE: You don't believe any of this. You don't think you'll ever die.
MAVERICK: That's it, of course. When I'm up there and doing it, I'm cheating it every second. I'm subverting all laws...gravity...whatever. I'm skating the edge of it.
CHARLIE: Winston Churchill.
CHARLIE: What he said...There's nothing so exhilarating as being shot at without result.""
MAVERICK: All you've got is one life. I guess it's worth about the same to every body. You ever see an old woman after her husband has died? And the meaningless years of decline stretch ahead... When you're in the air and doing something really dangerous, you can look ahead... maybe ten seconds. That's your whole future. That's as far as it goes. But imagine what those seconds are worth.
CHARLIE: What if you kill yourself? Think of everything you'll miss. MAVERICK There is lots of stuff I don't know about... Fine wine... great art... the opera. I guess if I live long enough, I'll get to it. If I don't, I'll never miss it.
CHARLIE: Are you really that brave?
MAVERICK: I watched my mother die. Cancer. She had a long time to think about it. They say you reach an agreement with death. Come to accept the fact that pretty soon you won't be here. I didn't see that. She... was very brave...braver than I am. You go up there, there isn't time to think. If you make a mistake, you're just a smudge on the ground. Simplifies funeral arrangements.
CHARLIE: It's just as I thought.
MAVERICK: What?
CHARLIE: You're totally insane.
MAVERICK: Thanks very much. Care for some suchi?.
GOOSE: Come on, we're next.
MAVERICK: What?
GOOSE: Come on, I got over six bucks on the line.
GOOSE: Come on, come on! It's double or nothing.. We're talking twelve bucks American, here.
MAVERICK: I've had enough...for now.
MAVERICK: Come on.
CHARLIE: Where?
MAVERICK: You want to go ballistic?
CHARLIE: I don't know. I don't like being out of control.
