PAUL: I had to smuggle it in here. I guess you're not really supposed to have jewelry.
LETTY: Or be up past ten or fraternize with other patients.
PAUL: I hope you like it. It's a Marquis cut, 1.5 carats. They had one with emeralds around it, but this was simpler, more classic in its lines. Letty?
LETTY: It's, it's really nice, Paul.
LETTY: No, you've done a perfect job.
PAUL: So, what do you say, Let?
PAUL: Sure. We'll save the formal announcement for when you're out. I already told your mother. I hope you don't mind.
LETTY: No, no.
PAUL: So will you?
LETTY: Of course. Yes. I will. I do.
MICHAEL: You missed out on some great broccoli florets at dinner.
LETTY: I wasn't hungry.
MICHAEL: John even managed to lob a load of mashed potatoes into Mrs. Hallstrom's milk.
LETTY: Finally. I was getting tired of watching him try every night.
MICHAEL: Was it bad news--the visit from Peter?
LETTY: Paul.
LETTY: He asked me to marry him.
MICHAEL: Very romantic setting.
LETTY: It was romantic. He's very romantic.
MICHAEL: So are you engaged, or what?
LETTY: What have you done with the ring?
MICHAEL: It's magic.
