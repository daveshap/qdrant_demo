I know it's a small victory but I haven't touched my savings during this year's winter slowdown at work
Winter is hard for landscapers. Work dries up, and the ground doesn't. Even when you have work to do, the ground is either too frozen or too muddy. You go from weekly overtime to on call. Last week I worked 10 hours.

In the Dave Ramsey typology of spenders/savers and nerds/free spirits I am both a nerd (love to budget, every penny has a job) and a spender. So in past years when the lean times came I would incrementally wipe out my savings to maintain the same way of life, defeating the purpose of my obsessive budgeting. 

This year I decided - here's a radical fucking idea - to change my lifestyle in response to a change in income.

I have a beautiful partner, a tiny kitty ðŸ˜º, a full tank of gas, food in the fridge, $28 of "allowance" (grocery) money until next Wednesday, bills paid through 2/15 (through 2/27 as of next paycheck), and most importantly my untouched savings. I have books to read and people to have over for dinner instead of going out. I'm still putting the same percentage of my income towards savings and debt. Just yesterday I put a deposit towards a secured credit card (my first CC ever, at 29yo lol) to start trying to boost my ~~"I love debt" score~~ credit score. Life is good.
