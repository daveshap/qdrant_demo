ANN: Hello there. Well, well! If it isn't the man about town!
EDDIE: All set, Ann?
ANN: Huh? Oh, yes. Let's go. Now, let's see. We want some action in these pictures.
JOHN: Action?
ANN: Um-hum.
EDDIE: That's good.
ANN: No, no, no. This man's going to jump off a roof.
EDDIE: Oh.
ANN: Here. Wait a minute. Let me comb your hair. Sit down. There. That's better.
