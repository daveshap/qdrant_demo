JANEY: Yes?
DENVER: May I come in?
JANEY: What you want?
DENVER: I want to see Mr. and Mrs. Bodwin.
JANEY: Miss Bodwin. They brother and sister, darlin.
DENVER: Oh.
JANEY: What you want'em for?
DENVER: I'm looking for work. I was thinking they might know of some.
JANEY: You Baby Sugg's kin, ain't you?
DENVER: Yes ma'am.
JANEY: I heard your mother took sick, that so?
DENVER: Yes ma'am..
JANEY: Well, come on in. You letting in flies.
JANEY: You know what? I've been here since I was fourteen and I remember like yesterday when Baby Suggs, holy, came here and sat right where you are. Whiteman name of Garner brought her. He and Mr. Bodwin were good friends. That's how she got that house you all live in. Other things too.
DENVER: Yes ma'am.
JANEY: I never went to those woodland services but she was always nice to me. Always. Never be another like her.
DENVER: I miss her.
JANEY: Bet you do. Everybody miss her. That was a good woman...Well, I don't know whether the Bodwins think it or not but they sure could use some extra help.
DENVER: Ya think?
JANEY: They getting older now and I can't take care of 'em like I used to. More and more they keep asking me to sleep over night. Now, I don't want to quit these people but they can't have all my days and nights too. I got my own family needs me. It'll take some convincing but maybe you could come after supper - take care of your mama during the day, then earn a little something at night, how's that?
DENVER: Fine. But what would I do at night?
JANEY: Be here. In case.
DENVER: In case of what?
JANEY: In case the house burn down or bad weather slops the roads so bad I can't get here on time or late guests needed cleaning up after. Anything. Don't ask me what whitefolks need at night.
DENVER: They good whitefolks?
JANEY: Oh yeah. They good. Can't say they ain't good. I wouldn't trade them for another pair, tell you that. But you come back in a few days - give me a chance to lead'em to it. All right?
