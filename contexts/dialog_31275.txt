ELI: Eat up, Book. What's the matter with your appetite?
BOOK: Guess I'm not used to so much.
ELI: Not used to hard work. That's what makes an appetite.
RACHEL: Eli, John is a carpenter. As well as being a fine policeman.
ELI: Eh? Well then, maybe he can go to Zook's barn-raising, eh? See how good a carpenter.
BOOK: Sure.
RACHEL: But... You may not be well enough.
BOOK: I'll drink some more of Stoltzfus' tea.
