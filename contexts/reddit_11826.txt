I can't seem to satisfy my thirst.
So for about a month now I've been drinking about 8-10 bottles of water a day and even then I seem to be incredibly thirsty by the end of the night. I am 24 years old and like to think I'm in good health. I might just be over thinking this but I just hate the feeling of being thirsty all the time.
