How to grow financially?
Hi Reddit, I'm 21 and working a job that only pays 9.50. I don't even have my first car yet, and dont qualify to finance. I don't know where to take my life to improve it. I am always putting alot of work into my resume to get a better paying job but no one ever calls back. I only have ever had 2 jobs though (lasting 9 months, and my current being just started a month ago) so I understand if my lack of experience is holding me back. Do you guys have any suggestions for me to help improve my life financially? I only have a HS diploma, but have been thinking about trying for an electrical apprenticeship whenever I get my first car. I don't think college would be right for me but who knows.... ðŸ˜”

TL;DR : No car, no degree, making 9.50 a hour. How do I improve, or grow?

Revision1: Thank you everyone for the advice, I'm glad to hear about many different possible career routes and I'm grateful for everyone who opens my mind to the possibility of another opportunity!
