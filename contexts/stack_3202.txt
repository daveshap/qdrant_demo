Story about arriving in hell and finding it empty I read this back in the 1980s or 90s. I'm not sure if it was a story in Omni, or in an anthology.The story starts with some guy waking up in what he perceives to be Hell, but he is alone. He is burnt all over from the fires.Then some girl arrives and she is freezing. He gives her the cloak he had and she decides he's the devil.More people trickle in, all thinking this man is the devil. Then an angel appears and says there was some sort of error. That they should all be in Heaven, as Satan had apologized to God or something of the sort and was allowed back.The guy in the story decides to stay and rule in Hell, instead of being just someone else in Heaven.Does anyone else remember this?
