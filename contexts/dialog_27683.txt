MELANIE: No, the birds didn't attack until the children were outside the school. Crows, I think. I don't know, Daddy. Is there a difference between crows and blackbirds?
MRS. BUNDY: There is very definitely a difference, Miss.
MELANIE: They're different, Daddy. Thank you. I think these were crows. Yes, hundreds of them. Yes, they attacked the children, attacked them. Daddy, a little girl was sent to the hospital in Santa Rosa. Well, all right, but you act as if I'm... all right, all right. No, I can't come home now. I just can't, Daddy. How is it there? I mean... are there birds? In the sky? But no trouble. Well, I hope... I don't know when. I simply can't leave now. Tell Mother not to worry. All right, Daddy, good-by.
MRS. BUNDY: They're both perching birds, of course, but of quite different species. The crow is brachyrhynchos. The blackbird is cyanocephalus.
MELANIE: Thank you. Do you know Dan Fawcett's number?
