HENRY: Humpf -- so I was wrong this time. But by God, I wasn't wrong when I mailed you my Diary. You obviously got it.
INDY: I got it and I used it. We found the entrance to the catacombs.
HENRY: Through the library?
INDY: Right.
HENRY: I knew it. And the tomb of Sir Richard?
INDY: Found it.
HENRY: He was actually there? You saw him?
INDY: Well, what was left of him.
HENRY: And his shield... the inscription on Sir Richard's shield...?
INDY: Alexandretta. It's a great moment in Henry's life. He turns aside, lost to himself for a moment, then turns to Indy with joy.
HENRY: Alexandretta... of course... on the pilgrim trail from the Eastern Empire. Oh, Junior...
HENRY: ...you did it.
INDY: No, Dad. You did. Forty years.
HENRY: If only I could have been with you.
INDY: There were rats, Dad.
HENRY: Rats?
INDY: Yeah, big ones. What do the Nazis want with you Dad?
HENRY: They want my diary.
INDY: Yeah?
