STAR MAN: Asshole!!
JENNY: Where did you learn that?
STAR MAN: The cook.
JENNY: We're not going to get a ride tonight.
STAR MAN: I can't stay on this planet.
JENNY: No one's traveling in this weather.
STAR MAN: You promised you would get me to my ship.
JENNY: I will. I will. We still have another day.
STAR MAN: You promised.
JENNY: What do you want from me? There are no cars on this road. I didn't ask for this stupid storm.
JENNY: What are you saying?
STAR MAN: You can stop. I will go on alone.
JENNY: We're too far away to walk. Don't you understand?
