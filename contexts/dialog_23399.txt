FRANCES: I can't see much fun in teaching school. Why don't you go into the beauty business.
MARY: But I like teaching school.
FRANCES: Well, if it's fun for you, it's all right. I get a kick out of my work when the customers aren't too crabby.
MARY: Is Mrs. Redi nice to work for?
FRANCES: Redi's all right.
MARY: She seems rather an odd woman to me.
FRANCES: She's a pretty good sort.
MARY: What does she do with herself after business hours?
MARY: It always seemed to me she was sort of lonely and unhappy.
FRANCES: I guess most people are.
