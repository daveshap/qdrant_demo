WILSON: I've been given a cease and desist on all matters relating to Jerry Fletcher. We're not to discuss him with the press, the N.Y.P.D., anyone. Building police are to arrest him on sight and we're to report any attempt he makes to contact you.
LIZA: This doesn't make sense.
WILSON: It makes perfect sense. Field work is not our oeuvre.
LIZA: I don't like it. Something's wrong.
WILSON: Dr. Jonas thought you might be inclined not to cooperate. Why is that?
LIZA: We don't know who Jonas is. We don't know who it is we're cooperating with.
WILSON: I've had a lot of credentials flashed in my face, Liza. What I saw yesterday, I know not to ask questions. We're out. Shut off. Terminated. <u>Understood</u>?
LIZA: -- Understood.
LAWYER: Liza, settle a bet for us.
LIZA: What do I look like to you? Switzerland?
