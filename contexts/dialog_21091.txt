STEW: I'm sorry nobody could come.
HANK: The rest of the gang had to get out the morning edition - but they'll be down later.
STEW: Now Hank, are you sure they're coming? It will be lonesome without them. Smythe, take this crowd in there and give them a drink. And find out what the boys in the back room want!
SMYTHE: It isn't done, gentlemen! It isn't done, I say! It isn't done!
STEW: Well, Gallagher, you certainly took no chances, did you?
GALLAGHER: I'm sorry, Stew. I asked Hank, and Hank did the rest.
STEW: I see. Hank brought them all. That's all right. We'll give them a drink and throw 'em out. How's that?
GALLAGHER: Okay.
STEW: Smythe! Give them one drink and throw 'em out!
