SEAMUS: May you find the peace you've sought in vain for so long.
AMY: That poor little girl.
SHEA: So many unanswered questions. Why was she buried there. And who killed her?
AMY: It might have been her mother.
SHEA: We don't have proof of that.
AMY: The style of dress on the girl... it coincides with the era Marion Foster killed herself. Who else could have gone in there and done something like that?
WILL: We'll never know for sure.
SEAMUS: Hopefully the whole sad chapter is over. And everyone, including your family, will find peace. WILL I just want to...thank all of you, for everything you've done for us.
