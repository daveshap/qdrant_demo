Why is student debt treated differently to other debts in Bankruptcy?
From my searches, the distinction started with Bankruptcy Reform Act of 1978, continued with the Bankruptcy Amendments and Federal Judgeship Act of 1984 and led to it's current state with Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act in 2005. But what was the motivation for the changes and what was the reasoning for and against?

EDIT: Everyone's great comments spurred some more google searches. I stumbled on a great study that covers the whole topic in depth: [Private Student Loans and BAPCPA: Did Four-Year Undergraduates Benefit from the Increased Collectability of Student Loans?](http://edpolicy.umich.edu/files/ang-jimenez-bankruptcy-abuse-prevention-consumer-protection-act.pdf)
