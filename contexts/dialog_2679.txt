ORCHID: I'm doing okay. Been reading about your show, it's all over everywhere. I watched it's all over everywhere. I watched it once. I thought you said there would be no buffoonery.
DELACROIX: You going to attack me too. The show is a hit. Aren't you happy for me?
ORCHID: Of course I'm happy for you. You've worked very hard for your success.
DELACROIX: Yes I have, very hard. Has Daddy called?
ORCHID: No.
DELACROIX: Not at all?
ORCHID: You know how your Daddy is.
DELACROIX: If and when he calls, please don't forget to ask him if he's seen Mantan.
ORCHID: I won't forget. When are you coming up here to see your mother?
DELACROIX: Soon.
