"Struggle Meals"
I stumbled across this show on Hulu called "Struggle Meals" and it shows you how to cook food on the cheap. It uses things like sauce packets from fast food restaurants and food that is about to expire. Each serving is under $2.  It's worth a look if you're stuck home with not much food in your fridge.
