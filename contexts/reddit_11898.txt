So when are you having kids?
My wonderful mother-in-law has been so kind to keep asking me for the last two years when I will finally be giving her a grand baby. 

My husband and I married three years ago after I had graduated college. I have an insane amount of student debt and pay over $1200/month just in loans. Because of this, we can't get a house, I can't buy a new vehicle, and for the love of god I can't afford a kid. My husband knew this going into it. He's super supportive. I love him very much. 

But today I finally snapped. I told my MIL that she will not be getting any grandkids out of me anytime soon and she better get used to the idea. A child would be wonderful. Yes I want to carry a baby and bring it into this world and love it but it is not an option at this point. A child, at this point in time, is an expense that we cannot afford. We cannot give it its own room. And I've seen the prices of diapers alone and there is no way I could afford those on top of everything else. So I have to tell my baby-hungry-uterus no. No babies. Not until the loans come down and the pay goes up. Not until we have a house. Not until we can give it the life it deserves. 

I had her in tears. I feel terrible. Part of me says that she had this coming. Part of me sees the lonely mother whose four babies are all grown up and left her with a big empty house. I'm not sure how I'm going to be able to look her in the eye after this.
