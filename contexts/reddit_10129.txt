Health Video Series
Hello all!

I'm a SA grad student at Binghamton University. Currently I have been developing a weekly web series that highlights health and wellness news and events happening at the university. I've been interested in seeing if other colleges and universities have similar programs and what makes them effective. I'm trying really hard to make this a success.
