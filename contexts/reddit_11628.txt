He is leaving.
He is a friend, so I have no right to feel this busted up about him moving away.  It is a tough one because I am in a long-term relationship with a man I absolutely adore.  I never thought I would have my head turned again.  I was settled and content.  This guy just swept in and shook up everything.  We shared books and music.  We shared thoughts from the silly to the profound. Nothing untoward ever occurred, just the nebulous feeling that something could happen.  Now, I have to watch him go and try to fit back into the world that was here before he came.
