2020 APs are simply unfair
Long rant below:

1. **Questions are not equal in difficulty:** The AP tests are not curved, and thus there is a preset number of points necessary for a certain score. That would be okay if the tests were like normal, but when there are tons of different prompts for tons of different students, how can you guarantee equal difficulty? Especially in a problem set with only two problems. How can you say one DBQ is objectively equal in difficulty to another? In my personal experience, the AP Physics 1 test seems to completely vary in difficulty. You have some problems that are straightforward fundamentals and others that are far more complicated. It seems completely unfair, and with the College Board not releasing much information on how different problems will be graded, it honestly makes some students who clearly received more difficult prompts feel left in the dark.
2. **A 45-minute test is not enough to test 1 year's worth of material**. When you have a test that is in a new environment, with the added stress of submitting your test in the given time, there is such a high chance of making one stupid mistake. When the tests are normal, one stupid mistake is okay because you have the rest of the test to compensate. But when you're tested with such a small number of questions, getting caught on a question/slipping up once or twice can drastically change your score. On top of that, so much is based simply on how lucky you get with your prompt. In all honesty, I am much better at physics than apush, but got a prompt on apush that I was very knowledgable about and got a prompt on physics that I was not as knowledgable about. With such a small test, there is simply just too much variance for it to be an accurate representation of one's knowledge. 
3. **The College Board did not release enough materials in preparation**. The College Board really emphasized their platform, releasing tons of information on how it was going to work and how students should take the test. While this was helpful, it is important to note that some tests this year, notably maths and sciences, were drastically changed. All the College Board did to compensate for this change was to release 2 practice tests online on their YouTube channel, but these tests 1. seemed to be rough estimates of the actual test and not reflect the test much and 2. are simply not enough for students. The College Board consistently writes convoluted questions in efforts to make questions on simple concepts more difficult. When one has experience with these questions, they can get used to the format, but without much practice of the new format, the test felt almost completely blind. 
4. **Foreign students** have to take the tests at ridiculous times. I don't know much about this as I live in America, but it seems that kids in foreign countries have to take the tests either ridiculously early or ridiculously late. 

TL;DR Fuck the College Board
