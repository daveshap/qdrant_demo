Going from suicidal to very happy all in the same day
I feel so lonely because I've never found anyone else who feels the same way. I have depression and ever since the really really bad times I've never quite related to any other depressed person. For example fake smiling (never had to do that unless I was on the brink of tears at school) I genuinely felt happy but I was still depressed.

Most of the times I think of suicide when a minor thing bothers me. Like when a friend unconsciously leave me out I think of suicide and I start tearing because of suicidal thoughts. Just minor things. I can be pretty genuinely happy beforehand but a minor thing happens and I'm emotionally unstable. Or one day I can be sure I just want to die and the next I can feel like I'm on top of the world. I also mainly get depressed when I'm on my own and not with friends.

Anyone else feel like that? Or is it just me?

EDIT: Didn't expect this to blow up. Thanks for all the comments. I truly appreciate all of them. Really!
