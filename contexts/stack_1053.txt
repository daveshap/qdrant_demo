ubuntu install expert mode which kernel choose When I set up a fresh Ubuntu Server installation in expert mode after the partitioning comes a point where you have to select the linux kernel. There are shown about 5 options like linux-generic, linux-image-... and others. The standard selection is linux-generic but I don't exactly know which one to select.Can someone explain which kernel to use and why? What does this generally effect? What are the differences between the kernel? What does kernel mean?
