THE PRESIDENT: What's that?
KENNY: Oh, just a bunch of crap about withdrawing our Jupiter missiles in Turkey if the Soviets'll do the same in Cuba.
THE PRESIDENT: I don't want to listen to this again.
KENNY: If we made a trade, we'd be giving in to extortion, and NATO would never trust us again. We'll get clobbered in world opinion.
THE PRESIDENT: It's a goddman trial balloon. Trial is the operative word, here.
KENNY: Then somebody'd better deny it publicly.
THE PRESIDENT: Jesus Christ, O'Donnell, you're the one saying we need to move forward on a political solution.
KENNY: Yeah, a good political solution.
