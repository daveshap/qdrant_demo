SOOO annoyed with anxiety’s physical symptoms?????
Hi peoples! Does anyone else just get so fed up with the physical and health related symptoms that come with anxiety? It’s SO many it’s just ridiculous - sweating, dry mouth, upset stomach, nausea, difficulty breathing, ear ringing, fatigue, confusion, dissociation, headaches, insomnia, heart racing.... and honestly so many more! The amount of physical symptoms drives me nuts... because I experience ALL OF THEM! On and off at random :/ anyone else relate? It always makes me feel like I have something more wrong with me than just anxiety that I have some crazy underlying illness..
