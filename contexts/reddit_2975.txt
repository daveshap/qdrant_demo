I have made upwards of $75k a year. I just applied as a fish gut processor for minimum wage. Any starting over advice?
Long story short, I've moved to a new town 3500 miles away. The market is entirely different, and cost of living much lower, so basically any entry level position has career potential. 

My question is this. How do I submit a Cover Letter for a job that requires "basic english" as a -preferred- skill while not seeming over qualified?

As it sits right now I'm stating, basically...

"I'm new to town, looking for steady reliable work, somewhere where I can work my way up while building an honest and professional relationship with a company where hard work and efficiency will be rewarded" or some variation.

Any advice?
