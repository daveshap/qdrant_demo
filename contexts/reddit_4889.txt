please dont get mad. i need help/advice
hello. i hope this doesn't rub off people the wrong way or come off as a trigger to people. 

anyone here who lost their mom/dad to suicide? And how hasnit affected you while growing up? 

i'm asking because lately i've been having an intense desire to hang myself outside. i have a two year old beautiful loving son but even seeing his face doesn't make these thoughts go away. i even think it's for the best if i'm gone, he'll be better off with his dad. i just have this feeling that they'd all be relieved if i'm dead
