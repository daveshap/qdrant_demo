MR. WHITE: Joe, you're making a terrible mistake I can't let you make.
EDDIE: Stop pointing your fuckin' gun at daddy!
JOE: Don't worry, Eddie. Me and Larry have been friends a long time, he ain't gonna shoot. We like each other too much.
MR. WHITE: Joe, if you kill that man, you die next. Repeat, if you kill that man, you die next!
