CLARENCE: I grow it on my window-sill. The lights really great there and I'm up high enough so you can't see it from the street.
ELLIOT: Ha ha ha. No really, where does it come from?
CLARENCE: Coco leaves. You see, they take the leaves and mash it down until it's kind of a paste -
ELLIOT: Look, Dick, I don't -
CLARENCE: No problem, Elliot. I'm just fuckin' wit ya, that's all. Actually, I'll tell you but you gotta keep it quiet. Understand, if Dick didn't assure me you're good people I'd just tell ya, none of your fuckin' business. But, as a sign of good faith, here it goes: I gotta friend in the department.
ELLIOT: What department?
CLARENCE: What do you think, eightball?
ELLIOT: The police department?
CLARENCE: Duh. What else would I be talking about? Now stop askin' stupid doorknob questions. Well, a year and a half ago, this friend of mine got access to the evidence room for an hour. He snagged this coke. But, he's a good cop with a wife and a kid, so he sat on it for a year and a half until he found a guy he could trust.
ELLIOT: He trusts you?
CLARENCE: We were in Four H together. We've known each other since childhood. So, I'm handling the sales part. He's my silent partner and he knows if I get fucked up, I won't drop dime on him. I didn't tell you nothin' and you didn't hear nothin'.
ELLIOT: Sure. I didn't hear anything.
