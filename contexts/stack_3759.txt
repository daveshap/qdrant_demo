which non parametric test to use? I'll start with saying I am not an expert in stats and had some basic knowledge of Anova but was now told to use the nonparametric test in my project and I'm lost.<br>My design:I have two groups, low and high level of the second language (independent v.)tested in two conditions: gesture/ no gesture (independent v.)for a fluency measure(speech rate) at one point in time (dependent v.)Which would be the appropriate test to run in this case?
