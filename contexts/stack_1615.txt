Why the voltage suddenly reduces when thyristors change from forward blocking to conduction mode As per the diagram:v-I characteristics of SCR is a graph of anode current I A on y-axis &amp; anode to cathode Voltage plotted on x-axis v-I characteristics can be split into two parts namely Forward Characteristics &amp; Reverse Characteristics.Now why does the Vak suddenly drops to Vh during conduction... This is unlike a diode where the voltage remains constant even after avalanche breakdown...Please can anyone explain this isusue to me!
