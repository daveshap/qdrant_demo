Ground and earth layers on PCB I am designing a digital board with USB input and output.Shield of USB is connected to a chassis ground as per USB specs and connected to GND through a R and C in parallelUSB power has a common mode choke inline ( negative going to GND) and then it connects (after CMC) to DGNDMy question is: on a PCB with as many layers as I want , should I make 2 full planes of grounds?  1. GND (only used before CMC on input and after CMC on output)  2. AGND (this is required for sure)Both GND and AGND will be connected to chassis ground. Connection betwen GND and AGND will be using common mode chokes.
