MALLOY: Lestat escaped the fire!
LOUIS: He hadn't even been there. And all those years I thought he was dead.
LESTAT: I'm so glad you're here Louis... I've dreamed of your coming...
LOUIS: Don't try to speak... it's alright...
LESTAT: I didn't mean to let them do it... that Santiago, he tricked me...
LOUIS: That's all past, Lestat.
LESTAT: Yes. Past... she should never have been one of us...
LESTAT: Still beautiful Louis. You always were the strong one.
LOUIS: Don't fear me, Lestat. I bring you no harm.
LESTAT: You've come back to me, Louis? You've come again to me?
LOUIS: It's only a siren...
LESTAT: I can't bear it Louis! The machines out there, that fly and that roar! And such lights! They make the night brighter than the day!
LOUIS: And they frighten you?
LESTAT: You know I love the dark. But there's no dark anymore.
LOUIS: It's false light, Lestat. It can't harm you...
LESTAT: If you stayed with me Louis, I could venture out... little by little... become the old Lestat.
LOUIS: I have to go now Lestat...
LESTAT: You remember how I was, Louis.. the vampire Lestat...
LOUIS: Yes. I remember...
LESTAT: I tried to tell you Louis... that night in Paris... when I first came to you... no-one can refuse the dark gift, Louis... not even you.
LOUIS: I tried...
LESTAT: And the more you tried, the more I wanted you... a vampire with your beautiful, suffering human heart. And how you suffered... I need your forgiveness, Louis.
LOUIS: You have it...
