Should I reply to this rejection letter?
I just received this rejection letter for my dream job:

" Thank you for applying for the role of \*\*\*\* at \*\*\*\*. I’m sorry it has taken us so long to get back to you but we had over 700 applicants for the position and it took us some time to go through each one. We’ve interviewed a selection of applicants who looked to have the very specific experience we need at this stage and have now hired for this role. We will no doubt be looking to bring more people on board over the next few months and we’d like to keep your details on file if that’s ok with you?

We will be updating our twitter, Instagram and newsletter subscribers with other vacancies as they arise, though we can also let you know via email if you’d prefer.

We can see that you spent some time on your application, though given the large number of applicants we cannot provide feedback on each response.  (....)"

I really want to work for this company, so I'm now wondering if I should message them back to try to stand out a bit from the 700(!!!!) others if they really have other openings in the near future.

I know this is a standard response, but should I reply to this anyway? - And if so, what do I write?
