SCHINDLER: No, I'm not losing money, that's not the point.
STERN: What other point is -
SCHINDLER: It's dangerous. It's dangerous, to me, personally.
SCHINDLER: You have to understand, Goeth's under enormous pressure. You have to think of it in his situation. He's got this whole place to run, he's responsible for everything that goes on here, all these people - he's got a lot of things to worry about. And he's got the war. Which brings out the worst in people. Never the good, always the bad. Always the bad. But in normal circumstances, he wouldn't be like this. He'd be all right. There'd be just the good aspects of him. Which is a wonderful crook. A guy who loves good food, good wine, the ladies, making money...
STERN: And killing.

STERN: There's nothing you can do. I'm not asking you to do anything. You came into my office.
