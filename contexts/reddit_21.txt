Poopy parents
So I got my license recently and been driving myself around to school, friends etc, but now my parents want to know exactly where I am all the time. I know it's just for their peace of mind to make sure I'm safe and what not, but I feel like I shouldn't need to do this every time I go anywhere. I said "that's stupid" and now they won't let me drive unless I text them my whereabouts all the time. Thoughts?

Edit: Thanks everyone for all the advice, guess I will be paying along for a while.
