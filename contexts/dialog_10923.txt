ROYCE: C'mon, Jordan. Do the headwork with me.
JORDAN: It's done with, Royce. Let it go.
ROYCE: Someone screwed you over like this, left unanswered charges hanging over your head, and you're not gonna fight back?
JORDAN: I'm tired of fighting back. I just wanted to come home and be safe and have you here and the river there and just forget the rest of the world, okay?
ROYCE: Well, before you crawl off to die, Jordan, give me five minutes of good headwork.
ROYCE: John James Urgayle." The Chief."
JORDAN: What about him.
JORDAN: Instructors typically pull three year assignments. This guy's in and out in one year -- your year. That sound right?
JORDAN: Sounds like an amazing coincidence.
ROYCE: Or like maybe he was baby sitting a problem child for the Navy.
JORDAN: I don't know, I don't care.
ROYCE: Well, pardon me if I do. Now who else? Who could've leveraged a class officer like that? C'mon, Jordan, keep your head in the game.
