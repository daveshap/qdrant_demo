PISCANO: I've never trusted him. And you know I got eyes...
PISCANO: ...behind my head. They trust that scumbag, I don't. Right now, the way I feel, I'll hit the two of them in the head with a fuckin' shovel.
PISCANO'S MOTHER: All right, take it easy now, take it easy.
PISCANO: Mom, I'm sorry, they're beatin' me left and right. Ma, I'm sorry. I'm all upset.
PISCANO'S MOTHER: I know, but that's enough.
PISCANO: You know - You know - You know what they're doin' to me?
PISCANO'S MOTHER: I know it, I know it.
PISCANO: I can't take this no more. Back and forth, back and forth.
PISCANO'S MOTHER: Take it easy, though.
PISCANO: All right, all right. But I - I -
PISCANO'S MOTHER: You'll get a heart attack like that.
PISCANO: You know, I - I'm too upset right now. And - An end has to be put to this.
