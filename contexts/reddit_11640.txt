I can't use public bathrooms.
I know, it sounds stupid, but it really does bother me.  If I really have to go and I'm nowhere near home, I'll try to pee at work and... it just hurts.  I think I have what's called [Paruresis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paruresis) and I'm just not able to 'let go' and well, pee.  At best, a teensy trickle will come out, but then the person in the other stall will cough or shift their feet, and my bladder will quite literally seize up and it's so painful.  I hate that I can't do this simple bodily function just because another human is inside the room.  

I'll take pity, or advice, or whatever at this point.  And no, I'm not allowed to have headphones, which is the only object in the world, besides my own bathroom at home, that can help me pee.  So I am doomed to suffer, pretty much.  

EDIT:  I don't like doing this, but I should clarify that I'm a lady, so no urinals for me.  Ya think having a closed off stall would be easier, but it's just not :(
