Got fired, do I need to personally deliver the company's property back?
I am a cleaner, and today I was terminated I over voicemail. The thing is, I still have their cleaning equipment that I had signed out. I am aware that I have to return it, but the office is a 35 minute drive, which is a huge financial burden for me. Not to mention the fact that I was at work with a supervisor the night before, and therefore I should have been fired then and there.

Do i personally have to deliver the supplies back, or can I just tell them to send a courier? If I refuse, am I technically stealing this property, even though they are free to relinquish it from me when they want? Can they bill me or withhold my final check?

EDIT: here's the ending to the story. I called my employers and told them that I will drop off the equipment at my earliest convenience, definitely within 30 days. They became anxious because I had keys to their accounts. If I kept the keys even tonight, then they would have to tell their customer about the security risk, they told me. 

I stated that I completely understand, but the city is a long drive and that it is a burden. They said we will give you compensation for gas, but if you don't comply we'll go to the police(which is standard protocol for them). I replied that I'm not withholding anything, and they can choose to grab it anytime they want, but I agreed to drop it off. 

Thanks everyone for your support!
