Im a top 3 public university student wondering if he should invest more time in GPA or networking to get a good job.
Hi everyone! I’m wondering if i should spend my time maintaining a high gpa or networking by creating close relationships with many people. I can’t do both. Ive tried. it’s killing me, so i decided i should pick one. I would love all the input from personal experience you all have had looking for jobs after college. Thanks everyone!
