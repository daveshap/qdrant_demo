GREER: You okay?
EPPS: Yeah. Fine. I just thought I heard something is all.
GREER: What?
EPPS: Nothing. Let's get outa here.
GREER: Can't find the shotgun.
MURPHY: So whoever did this now has our shotgun.
GREER: Doesn't look like it much matters.
EPPS: What do we do with him?
MURPHY: Leave him till we can get some help. From now on, nobody comes down here.
GREER: What about the gold?
MURPHY: Leave it.
GREER: Now hold up just a minute. Let's be reasonable here.
MURPHY: You think whoever did this is reasonable?
GREER: All I'm saying is that gold's worth a lot more to us now than it ever was.
EPPS: I can't believe you. Dodge's dead and all you can think about is cashing in your share.
GREER: I didn't sign up to go home empty handed. And I sure ain't gonna roll over for the freaky motherfucker did this.
MURPHY: Nobody's going anywhere with that gold now. Anybody tries to board, we'll know about it. You can do what you want, Greer. But neither of us is gonna risk saving your ass down here if it comes to that.
GREER: Fine with me.
