A Robin Hood based story I recall a children's story i enjoyed.  I can give scraps of memory - can anyone help identify?  There were figurines of Robin Hood and Sherwood Forest.The kids would enter that world in their sleep.Their bed would appear as a plateau in that world.What happened to the figurines in daytime affected the alternate world: on one occasion the figurines were used to demonstrate baseball plays and the next night in Sherwood Forest universe, the big thing was baseball.There were two house-type dolls who were insanely furious about being neglected.Any help appreciated.
