Anyone else have Boomer parent's who expect to be taken care of financially?
Pretty much as the title says. It's mostly my mother who seems all hurt when I pointed out that me being able to financially take care of them is the same chances as a snowballs in hell. I can *reasonably* take care of myself, but money is tight and I budget like a champ. I *can't* take care of them. The thing that really had me rolling my eyes was the expectation that she would be taken care of like her siblings (not her) took care of my grandmother... My grandmother who at the age of 96 died with 350K in her retirement account. Where as my mother has zero money in any form of retirement and never completed high school/GED. 
 
So anyone else have parent's who expected their children to pull them out of poverty? Are you attempting to frugal/poverty budget in some money for them? I personally garden and can help out with food but as for any extra cash I'm pretty much pulling up empty pockets.
