PINKER: Bud White, what brings you down to the basement?
BUD: I got a few Nite Owl questions.
PINKER: I don't know if you read the papers, but that case is closed.
BUD: I'm tying up loose ends. Padding my report. You know how it goes.
PINKER: What do you want to know?
BUD: Anything off. Anything that didn't make sense.
PINKER: You mean beside the fact that thirty-five out of forty-five rounds were gratuitous? I can't think of anything.
BUD: Whose shoe?
PINKER: Susan Lefferts.
BUD: If she was sitting here, then it's facing the wrong way. What are these smears in the blood?
PINKER: It looks like she was flailing, trying to get away.
BUD: But she's moving away from the door. Who was sitting at this table?
PINKER: Dick Stensland. Had to be dumb panic. If she knew him she would've been sitting with him... Right?
