Letters of Rec 3 (going on 4) Years out of Undergrad...Advice?
Hello,

I will be applying for SAHE programs this fall. I am 3 (going on 4) years out of my undergraduate degree, working in finance, and looking to make the career shift to align more with my passions/career goals.

As Iâ€™ve started looking at application requirements, almost all programs request at least 1 (some even 2) letters of recommendation from a faculty member. 

Now I did well in college and I could definitely get letters from old professors, but I do not feel like they would best recommend my strengths, growth, ability to excel in the programs, etc. This is mainly because it has been 3-7 years since some of them taught me and I feel like I have numerous other mentors that would be able to give a more accurate insight into my academics, character, and work ethic. 

Does anyone have any insight into this? 
Anyone been in this position or any admissions pros have any advice?

Would it make sense to reach out to the university as I apply to explain my situation?

Please let me know what you think!
