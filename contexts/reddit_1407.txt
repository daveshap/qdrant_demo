Looking back at my life I realized that I had stopped living life. I was literally just trying to get to the next day.
Just living in the thought of tomorrow. It was like I was not living. Just waiting.

And the trouble was that, I didn't know what I was waiting for, I was kind of scared for what it might be.

Does anyone feel that way too?
