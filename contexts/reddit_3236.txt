Is it time for me to move on if acquiring a Masters isn't a valid reason to request a pay increase?
This is a throwaway, family knows my actual account and I'm kind of embarrassed asking about this.

I took a known pay cut going to work for this University, it's a top-rated school in the US and rationalized the pay cut with the benefit of free school. Three years in I've acquired my Masters (Electrical Engineering) and approached my boss for what can be done about increasing my compensation to reflect my new skill-set/work I've been doing. I'm currently enrolled in a PhD program for the school, Masters was just a little victory, but I'm not making much more than when I started. Boss told me it's an HR issue, he can do what he can but in the end it comes to their decision and they have a bad history with not crediting their own institution's degrees as a valid reason for pay increase.

I want to continue for the PhD but I found out one of the employees we just hired with not much more than a Masters is making significantly more than me. To make it worse he's working under me as I've started to work point on most of the work I'm involved in. I'm at least another two years from finishing my PhD but given the fact I'm making close to 3x less my current market value I'm finding it hard to stay versus finding a new place and juggling a more demanding workplace with remaining schoolwork/research.

Honestly, I'm just at a loss for what I should do. I want to talk to HR or someone involved in the process but I don't even know where to begin.

Edit for clarification:

This position is a full time staff position at a University, not a TA or RA position. If I was in an RA/TA position the Masters would have increased the stipend amount due to the increase in education level.
