JAKE: Emmett! Am I glad to see you!
EMMETT: Howdy, Jake. What's going on here?
JAKE: You got me. This is a crazy town, Emmett. I think we ought to get out of here.
JAKE: All I did was kiss a girl.
EMMETT: That's why they got you in jail?
JAKE: Yeah, I kissed a girl and this guy didn't like it and we had some words, so I decided to get out of there.
JAKE: So I did, I got out of there, I don't want no trouble. You know me. So I walked out on the street and the fella tried to shoot me in the back.
EMMETT: ...And you had to kill him?
JAKE: No, no, no! I winged him, and he dropped his gun.
EMMETT: You're in here for winging a guy?
JAKE: Well, no, not exactly. See then his friend opened up on me.
EMMETT: What friend is that?
JAKE: The one with the shotgun.
