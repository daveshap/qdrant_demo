"Has anyone ever been accepted from Harvard but rejected from Princeton?"
>Robert Rubin. Harvard College Class of 1960, Treasury Secretary during the Clinton administration.

>In his book, he wrote:

>"After graduation, I sent a tongue-in-cheek letter to the dean of admissions at Princeton, to which I had not been accepted four years earlier. "I imagine you track the people you graduate," I wrote. "I thought you might be interested to know what happened to one of the people you rejected. I just wanted to tell you that I graduated from Harvard summa cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa." 

>The dean wrote me back, "Thank you for your note. Every year, we at Princeton feel it is our duty to reject a certain number of highly qualified people so that Harvard can have some good students too."

*Oof.*
