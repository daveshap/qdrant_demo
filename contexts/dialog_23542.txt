JULIET: Have you seen Hugo?
ALEX: No. Any idea which channel he's on?
ALEX: No, she's not in. Without waiting for any more, he replaces the reciever and walks to the door, where he picks up the mail. On his way back from the door, David emerges, ready to go to work.
ALEX: Have you seen him?
DAVID: Alex, I don't have the time --
ALEX: Yes or no, yes or no, yes or --
DAVID: No.
ALEX: David hasn't seen him either.
JULIET: So I gathered.
ALEX: Maybe he didn't like us.
JULIET: David?
ALEX: Hugo.
JULIET: His car's still there.
ALEX: He's got a car?
JULIET: So what's wrong with that?
ALEX: What sort of car?
JULIET: Alex, how shouldI know? I'm just a girl.
ALEX: I will ask you once more, what sort of car --
JULIET: A blue one, OK. And it's still there.
ALEX: Hugo. Hugo. Sorry about this, but can you open the door? It's us, Hugo, your flatmates and companions. Your new-found friends. He's not in. He's left and we'll probably never see him again.
JULIET: Alex, the key is in the keyhole on the other side.
ALEX: So?
JULIET: Open it.
ALEX: You want me to kick it open?
JULIET: Yes.
ALEX: Now?
JULIET: Yes.
ALEX: All right. No problem.
