Students over utilizing services?
tl;dr: How do I politely suggest that a student limit the number of appointments they schedule with me when they are coming in too frequently?

I work as an academic advisor, and I'm not sure how to handle this situation. I want to preface this by saying that I 100% want my students to feel comfortable seeking me out as a resource whenever they need to, but I have a few students who I think are maybe scheduling *too many* advising appointments. My institution doesn't have required advising, but we recommend that students come in once per semester to make sure they are on track. I also advise an upper level program, so we also need to make sure they are meeting the admissions requirements for our program. I have one student in particular who has scheduled with me now 6 times this academic year (about once a month). Each time we aren't necessarily discussing anything new (I would say maybe 2-3 of the meetings were absolutely necessary), and some of the questions could have easily been answered via email.

Again, I want students to feel comfortable coming in, but when students do this they clog up the appointment system for other students who haven't been able to meet with me yet this semester (or this year). With this last meeting, I think I was able to gracefully suggest that he email his questions and not feel obligated to come back out for another appointment (our location is also not super convenient for students to get to). However, based on the current pattern of behavior I have a feeling he's going to schedule another appointment before the end of the semester. Has anyone ever had to delicately tell a student that they're over utilizing services?
