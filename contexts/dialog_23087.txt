DEWEY: Sheriff just radioed me. I'm gonna check out a possible lead. Thought you might like to join me.
GALE: What kind of lead?
DEWEY: A car was spotted in the bushes a little ways up the road.
GALE: I'd love to. If you're sure it's alright?
DEWEY: Ma'am, I am the Deputy of this town.
GALE: Can I bring Kenny?
DEWEY: NO! I mean... I should probably take just you.
