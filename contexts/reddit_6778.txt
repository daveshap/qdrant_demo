Why do these recruiters from LinkedIn instantly want to jump onto a phone call with little to no information beforehand?
I get messages almost daily by recruiters that are like:

"Wow, your resume is so cool, let's set up a call to discuss [Generic Title 3]"

My resume is usually only tangentially related to the position they are contacting me about, but I would totally be open to seeing if it's a good fit. The thing is they would rather ghost me than give me information through LinkedIn or email. I just don't want to waste my time or theirs. Based on the list of duties I could probably tell instantly if it's something I would want to do. Are they scared that I will find the position myself and bypass them?

I'm just kind of ranting, but it's annoying that they are losing a candidate that would be interested otherwise.
