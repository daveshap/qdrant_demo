At my current job for 8 months, first job out of college. Recently interviewed for a better company/better job where a family friend works. I will hear their decision at 11AM tomorrow. If I get the job, what do I say to my boss/team at my current job? I am nervous and have never done this before.
I feel like a dick if I get this new job and leave my current job. I know I shouldn’t feel that way but I’m nervous as to what to say and how to go about it if I get this new job. PLEASE HELP!!!!
