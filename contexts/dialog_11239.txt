MEMPHIS: This Eleanor's been living at the International Towers for 3 years now.
TOBY: Who's Eleanor?""
MEMPHIS: The 167 Mustang Shelby Mustang GT-500.
TOBY: Why do you call it Eleanor?""
MEMPHIS: All the vehicles get code names. Female names. You say Eleanor lives at such and such... " and no one listening on the waves is the wiser ..."
DONNY ASTRICKY: Eleanor is Memphis' unicorn.""
MEMPHIS: And there she is --
TOBY: It looks just like a regular Mustang --
KIP: Don't go there, Toby --
MEMPHIS: She's not. Carroll Shelby tweaked the Mustang's High-Performance 289 engine and got it legally rated for the street at 450 horsepower ... But its actual output is closer to 600 ...
TOBY: So she flies -
MEMPHIS: She soars -
