SUZY: Just because someone's looking for a nice guy doesn't make them desperate.
GREG: How about rapacious and love- starved?
SUZY: No.
GREG: It is easier to be killed by a terrorist --
SUZY: It is not --
GREG: Right, right.
SAM: Anyway, Victoria's nice.
SUZY: Would you follow <U>her</U> through an airport?
SAM: Look, I met somebody. She's good, and capable and smart. We hit it off. We can't spend your life chasing after fantasies.
ANNIE: Hi.
SAM: Hi. So far so good. So. What should we talk about? How insecure we were in high school. Shirley Votypka, the first girl I ever felt up. Health. What about health? Did you know that eating six macadamia nuts is the equivalent of eating a steak?
ANNIE: Shhhh --
BECKY: You're going to miss the train.
ANNIE: No, I'm not.
BECKY: What are your plans in New York?
ANNIE: We're going to the Rainbow Room and the symphony tomorrow night.
BECKY: I love the symphony.
ANNIE: I hate it. I'm so happy, Becky. Finally I feel happy. This is right. This is real. Everything else is what happens when you watch too many movies and completely lose sight of what counts. Please don't tell anyone about what happened. Sleepless in Seattle" is history."
JESSICA: This is the best movie I've ever seen in my life.
JONAH: I don't get it.
JESSICA: You have to go to her, Jonah. You have to find her.
JONAH: Do you know how much it costs to go to New York?
JESSICA: Nobody knows. It changes practically every day. How much money do you have?
JONAH: Eighty dollars.
JESSICA: I have forty-two. So that would definitely cover taxicabs, I think.
JONAH: But how am I going to get there?
