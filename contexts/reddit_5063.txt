How do you find the motivation to keep applying?
Hi there, 23 year old and graduated last May. After recently moving to a new city back in with my parents I have been on the hunt for a job for the past 4 months. I have applied to maybe 50 jobs and have only recieved 2 interviews (1 Starbucks and another because my friend worked for the company) and have received only rejections. I am starting to feel a little hopeless and depressed. What can I do to drive these feelings away and keep applying? Like I said new city so I don't have any friends and I spend most of my time at home to babysit. I try and spend my free time outside exercising to escape the SADs but it is getting tough and just had a mini breakdown. Any personal experiences or advice is welcome.

Edit: Thanks everybody its hard but I will keep on pushing. And I guess look for new hobbies that don't cost money.
