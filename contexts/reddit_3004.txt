I keep getting fired from corporate jobs…what is my next career move??
I am getting really frustrated and disappointed in myself. I am unable to keep a job that pays me enough to make a decent living. I had a pretty good paying job at a corporate healthcare technology company as a proposal and marketing communications specialist but I was only able to keep it for 2 months. I took it very seriously. However, as hard as I tried, I was unable to maintain my focus throughout the entire day, no matter how many milligrams of Ritilin I was prescribed. I also had issues with punctuality which ultimately lead this company to fire me last Friday. While I was late to the office just a couple of times, it was more an issue of making sure I was getting to all the meetings on time, and there were probably 10 to 12 meetings each week. The last straw for this company was when I missed an entire meeting because another meeting ran overtime into the next. This is still my fault because I needed to have better time management and communicate to the head of the first meeting that I needed to leave at a certain time in order to make the next one… I am unable to adhere to a rigid corporate schedule or maintain my focus during extra long meetings. 

Anyways, I am very disappointed and I feel like a total fuckup. I think I need a new career path, because I have had these same issues in the past. I also have creative talents that I would like to explore further and see if they translate to something I am better suited for. Please let me know if the community could recommend a decent paying career path that would highlight my skills and incorporate some of the things I am passionate about. I could also be interested in going back to school if necessary, (and if the debt required to do so isn’t too outrageous). Also, does anyone think remote work might be a good option for me?
