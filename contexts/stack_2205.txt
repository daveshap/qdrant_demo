Maximum damage for Varus 's Q arrow I have a question on Varus champion on his Q ability.At max arrow range after we hit Q the first time, we have 2-3 seconds more to wait for the spell to go off.My question is during that wait for the second Q hit, does the arrow damage increase i.e. the later we hit Q the more damage it is?
