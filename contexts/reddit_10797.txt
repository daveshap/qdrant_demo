It’s just sad because the only thing I see in my future is eventually killing myself.
I am just imagining doing it now. It sounds so nice, peaceful. I just want things to be quiet. Somewhere beautiful. 


I won’t kill myself today, and not tomorrow.
I know that killing myself means hurting my family. I’ve seen how suicides affect people. 


But I’m in so much pain. I’m 4 days clean from cutting. The mental and physical pain are so much sometimes.

Anytime I’m feeling something other than sadness or depression I know it will fade.
I feel like i see the world for what it is when I’m depressed. I’m more creative when I can think.


Idk I’m just kind of ranting.
You guys don’t need to send me to someone to talk. I’m okay. Today’s my first day of being on a new antidepressant so eventually I will get better.
I am seeing a psychologist though I think I need to talk more often to them.
