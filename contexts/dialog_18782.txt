ZACH: Aren't you going to switch exits on him again ?
JOHNNY: Why ? The crocks are all going for the dead crock. There's no fun in it. Besides we've got plenty more for them. The night is young....
MATTHEW: What's next Walt ?
BRUCE: A dragon.
MATTHEW: So what happened ? Did you have a real bad theme park experience as a kid and this is your revenge ?
BRUCE: Be very, very quiet...
MATTHEW: Are you hunting wabbits ?
BRUCE: The room has sound sensors. If you wake it up, it breathes fire.
MATTHEW: You were one of those guys that played Dungeons & Dragons with real swords, weren't you.
