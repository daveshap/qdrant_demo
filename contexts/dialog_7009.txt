PETER: I knew you wouldn't kill me.
FRIDA: Maybe we should have children. I don't think I'd kill the father of my child.
PETER: We can work this out. Other couples have worse problems.
FRIDA: Worse than this?
PETER: Sure. Cheating, lying. What's a little werewolf a few days a month? We can move out to the country where you can feed off deer.
FRIDA: What about... those guys... I might have...
PETER: No way can anything be proved. All they have are some wolf hairs. No one believes in werewolves.
FRIDA: I'm so sorry... I... I couldn't help it. You know I didn't mean to... to do any of that.
PETER: I know. The important thing is that it stop.
