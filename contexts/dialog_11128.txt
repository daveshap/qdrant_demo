CLAY: You ever been married, Hanna?
HANNA: Of course. I am married still.
CLAY: Yeah? What's your husband do?
HANNA: He is dead now, twenty years.
CLAY: Then you're as single as I am.
HANNA: No. I have children, grandchildren too. I visit when I can. But now that Mr. Jimmy cannot be left very long, I do not get away much. Poor Mr. Jimmy. There is much good in him, but he will suffer the fires of hell. Very sad.
CLAY: You're sure of that?
HANNA: This is what the priests tell me. His sins of the flesh will keep him from heaven.
CLAY: Sins of the flesh? Everybody has those.
HANNA: No. His is the worse. The unspeakable. The deed no man can name without shame?
HANNA: What is the good English? All I know is bugger. He is a bugger. Men who bugger each other.
CLAY: A homo?
HANNA: Yes! You know?
HANNA: That is why he must go to hell. I do not think it fair. But God's law is not for us to judge.
CLAY: You're telling me Mr. Whale is a homo.
HANNA: You did not know?
CLAY: Well...no, not really --
HANNA: You and he are not doing things?
CLAY: No!
HANNA: Good. That is what I hope. I did not think you a bugger too. I fear only that you might hurt him if he tries.
CLAY: I'm not going to hurt anyone.
HANNA: Yes. I trust you.
