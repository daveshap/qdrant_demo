PSA to everyone who may be evicted by their university housing or off-campus housing due to the coronavirus outbreak!
I'm a Crisis Counselor at the Crisis Text Line. You don't have to just use it if you're feeling suicidal. You can use it if you're feeling anxious or depressed about the coronavirus outbreak or any other issue. Feel free to vent out your frustrations and emotions but please know that we're not the experts in your life. Text STEVE to 741741 if you prefer to be with a Crisis Counselor of color.

I'll be on the Crisis Text Line platform starting from 8 PM Eastern Time and I'll probably be on for around four hours.

Regardless of who you get, please leave us crisis counselors some feedback regarding our help and services overall. Please tell us what we can be doing better and what we've been doing well. 

Thanks!
