NAZEER: Yeah. Yeah, it's okay for you. It's okay. Enjoy yourself.
BUFF: Are you talking to me?
NAZEER: It's okay.
BUFF: Glad it's okay.
NAZEER: I'll tell you what. When I get my engineering degree and I'm swimming in my swimming pool, it will be very fucking okay.
BUFF: Um, if you're talking to me, could you make some sense? 'Cause I don't speak Swahili.
NAZEER: In two more years I'll have an engineering degree. We'll sell the store, we'll move away from Burnfield and the store and you standing here.
BUFF: Good. See you later.
NAZEER: You're a drunk and an idiot.
BUFF: You're wife sucks my cock every night, swallows my cum and loves it. That's okay.
NAZEER: Yeah it's okay. You know, we have a saying back home: Either the salt is rotten or the meat.""
BUFF: Yeah, well, uh, you're not so smart, chief, 'cause I'm moving out to L.A.
NAZEER: Ah, that's nice. They have many convenience stores there for you to stand in front of.
BUFF: Yeah. Get ahold of Sooze?
JEFF: No, no, I wasn't trying.
BUFF: She was at the Four Seasons last night, man. But you shouldn't worry about that.
JEFF: No, I'm not, I'm not worried. I'm not worried.
BUFF: No. Life is too short.
JEFF: No, I'm not worried.
BUFF: Good.
JEFF: Uh, Buff, I'm, I'm, gonna tell you something and, uh, you got, you got, you gotta promise not to tell anyone, alright?
BUFF: Sure.
JEFF: No, I mean, no one.
BUFF: Hey, you know me.
JEFF: Buff, look at me for a second. No, this is serious.
BUFF: Yeah.
JEFF: Uh, last night...
BUFF: Yeah, I should've stuck up for you, man, I know. You're my friend, she's your old lady.
JEFF: No, no.
BUFF: I feel really bad about that, but I was busy, you know, I mean...
JEFF: No, look, this is not about Sooze, alright. Wait, wait, wait, wait. She stayed at the Four Seasons last night with Pony?
BUFF: Yeah, we all stayed at the Four Seasons, man. It was party time. Hey, I hung out with Danny, Pony's manager. Really nice guy. We talked about the video. They want a raw look. Something fresh. Danny said if I can capture the reality of Burnfield, it'd make a great tape.
JEFF: Okay, Buff, listen to me for a second alright?
BUFF: No, I know what you're going to say. I don't know anything about making a video. But that's a plus.
JEFF: No.
BUFF: Because since I'm just starting out, I've got a fresh point of view, and that's good for, you know, marketing, demographics...
JEFF: Buff, listen to me. Could you just-
BUFF: But I'd, I'd do it for free. You know, just for my reel.
JEFF: Buff, can you listen to me for a second?
BUFF: Oh, and guess who showed up.
JEFF: No, shut up! Look, look, alright, Tim is in trouble.
BUFF: I know, man.
JEFF: You know?
BUFF: Yeah, that's what I'm trying to tell you. That chick Erica?
JEFF: What, they're looking for her?
BUFF: No man, she showed up last night at the hotel. We has a great time together. I stayed in her room last night, man. What can I say?
JEFF: Wait a minute, wait a minute. You saw Erica last night?
BUFF: Yeah, I saw all of Erica last night, man.
JEFF: Buff, you got to stop making shit up. It didn't happen.
BUFF: Y- s-sure it did.
JEFF: No. It didn't, Buff.
BUFF: Wait. Hey, man.
JEFF: Erica is in the van back there.
BUFF: What?
JEFF: Look.
BUFF: Hey, man.
JEFF: She's in the van.
BUFF: What she doin' in the van, man?
JEFF: Buff...
BUFF: What?
JEFF: She's dead.
BUFF: She's dead?
JEFF: Look, Tim confessed to me last night.
BUFF: Tim...
JEFF: Tim killed Erica. Tim's a murderer.
BUFF: Bullshit.
JEFF: No, no, no.
BUFF: That's bullshit. That's total utter bullshit.
JEFF: Oh, really? You wanna go look?
BUFF: Yeah, man.
JEFF: Let's go look, then. Let's go look, then!
BUFF: It's bullshit. Look! Look!
