Loving you has made me hate myself.
You brokeup with me once and I wish it ended there. You knew my darkness but only decided you wanted to be with me when you saw I was moving on. You told me you were insecure and afraid you'd be disappointing. I assured you and tried so hard to rebuild what we were.

I have never misrepresented myself and I haven't changed. Maybe you decided to settle for less because perfect hadn't come along. You could be satisfied with a half hearted love because it's better than being alone.

I know my flaws. I'm short and chubby. I have stretch marks. My hair is starting to grey. I don't look like Kelly Brook or Anna Songs but before I though I still had value. I thought it was possible to be pretty without being perfect.

You haven't given me a compliment in years. You never touch me, even in the rare cases when we're having sex. But you're more satisfied with porn then having sex with me anyway. 

I feel like your maid and your chef but not like a woman you're proud to be with. When we're in public you often walk away from me leaving me running to catch up. You say you can't walk slow, I just feel you don't want to be seen with me.

I have forgotten how to see myself. I'm always looking through a warped funhouse mirror that only shows my flaws. For the past six months I've just wanted to peel my skin off and pour acid on myself until I melt into nothingness. 

I hate me for ever loving you.

Seriously thanks for the downvotes with no comments. I honestly don't know why I expected to find support anywhere.
