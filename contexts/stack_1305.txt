Is replacing the nails with gasketed screws likely to remedy leaks in a metal shed roof? I own a 40 year old shed with a steel roof that was fastened using gasketed nails. Over time the nails have worked loose and the gaskets disintegrated and many of the holes leak. Will pulling them and replacing them in the same holes with screws designed for the job resolve the leaks, or at least most of them?
