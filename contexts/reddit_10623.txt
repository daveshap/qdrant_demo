It’s so sad seeing how many people want to die
It’s so sad seeing so many people post “Well today is the day” and “Goodbye, I’m doing it tonight” like so many people struggle with this thoughts and its something that happens per minute. If this sub only has 120k and so many peoples lives are so problematic that they’d rather just disappear from the world makes me wonder how many people attempt or kill  themselves daily worldwide...

I don’t think the average persons aware of how many people struggle with this issue. Most people who have suicidal thoughts keep it a secret it’s weird and tragic knowing that person sitting next to you is probably the last time you’ll see them again...

Ps: I’m also thankful for this sub like were all in our own little world together where we share our deepest secrets and that there’s people who can actually understand what I’m going through. Feels nice.
