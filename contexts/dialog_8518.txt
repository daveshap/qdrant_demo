RIEEKAN: Captain Solo. What's the situation?
HAN: There isn't a hint of life in the area. But all the perimeter markers are set, so you'll know if anyone comes calling.
RIEEKAN: Good, and Commander Skywalker?
HAN: He's checking out a meteorite that hit near him. He'll be in soon.
RIEEKAN: With all the meteor activity in this system, it's going to be difficult to spot approaching ships.
HAN: The Empire won't look for you out here. I'd say you're all set ... which means it's time for me to get going.
