Edit and transform XML/GML files I'm searching for an approach as someone who just started to work with geodata recently. It's about the following situation: I received several XML files. I need to perform a geometric difference task between 2 objects, and export it afterwards to XML or GML again. Using QGIS doesn't seem to work here as for no proper export, also for having no automation when the same tasks need to be repeated for new source data. I read about the GDAL library and PostGIS database, I can just make a guess that this is what I'm looking for, I cannot really say it for sure as I'm not able to overlook it all. Can someone tell me if this is what I'm looking for and give general steps on how to proceed?
