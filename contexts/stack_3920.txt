Autocorrelation in a predictor variable Suppose that my main purpose is to model (using GLM e.g.) an annual count data by using two predictors one of which is mean annual water level measurement which, in itself, is auto-correlated (i.e. one year's measurement is affected by previous year's measurement). What should I do then? I know what to do when my response variable violates the assumption of independence but what about predictor variables? Should I do something?
