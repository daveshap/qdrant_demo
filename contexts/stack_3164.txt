Do starship captains typically recite mission-specific oaths, as at the end of Star Trek Into Darkness? At the end of Star Trek Into Darkness, Captian Kirk is speaking to a large group of people (perhaps a service for the recently-deceased Captain Pike?). He says the following:<blockquote>  When Christopher Pike  first gave me his ship, he had me recite the Captain's Oath, words I didn't appreciate at the time. Now I see them as a call  for us to remember who we once were, and who we must be again.    Those words?    Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the starship Enterprise. Her five-year mission, to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no one has gone before.</blockquote>It seems absolutely absurd that the \"tv show intro\" would actually be used as any type of official \"oath\" for Starfleet captains.Was this \"captain's oath\" concept totally invented to make the end of the movie more appealing to fans of the original series?If not, and it's an actual oath:Were the parts about the \"USS Enterprise\" and the \"five-year mission\" some kind of fill-in-the-blank parts of the oath? They obviously wouldn't apply to other ships with different missions.Or was this some kind of Enterprise-specific oath? Perhaps something that Pike had recited for his predecessor when he took command of the Enterprise?
