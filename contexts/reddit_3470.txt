Just got kissed for the first time in eight years (30M)
Wow.

So earlier this week I met up with someone my age from an online dating website. We walked around town, had dinner and a few drinks together. It seemed to be going well, and she’s really amazing and beautiful, but being the skinny, insecure nerd that I am (never been in a relationship, never had sex) I had no idea if she liked me romantically or not.

In a random burst of confidence which happens very rarely to me, as we were laughing and talking together near the end of the evening, I out of the blue asked if I could kiss her. She said yes. Before I could process this, she moved up close to me and we made out for a good few minutes.

She was the first person to kiss me since the beginning of 2011, when I was 22. I’m now 30. No one I had met in the last eight years had made the move on me, and everyone I had asked (which might sound lame to some but I’ve always been cautious) had all gently said no. I started online dating a year and a half ago when I had enough of being alone, but I hadn’t had much success until now. I didn’t tell her how long it had been, I just said after she was the first in a long time. To which she smiled, understood, and kissed me even more.

I feel pretty incredible about it still. We both lead busy lives but I hope we find time soon to see each other again. And, whatever happens, I *really* hope it’s not another eight years until the next time.

What’s the next step for me, and how can I keep this new-found confidence/self-worth going?
