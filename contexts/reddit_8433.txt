What are the process and limits of the presidential pardon, in light of Michael Flynn's lawyer stating it is "An under-utilized tool of political power."
I just found out last night [Flynn's lawyer](http://www.cnn.com/2017/03/30/politics/michael-flynn-immunity-testimony/index.html) Robert Kelner [tweeted](https://twitter.com/robkelner/status/797655334454259713) this only a few days after the Nov 2016 election:

> A prediction: Donald Trump will make novel and unusual use of the President's pardon power. An under-utilized tool of political power.

Can the president pardon anyone for any reason? Can it be done multiple times for the same person, or different people relating to the same issue? Does someone have to be convicted for the pardon, or can it follow simply after formal charges are made?

I actually have many more interests on this topic I'll save for discussion. I think that's enough to get started.
