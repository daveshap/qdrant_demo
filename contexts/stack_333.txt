Apple Maps: Renaming Favorires or Marked Locations There must be some really obvious trick which has escaped me.If I favorite a marked location on MacOS Maps, or on iOS Maps, I can\u2019t see how I can give it a custom name.Tapping or clicking on Info doesn\u2019t seem to help, and I can\u2019t see any other method.I have tried the technique of selecting favorites from the search bar (in MacOS), selecting edit and trying, but the text remains uneditable.I would even consider a third party app if there is one.I am using MacOS Mojave, and iOS 12.
