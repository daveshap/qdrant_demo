Show current desktop (workspace) in taskbar I currently use Compiz Desktop Wall to move between workspaces, but occasionally I lose my orientation when something automatically moves me to another workspace or I come back to my computer after leaving.  Is it possible to label workspaces so that the current workspace I'm in shows somewhere on the taskbar?  Either with text or an icon showing where on the wall I'm at would be great.  Does something like this exist?
