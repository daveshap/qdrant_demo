CHIEF CLERK: I understand you fancy yourself an author.
KAFKA: In a small way.
CHIEF CLERK: You might find a more athletic hobby -- put some color in your cheeks.
BURGEL: Good morning -- Or should I say good afternoon?
GABRIELA: Say what you like -- no one pays the least attention.
BURGEL: Oh, don't they? I think you underestimate my station in this office and overrate your own.
GABRIELA: Not today, Burgel. Send one of your memos, write up one of your communiques, but for God's sake don't bother me today.
BURGEL: It's my place to offer advice, not yours -- and by advising the Chief Clerk of your unpunctuality it's certainly not my situation that's compromised, if that's what you're implying.
GABRIELA: You're just doing your job.
BURGEL: It's what I'm paid to do.
GABRIELA: You're detestable.
BURGEL: And you're late!
KAFKA: My assistants, I presume.
ASSISTANTS: Yes -- that's us.
