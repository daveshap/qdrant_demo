SHERIFF: Maybe you should be moving on.
DUKE: Maybe you should mind your own business.
SHERIFF: Get up!
DUKE: Why don't you blow me, Chief. After your girlfriend gets through.
SHERIFF: You're talking about my lady.
DUKE: She's your lady only cause she ain't had a taste of the Duke yet.
SHERIFF: Goddamnit!
DUKE: Careful, Chief. I don't think you know who I am.
SHERIFF: I know who you are and the last thing we need around here is some freak show bounty hunter" making trouble. I want you outta town and I want you outta town now!"
DUKE: That's very colorful, chief.
SHERIFF: Take him to my car. I'll be out in a minute.
