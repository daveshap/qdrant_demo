it is my bday and nobody remembered
It is 2 am and nobody celebrated my bday except my mom and two of her friends and it is my sweet 16. I know it is not even morning yet and this sounds lame but my snap streaks can see its my bday because a cake appears next to my name. I know this is not a big problem I am not sad just because of this I am sad because the people I care about so much doesnt care about me, I saw this through years. I feel lonely, I feel very depressed and I feel like if people really try to get to know me better they will like me. Also, I am 16 now and I still haven't had my first kiss. Is this bad? How can I socialize more and be more extrovert? Can you give me some advice I really do feel alone.
