I introduced myself to my class today without my voice shaking. I call that a real victory. ðŸ˜„
Itâ€™s the worst week ever at university. Syllabus week. The week where everyone has to introduce themselves. I had to do it twice and each time my voice didnâ€™t shake when usually it does. This is such a big deal for me. Cause Iâ€™m always embarrassed by how my voice shakes at first when introducing myself to others or talking in front of a large group.
