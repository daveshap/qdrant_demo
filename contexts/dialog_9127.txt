VICTOR: Same old Reed. All analysis, no action. Wasn't that the problem with you two?
SUE: If these molecules aren't stable, they could make us worse, maybe even kill us.
VICTOR: Then why is Reed dragging his feet? Maybe he likes having his prize specimen under glass... It's ironic, isn't it? You're finally the perfect woman for him... because you're his science project.
SUE: Please don't make this personal --
VICTOR: Oh, I think you already have.
SUE: Victor, we can't do anything until the research is ready.
