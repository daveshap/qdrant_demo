New type of policing might mean new types of police jobs?
I thought I would ask if anyone else thinks police departments might, in the future, hire officers at different levels of training for different levels of service.  Not every call requires officers with guns to show up.  Bank robberies, shootings, gang related calls, yes the officers with guns need to go.  But, medical emergencies, auto accidents, truancy, health and welfare checks do not require an armed response. 

Maybe there are opportunities with police and sheriff departments for people with different skill sets and training.
