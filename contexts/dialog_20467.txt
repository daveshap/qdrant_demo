MEG: Okay, listen, honey, you went double digit here, you must have been shooting out adrenaline like crazy, we gotta bring your blood sugar back up, okay? Can you hear me?
SARAH: I'm dizzy, not deaf.
MEG: Hey, she's still a smart ass, excellent sign. Did you see any sugar in here? Any candy bars, anything sweet?
SARAH: Huh uh.
MEG: Okay, you just gotta calm yourself down, that's all, just stay calm and your adrenaline will go back to normal and you'll be fine.
SARAH: What if I keep dropping?
MEG: Not an option.
SARAH: What if I do?
JUNIOR: We're leaving.
RAOUL: The hell we are.
BURNHAM: Hey man, after all we went through I am not walking out when we're this close.
JUNIOR: Close? Are you insane? We're nowhere near close! Fuck this, I'll make an anonymous phone call on Monday, they'll find the floor safe, and I'll inherit the shit. Little piece of it, anyway, it's better than nothing.
BURNHAM: What about us?
