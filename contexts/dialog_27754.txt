ALEX: Sssshhh. She's resting.
TOMMY: Where the fuck did you come from?
ALEX: Big bang, primordial ooze, divine hand of a benevolent creator? All possibilities. Although recent events have given me doubts about the benevolent creator.
ALEX: You lied at my trial.

ALEX: Capital case nine nine dash C one one five. Alex Corvis. Exhibit A.
TOMMY: Hey. I said what I saw. Two kids arguing. A guy and a girl.
ALEX: You said you saw me with this. I never held it until today.

ALEX: Wrong. Answer.
TOMMY: Who are you?
