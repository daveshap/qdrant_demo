I'm graduating from high school and I have no clue what I want to do. Do you guys have any suggestions based on what I tell you?
Hey! So I have a lot of different interests. I also suck at commitment, so going to school for one specific career kind of scares me. Over the years, my career interests have included neuropsychologist, occupational therapist, art professor, physicist, and freelance artist. I love art, but I am also really good at math, and space fascinates me. The thing is, I hate doing math, even though I'm really good at it. I know that most careers involving space have a lot to do with math and physics, but I was looking into some involving the more biological side of astronomy (planets, life in space, etc.). I also really love art, but I know that that can be a difficult career path to pursue.

Anyway, I'm just looking for suggestions in careers/degrees that would be fun for someone who loves art and space, is good at math but hates it, and is super bad at committing to one type of work. Time feels like it is running low, and I'm freaking out a little cause if I want to start university next September I have to apply and be accepted to the school I want before December.

Any and all suggestions are really appreciated!
