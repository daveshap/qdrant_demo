Phone screen follow up?
Hi all, 

Had a phone interview/screen not last Friday but the Friday before and haven’t heard anything back from the recruiter. The recruiter didn’t give me any concrete dates or timelines for next steps, just outlined what the next steps were and that she’d flag my profile for both hiring managers/teams and go from there. I know with COVID19 a lot of things are on hold but it’s also a tech company. Thoughts? When is it okay to reach out?
