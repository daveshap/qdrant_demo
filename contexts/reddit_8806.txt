What is typically contained within internal campaign polling? Would that have been valuable to the efforts described in the indictments of Russian government officials for interfering in the 2016 elections?
Yesterday in a court filing with [a major failure in redaction](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/legal-issues/paul-manafort-shared-2016-polling-data-with-russian-employee-according-to-court-filing/2019/01/08/3f562ad8-12b0-11e9-803c-4ef28312c8b9_story.html) it was revealed that during the 2016 campaign, then Trump campaign Chairman Paul Manafort shared internal campaign polling with [Konstantin Kilimnick,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Konstantin_Kilimnik) with whom he had also discussed giving briefings to [Oleg Derpiaska](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oleg_Deripaska) a prominent Russian businessman with close ties to Vladimir Putin, about whom there is a controversy over the continuation of [sanctions.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/house-democrats-demand-treasury-explain-rollback-of-sanctions-on-russia-oligarch/2019/01/08/80285642-138e-11e9-b6ad-9cfd62dbb0a8_story.html)

Edit to add: since I posted this, [new reports have come out](https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/09/politics/manafort-ukrainian-oligarchs/index.html) that Manafort intended the data to go to two pro-Russian Ukranian oligarchs, Serhiy Lyovochkin and Rinat Akhmetov, and that Manafort expected contemporaneous payments from them of about $2.4 million.  Manafort denies the payments were related.

My question about this is what information would typically be seen in internal campaign polling?  Do they usually contain things which you wouldn't see in public polling such as [message testing](https://yougov.co.uk/topics/politics/articles-reports/2011/05/16/message-testing-v-push-polling) or other information designed to target media purchases or campaign activities?  What sort of information might be included?  Would any of it [have been useful or used by the Russian "Internet Research Agency" troll farms which were alleged to be heavily involved in campaigning for Trump and against Hillary Clinton?](https://www.justice.gov/file/1035477/download)
