How much notice do I need to give my current employer if I've been here for 6 years and my work is is very specialized?
Hi!

Basically, I've been working for my current company for about 6 years now. It's the only professional job I've ever had and I've steadily moved up from financial analyst to VP. My boss is the CFO and he's very absent. I probably have talked to him four times this year. I heard that my company was closing it's doors through the grapevine, and I confronted my boss about it and he confirmed it was true. He told me I had 6-18 months (\*scratches head\*). He told me that he supports me wanting to leave but needed appropriate notice. He didn't specify what this was. My workload is either crazy stressful or non-existent. Has mostly been non-existent for the past couple year. To keep me around, I have a high salary and position title because they need me for this model I built that nobody else knows how to operate, but that's about it.

Anyways, I've been following this new company for 6 months and a job opened up that I thought I'd be a good fit for. Same pay, better benefits, same location...new coworkers lol. Nervous about it but I think that I'm finally ready to leave and start learning again. I passed the first interview and the excel test and have the final interview this Thursday. So my question is this: how much notice do I need to give my boss? My only motivation for this is that I want my annual bonus which I would receive in February. I think it's plausible I would receive this because my company laid off a bunch of people in August and gave them three months notice and also the bonus they would have received in 2020. I think that is generous of them. I know that I'll have to train somebody on how to use my model, though it also occurred to me that they might keep me on as a contractor? Has anybody ever seen this before? Also for this new job, do you think I need to be completely transparent that I haven't spoken to my current employer about leaving? I am worried my current position will need me to stay a month and that will be too long for the new job. Am I just being too anxious about this switch?

UPDATE: I am in the US, and I have a final final interview this Friday with the new company. I appreciate all the feedback - you guys are so helpful! If I get the job, I am going to wait until I have an offer letter, and then I am going to tell my boss that I am willing to do whatever it takes to ensure my workload is covered by an existing employee. And then ask for a severance package similar to the people they laid off. Truthfully, my boss is a really nice guy and I think he might be willing to give me my bonus in exchange for ensuring all of my reporting etc is taken care of. My fingers are crossed for this one. Your input was so helpful!
