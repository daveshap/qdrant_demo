JACK: So what'd we get her?
FRANK: You'll see.
MRS. BAKER: Well, if it isn't the fabulous Baker Boys!
FRANK: How's the birthday girl?
MRS. BAKER: A little stiffer, but just as sturdy.
MRS. BAKER: John. It's good to see you.
JACK: Good to see you, Ma.
FRANK: Uh, Ma, you know, no one calls him that anymore. Jack. He goes by Jack.
MRS. BAKER: I thought maybe held gotten over that.
FRANK: Twenty years, Ma ...
MRS. BAKER: Yes, yes. It's just that John is so much nicer. Jack sounds so ... crude. When I was a little girl, we had a pig on the farm named Jack. I guess I just can't help making the association.
FRANK: Uh ... yeah, well, you know, Ma, John Kennedy went by Jack.
