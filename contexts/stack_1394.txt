How is differential signalling AC? My initial understanding was that each differential signal (such as those used for encoders, e.g. A and inverse of A) travels along its own line and is unconnected to its inverse, etc.However, I've been informed that differential signalling is actually AC, where the signal's inverse line effectively completes the circuit.Could somebody explain exactly how differential signalling is handled, what happens in the wire, etc?
