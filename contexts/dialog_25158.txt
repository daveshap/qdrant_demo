KHAN: Kirk! Kirk, you are still alive -- my old friend...
KIRK: Still, 'old friend.' You've managed to kill just about everyone else, but like a poor marksman, you keep missing the target.
KHAN: Perhaps I no longer need to try.
DAVID: Let go -- he can't -- !
SAAVIK: Only half of you would get there.
