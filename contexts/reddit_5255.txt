I got suspended from work for breaking a company policy. Need some advice for moving forward.
I work at a restaurant in CA and I got called into the office by my store manager and I talked to HR on the phone. I was told I was going to be put on suspension for now, until they figure out what I did wrong or further ‘investigate’ the situation. I broke a company policy. (I didn’t think it was as serious as it is. I definitely know now that they don’t mess around.) I took a picture of the “backroom” and posted it on social media with a caption that they (corporate) didn’t like. (Its a long story on how they found out it was me. And there’s a lot of inside information that would take way to long to explain.)

I talked to HR and told them “yes, i did take that photo yada yada yada...” (I would never lie to anyone at my job, that would just get me in more trouble) and they told me i was gonna be on work suspension. I seriously am freaking out cuz Ive worked there for a long time and I’m a hard worker and well respected by everyone. I really don’t want to lose my job and my store manager certainly doesn’t want to have to fire me, but the call isn’t on her. Corporate are making the call, my store manager told me she has no say in it or any influence over the decision they make. 

I honestly cant believe how dumb i am to post something so stupid online... it was literally a meme too... what is wrong with me... Im pretty sure im getting fired... like 100%, if corporate is making the decision then yeah...

My question is, what do any of you guys think? Will I get fired for something minor like taking a freaking picture? Any advice or input about my situation? Will I be able to get another job? (thats what Im most worried about.)
