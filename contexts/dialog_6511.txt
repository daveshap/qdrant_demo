HELEN: Is it an ongoing case?
M.J.: For months... last October.
HELEN: It was a lover or a husband. Someone close. Somebody who knew her and cared about her.
M.J.: How do you know that?
HELEN: He felt remorse. He covered her.
HELEN: The bodies have been carefully arranged... different positions, but somehow the same. The positions are brutal... yet quite... artful. It's like... a signature. He's proud of his accomplishments. There are early Picassos and late Picassos, but you always recognize the hand. He wants us to recognize <u>his</u> hand. I've seen this hand before... what are you hiding?
M.J.: Nothing.
HELEN: Where are the stockings he strangled them with?
M.J.: How did you know they were stockings?
HELEN: I sent Andy out on murder missions. For God's sake -- it's the Boston Strangler, Alber deSalvo. He used their own stockings to strangle them. Tied in a bow-knot.
HELEN: Somebody is imitating his m.o. Look for a plumber or carpenter or handyman; that's how deSalvo got in the door and caught them off guard.
RUBEN: The Boston Strangler, when was that...?
HELEN: In the sixties. He's dead -- stabbed to death in prison.
M.J.: Why imitate a dead serial killer?
HELEN: If you knew why, you might know where to look for him. I don't envy you this; he's not done -- he's going to do them faster and faster to keep the adrenaline rush. Now, I've done what you asked me.
M.J.: Work with me.
