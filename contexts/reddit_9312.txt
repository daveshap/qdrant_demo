I work in retail. My hours for this week, every single one, was cut thanks to Coronavirus, and I have less than $100 to my name.
Best thing is? My boss said she'd contact me to tell me if I am even coming in next week. So, no money for TWO WHOLE WEEKS, no paycheck coming in from ANYWHERE, and roughly $75.00 to my name.

I'm F U C K E D

**Edit:** It should have been *were* cut. Sorry, that was bugging me. 

**Edit:** Thanks for all the awesome replies! Stay safe, everyone (:
