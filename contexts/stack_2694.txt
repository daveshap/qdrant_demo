GeoWebCache Internals I want to integrate GeoWebCache with GeoServer.If a request( with a bbox say bbox-A) is cached in GWC.Next,if a different user sends another request with a [bbox-A +- 0.00000001], will the cache be able to provide?I believe that OpenLayers divides the screen area into a matrix (defined by image height, width) and makes a WMS request for each cell. Each request has a bbox parameter.If the GWC is seeded with a much larger area, It internally will be saving the tiles with a different bboxes.If there is a delta between the bbox of GWC and the request, will GWC be totally missed ?
