What are the pros and cons of privatizing Air Traffic Control in the United States?
The latest announcement is that Trump wants to start [privatizing air traffic control](http://www.npr.org/2017/06/05/531574945/trump-announces-plan-to-privatize-air-traffic-control?utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=politics&utm_medium=social&utm_term=nprnews).

For reference, it appears that Canada has privatized their air traffic control systems and Trump is using their success as a guideline. 

So I have 3 questions:

1. What are the pros

2. What are the cons

3. What has been the result of Canada privatizing their system, and is it valid to use them as a comparison?
