At what point in dating does the moment strike a guy that makes them think "I want her to be my GF"?
Really interested in the male perspective here. What goes on in your head when you decide that you want to go from just dating to a full-blown relationship? Do you have Pinnacle moments with her that make you realize or is it just like a switch that gets flipped?
