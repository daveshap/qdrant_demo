Just published my first book, How to Write the Perfect Resume, free on Amazon. Check it out!
Hey everyone,

A couple years ago I decided that I wanted to steer my career in a direction where I’d eventually be working for myself full time, and although I’m nowhere near close to that point yet, I’m really excited about this first fruit of my efforts.  A little background on me: graduated ten years ago, live in the Bay Area, and have worked at some of the more notable tech companies here in SV.  Due to the decent success I’ve had on the job front, I’ve always been the “go to” guy in my circle of friends and family members for resume help and general career advice, and I had never really thought much about this until I had the idea that I could turn it into a full\-blown career.  The idea stuck with me and one day, I just started writing and continued doing so pretty much every day since for the past couple years.  This week, I’m proud to say that my efforts have finally culminated in a real, tangible product that I think \(hope\) is ready for the world to see.

For this first book, I took everything I knew about how to write a great resume and condensed it down into a comprehensive, step\-by\-step guide that anyone can use to shape their resume in a way that will truly capture the attention of potential employers.  There’s a lot of advice out there\-\-some of it good, some of it bad\-\-and I wanted to put my own spin on what’s worked for me and the others who I’ve helped land their target jobs.  The end result is something I hope can truly help people avoid the mistakes that land their resumes in the dreaded black hole and get them one step closer to finding a meaningful, fulfilling career path.

Anyways, the book is available for free on Amazon Kindle through June 8th, so be sure to get your copy before the price goes up.
