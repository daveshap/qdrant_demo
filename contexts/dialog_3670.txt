CHARLIE: ... Nick, you're the one that's always saying you never go anywhere.
NICK: I was thinking the Poconos, Charlie. Maybe Vegas.
CHARLIE: What are you missing? Riding your motorcycle to the nurse's house. That shit is sadder than Ethiopia.
NICK: Beats forty hours on a plane.
CHARLIE: They say we got to turn around and come right back. That's what they say. I got a plan.
CHARLIE: I call, right? I say I got the dreaded thirty six-hour Asian shits from some raw clam and we stretch it into three days. You and I become a driving force on the local Geisha scene.
NICK: Not a prayer.
CHARLIE: Hey, come on, big guy like you, cop from New York. You're gonna be the biggest thing to hit town since Godzilla.
