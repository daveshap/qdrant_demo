ERIC: Know what this is?
GRANT: A raptor claw. I use to have one. A fossil.
ERIC: Mine's new.
GRANT: How much of this island have you explored?
ERIC: I stayed pretty close to the compound, Figured if anyone came to look for me, that's where they'd start.
GRANT: We need to head for the coast.
ERIC: Are you sure?
GRANT: Why?
ERIC: Closer you get to the water, the bigger things get.
BILLY: We need to stick to the plan. Head for the coast.
AMANDA: What about Eric and Dr. Grant?
BILLY: Going to the coast was Alan's idea. If he's alive, thatâ€™s where he's headed.
AMANDA: What about Eric?
PAUL: He's probably has a better chance by the coast as it is. Figures that all the big dinosaurs would live in the center of the island. Right?
BILLY: Sure.
