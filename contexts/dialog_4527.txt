MR. HENRY: I'll tell you, Anthony. Times like this I get philosophical. What does it mean? What's it all about? Are you afraid to die?
ANTHONY: Me?
MR. HENRY: No, that door over there.
ANTHONY: I don't want to die.
MR. HENRY: Are you afraid?
ANTHONY: Yeah. I mean, I don't think about it all the time. But once in awhile I kind of go, Woah. Man.
MR. HENRY: Exactly. Woah.
ANTHONY: Death.
MR. HENRY: The fear of death, The pain of consciousness. Did you mix this martini?
ANTHONY: No. Bob did.
MR. HENRY: Bob. Bob. That's a palindrome. I love palindromes.
ANTHONY: Are you afraid to die, Mr. Henry?
MR. HENRY: Anthony, I'm petrified.
