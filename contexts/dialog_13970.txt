WRIGLEY: I tried to reach Ruth, but we couldn't get her.
MILES: We wanted Ruth here for your protection as well --
WRIGLEY: The Judge is here. Over here, Judge Munson.
MARYLIN: Wasn't she the Judge at my divorce hearing?
MILES: Yes. Short notice you know, but I think there's nice closure to it. Hello Judge Muson. A pleasure as always.
