"Are you willing to relocate?" = "Do you mind if I ghost you forever?"
Since we don't have the Megathreads anymore, I'll just start posting my short disappointments in my own topics, I guess.

On the 24th, a recruiter contacted me and said "I saw you applied for the C++ programmer position. When are you free to discuss some details?"

I said "I'm available most of the day, between about noon and midnight, so feel free to call whenever it suits your schedule."

They replied "Perfect, I will email you in a few hours to setup [sic] a call. Are you in Austin?"

I said no, and they asked "Are you willing to relocate?" and I said yes, of course, "I can move at any time."

The end.

(Yeah, it seems like there should be more to this story, like the part where we actually have the phone conversation *he* contacted *me* about, but there isn't. He never got back to me after that)
