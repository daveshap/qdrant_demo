Does anyone feel like your anxiety has made you less intelligent?
I want to say those with anxiety are naturally intelligent people , we tend to be vivid thinkers,  over analytical and creative.

I've had anxiety disorder about  6 years (it's getting a little better) but I feel like it's messed up my brain. I can't think clear, I don't have interest in things like I used to, i have zero motivation to  care and many things are overwhelming.

I feel like it's hard for me to comprehend what others are saying and I don't have anything important to say. Hell, I don't even know how to "act" around people anymore other than my few close friends and fiance.  
My brain is always on , it's exhausting. I obsess about the things that bother me, yet too scared to change them.

Has anyone experienced this and did you do anything to improve it? Sorry if this was long and "venty" I just feel trapped in my head! *Takes brain out and throws it out the window* 

Thank you :-)

Edit: wow thank you everyone for all of your comments. It means a lot that we can share and relate here, to know we are not alone on this.
