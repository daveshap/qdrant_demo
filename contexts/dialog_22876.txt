SARGE: You ever going to open those letters? Miller keeps his eyes on the maps.
MILLER: Maybe.
SARGE: It's not normal, not reading letters from home.
MILLER: Since when have things been normal?
SARGE: You got me. Afraid of bad news?
MILLER: Nope.
SARGE: Good news?
SARGE: You think they'll be alright?
MILLER: They're fine. As long as they can gripe, they'll be alright.
SARGE: And what about you?
MILLER: They guys here aren't going to be able to hold out until battalion shows up.
SARGE: Nope.
MILLER: Command isn't going to let them withdraw and the Germans sure as hell aren't going to let them surrender.
SARGE: Three for three.
MILLER: If we stayed, we could make a difference.
SARGE: You're kidding yourself.
MILLER: You never know.
SARGE: I hope this boy Ryan is worth it.
MILLER: Now you're the one kidding yourself. Hell of a mission.
SARGE: Yup, hell of a mission.
