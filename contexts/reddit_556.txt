low self esteem?
I don’t know what to do with the rest of my life. I’m 16 years old sophomore in high school, c average student, no interests, and no skills. Not really good at anything really. Grades aren’t that good and I’m probably not going to go to college. Not very attractive and overweight. My friends say I just have a low self esteem.  Don’t know what I’m going to do for the rest of my life. Advice?
