Preparing for an Interview
I would like to ask for any recommendation or advice from you. I have an interview in two weeks for an advisor position at an institution that I currently work at. The minimum requirement for the job is Bachelor's with 3 years of advising experience and preferred is Masters.

I have my bachelor's and am working on my masters; however, no advising experience. I have cross-trained at that office in the past and know the office and full-time and student employees really well since we are all in the same department. I have written in my cover letter that I have been studying responsibilities and policies relating to the position since cross-training at the office to be more qualified.

I feel that I am getting an interview because 1. they know me and 2. I have talked to the dean of the department and discussed my concern about not getting an interview (the HR apparently rejected my application because I don't meet that three-year advising experience). Whatever the case is, I am very grateful to have this opportunity to do my best and show them that I am indeed qualified for the position.

I have been preparing different examples/stories on how I may lack experience but not the skills to advise. What other things I can say or ask at the interview to stand out more? What can I do to prepare myself more? Any advice would be appreciated.
