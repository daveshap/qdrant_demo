My mom won't let me post pictures of myself.
I'm a 15 year old girl and my mom doesn't let me post pics of me on social media. When I do she tells me she is going to take my phone away from me. When I ask her she just tells me the classic "Because I said so.". Anyone experienced something like this or knows why she does it?
