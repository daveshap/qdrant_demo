I let my fiancee down. She needed me, and I didn't realize how badly, and now she's gone.
Truly gone. She didn't dump me. I didn't get home to find all her shit packed away. I found her hanging by the neck from an extension cord from a tree branch in the back yard. 

 I didn't mean to ever let her feel alone, even for a moment. But I fucked it up. I didn't say what I should have said. I thought she'd sleep it off and that would be that.
