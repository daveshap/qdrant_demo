ROB: What needs sorting out?
IAN: Come on, Rob. My relationship with Laura has obviously disturbed you a great deal.
ROB: Funnily enough I haven't been too thrilled about it.
IAN: We are not talking jokey understatement here, Rob. We're talking actionable harassment. Ten phone calls a night, hanging around outside my house...
ROB: Yeah, well, I've stopped all that now.
IAN: We've noticed and we're glad. But, you know... how are we going to make peace here? We want to make things easier for you. What can we do? Obviously I know how special Laura is, and I know things can't be good for you at the moment. I'd hate it if I lost her. But I'd like to think that if she decided she didn't want to see me anymore, I'd respect that decision. Do you see what I'm saying?
ROB: Yeah.
IAN: Good. So shall we leave it at that then?
ROB: I dunno.
IAN: Think about it, Rob.
IAN: Good. So shall we leave it at that then?
ROB: I've already left it, you pathetic rebound fuck! Now get your patchouli stink out of my store.
IAN: Good. So shall we leave it at that then?
ROB: We won't leave it, Ian. Not ever.
DICK: Don't do it, Rob!
BARRY: He's not worth it!
