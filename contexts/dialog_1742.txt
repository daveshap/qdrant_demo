LISA: I thought the worst they would do is fire me. Who knew they took termination so literally?
MILO: Why were you snooping in my office?
LISA: Oh. I liked you. I was checking you out.
MILO: 'Think everybody in this place is here the same reason we are?
LISA: 'Cause their apartments might be bugged?
MILO: I told Teddy about you.
LISA: What'd he say?
MILO: A beautiful geek? What're the chances?""

LISA: Gary.
