Is this example correct? (omitting subject in compound sentence) Had an argument with my colleague regarding the example from \"Advanced Grammar in Use\" by Martin Hewings:<blockquote>  In two years time Morneau will have been acting for 50 years, and  shows no signs of retiring from the theatre.</blockquote>To me it sounds a bit fancy, but clear and grammatically correct. However, my colleague insists that it should be corrected in one of these ways:In two years time Morneau will have been acting for 50 years, and he shows no signs of retiring from the theatre.In two years time Morneau will have been acting for 50 years, and yet shows no signs of retiring from the theatre.Morneau will have been acting for 50 years in two years time, and shows no signs of retiring from the theatre.So do you think if it's correct grammatically and stylistically? Can someone think of similar sentences, some real life examples?
