FRED: So?
RENEE: Two detectives are coming out.
FRED: That's it.
ED: Let's have a look at the hallway outside the bedroom.
AL: Very strange.
RENEE: What is?
AL: The angle. The high angle shot on the tape.
ED: How'd the camera get so high like that?
AL: And smooth... Almost no movement - back and forth, I mean.
ED: Like you'd get if it was hand held.
AL: Right... This just glided along.
