Is anyone else incapable of using noise canceling headphones in public?
I just get a feeling I’m missing something or I’m in danger and can’t tell cause I can’t hear well. Is this common with anxiety or is this something else?

Edit: my first post on here and its a big difference taking to people with anxiety about something like this and people with “anxiety”

Edit: First ever reward thank you sm, I don’t deserve it especially on a post like this.
