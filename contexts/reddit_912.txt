One of the most annoying things about panic attacks: No matter how many times you've had identical symptoms and came out fine, they're still just as terrifying.
Double annoying: Because we're always fine after a panic attack, a panic attack is actually a sign that everything is fine and you're not in any danger.

But its still terrifying every time. I hate panic attacks.
