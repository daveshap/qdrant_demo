MtG Arena: Fifth card after draft or selaed I recently played some drafts and sealed games in Magic the Gathering Arena and  was wondering what happens when I draft a card (or get a card in sealed) that I already have four times in my collection. Do I get a wildcard for my collection, similar to when I open packs or is it \"lost\" after I'm done with my run?
