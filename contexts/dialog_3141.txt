VICKI: What is this stuff? Kevlar?
BATMAN: Better. It's not on the market yet.
VICKI: It doesn't protect your head, though.
BATMAN: That's why I wear a target on my chest.
VICKI: How'd you find this place?
BATMAN: Exploring. In the woods. Many years ago. -- I was a solitary child.
BATMAN: They don't come down here. They're afraid of the lights.
VICKI: I loathe bats.
BATMAN: So did I, once. But I kept coming back, and... I guess I became the thing I feared most.
VICKI: What is that?
BATMAN: Photo database. I'll do your photos now.
BATMAN: They've got it all wrong. They're watching the warehouses, the loading docks, looking for a tamperer. The Joker is supplying tainted ingredients at the source.
VICKI: That can't be right. That would mean every shipment of every product is poisoned. We'd all be dead.
BATMAN: No. Every product contains one component. The elements react in combination. Hair spray won't do it. But hair spray and perfume and lipstick will. Untraceable. It's very elegant.
VICKI: I just can't absorb it all. This place, the equipment. What it must have cost. Why all the secrecy? Why do you wear the mask?
BATMAN: I don't want to jeopardize anyone close to me.
VICKI: If you don't mind my asking... Who's close to you?
