BROCK: He likes you. Kincaid and I have always had similar tastes...
SELINA: In women?
BROCK: No, in art. I try not bring up women around Kincaid. It's a sore spot between us. Long story..
SELINA: I'll bet. Funny, for some reason, I don't think dogs are supposed to like me.
BROCK: You say that like an amnesia victim.
SELINA: Guilty. I am.
BROCK: Ouch. I hope you're not offended by aggressively curious men.
SELINA: I don't know. I can't remember.
