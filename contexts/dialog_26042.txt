LENNY: Shoulda told me about your new gig, buddy.
MAX: I was gonna tell ya. Hey, it's just a job. I feel like shit about it.
LENNY: You should feel like shit.
MAX: I figured, what the hell, I could take the prick's money and make sure Faith was OK at the same time. Do us both good. Right?
LENNY: Fairly twisted logic, Max, even for you. Hey, at least you got a job! Watch her for me. Stay on her.
MAX: I'm on her.
