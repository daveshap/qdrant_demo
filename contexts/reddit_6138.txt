should i quit my new job after 2 months?
Recently started a new job. Its been almost 2 months. Its a mid senior level position in supply chain. The training has been minimal, the workload insane where i am spending 8 hours on the weekend trying to catch io. My boss is never available when i have questions. He expects me to figute it out on my own. I am really stressed and really dont like the culture of the company. Probation period ia 6 months long and i dont feel i will pass probation.

There is a position opening at a friends company. The role would be a bit less pay, a bit more junior but the company is great he said. I applied to that role and really thinking of taking it if i get an offer.

How bad would it be quitting after 2 months? I really dont think im a good fit for thie company and role.
