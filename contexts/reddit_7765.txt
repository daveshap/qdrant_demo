My dad doesn't believe me when I say I'm expected to be on-campus for research in the Fall even if classes are online (I'm starting a PhD at Texas A&M).
He's supporting me a little bit financially but he doesn't want me "to be the only one on campus" even if it's for doing research for my assistantship so that I can get paid. His reasoning has to do with paying for an apartment (he's helping me out just a little bit to help lessen the burden of getting a very secure apartment so he doesn't have to worry). My dad doesn't believe me to the point where he says he's going to call the Office of Research to see what's up (I don't know if FERPA comes into play with that because research is different from person to person).

I already know I have to show up in person to start the onboarding process (which I have told him multiple times), and I asked my graduate advisor (not faculty advisor) about it and am waiting for her response. I just don't know what to do about this. My research isn't considered essential and doesn't have to do with living organisms. Could someone please give advice or input on this?

UPDATE: He apparently told my sister and not me (she's way older if that gives insight) that he's not actually going to call them. Yay for scare tactics. He has a past of being controlling like this.

UPDATE 2: He got mad at me for making a smart Alec comment, which I admit was wrong. It escalated to where I told him how messed up it is he would threaten something like calling my school. It hit the point where he said, “I won’t lose sleep if you never talk to me again” after I told him he was at risk of losing me as his daughter. I might end up posting this to another reddit because I honestly don’t know what to do now.
