WES: It's a map, I think that's what it is.
EPPS: There you go, Jaeger. Just find the buried treasure, and you're a millionaire.
JAEGER: You think?
EPPS: Yeah, that's exactly what I think. You and the five thousand other suckers who bought those boxes. Let's get out of here. We got sand to protect.
JAEGER: Woods.
WOODS: Hey, Jaeger. What's up.
JAEGER: I'm looking for a favor. I need a map of Iraqi.
WOODS: A map? All I got is maps. I'm gonna have Delayed Map Syndrome when I finally get out of here. What kind of map you need? Topographical, geographical, thermal?
