DRUMLIN: ... Arrangements also have to be made for the V.I.P.s coming in, mostly religious leaders...
ELLIE: What? Why?
DRUMLIN: The theological ramifications of all this are obvious; the President feels we need to include religious interests rather than alienate them. She's also named Palmer Joss as their liaison; he's requested a meeting with you.
ELLIE: With me.
DRUMLIN: Apparently he's genuinely interested in science. This could be a chance to win him over.
ELLIE: I'm going to convert Mr. Science-is- the-root-of-all-evil? This is absurd, David. We have work to do here, I don't have time to play babysitter to the God Squad.
DRUMLIN: Ellie --
DRUMLIN: I want you to listen to me, carefully. The minute the implications of this message became clear, this stopped being simply a scientific matter and became a political one -- an extremely complex, extremely volatile one. There are forces at work here you don't understand; I can help you up to a point, but only up to a point.
ELLIE: Are you threatening me?
DRUMLIN: It's not a threat, Ellie, it's a fact -- if you're not careful, you may find yourself out in the cold very quickly. Play ball. Really. It's good advice.
