PETER: That sounds pathetic, doesn't it?
ROBIN: What are you doing home?
PETER: I always felt I could never marry you without first showing you what a fabulous life you cloud live despite me.
ROBIN: You never really trusted me.
PETER: You live a fabulous life, Robin.
ROBIN: Despite you.
PETER: I never asked for more.
ROBIN: That's the problem.
PETER: Please don't leave me.
PETER: Where are the kids?
ROBIN: Sam took them to a movie.
PETER: I'll be in the bedroom.
