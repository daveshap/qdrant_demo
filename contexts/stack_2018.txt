What is the idiom/phrase you can use when someone tells you to do (the work) that he is assigned to do (in reality it is assigned to him)? What is the idiom/phrase you can use when someone tells you to do (the work) that he is assigned to do (in reality it is assigned to him). For example:XYZ company is located in Harbor port premises in Dubai city.Mike - officer at XYZ company.Joe  - the Security Administrator XYZ company and works at the harbor port gate.Mike (calls joe on his extension at the gate): Hello Mr. Joe.I have these 3 gentlemen flying in from London to Dubai by flight # 9W-216 tomorrow morning. They are coming to visit us. They need to enter the harbor port security gate at 10:00 am. Just check whether their gate passes are still valid. They had visited us last week so it must be still valid. Joe answers: Ok, let me see. Joe sends the entire spreadsheet with the list of people who have valid gate-passes to Mike by email.Mike (after receiving the list, again calls Joe): Joe, whats this list for ? Joe: You can check in the list for their names.Here It is Joe's job to do the checking. But he unintelligently dumps the list to check for the men on to Mike. Mike like to respond to him by saying, Joe you are __________ or Jor you cannot ___________.PS: For Joe its seems a simple task that Mike can do, while Joe simply misses the fact that its a gross inconsistency on his part (thinking) to expect it from Mike which could mean in principle and considering this example in its extremities that Joe could get away without doing any job and still get paid. This usually occurs when foot-in-the-door requests go haywire.
