LISA: Jesse, God - what happened?
JESSE: I killed him! I killed him!
LISA: Oh, Christ, you're hurt...
JESSE: I killed Grady. I killed Grady, Lisa. I killed Schneider. Oh my God, he's inside me...
LISA: Who, Jesse?
JESSE: he's just waiting to take me. When I sleep.
LISA: Who? Who's doing this to you?
JESSE: Fred Krueger. He's been trying to get hold of me, to use me. He needs me to get out of his world into ours...He's gonna take me again.
LISA: No, Jesse. This isn't happening. It's gotta be everything you've taken in -- Schneider and the diary and the glove -- only it's all mixed up.
