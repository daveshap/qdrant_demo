LYDECKER: You remember you sent some wildcatters out to that plateau, out past the Ilium range, a couple days ago?
SIMPSON: Yeah. What?
LYDECKER: There's a guy on the horn, mom-and-pop survey team. Says he's homing on something and wants to know if his claim will be honored.
SIMPSON: Christ. Some honch in a cushy office on Earth says go look at a grid reference in the middle of nowhere, we look. They don't say why, and I don't ask. I don't ask because it takes two weeks to get an answer out here and the answer's always 'don't ask.'
LYDECKER: So what do I tell this guy?
SIMPSON: Tell him, as far as I'm concerned, he finds something it's his.
