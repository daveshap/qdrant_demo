Don't ghost people
Girls, and guys, if you don't like someone, don't ghost them. Just tell them you would rather stay friends.
I've had a girl tell me after a date that she wanted to stay friends, and I got over it in like a minute because I knew exactly where she stood and I appreciated her telling me. When you ghost someone, it feels shitty because for 2-3 days, they are still hoping you respond, and then after that, they just hate you.
