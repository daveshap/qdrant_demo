So I'm noticing a rather disturbing trend here as of late
I know I'm gonna get down voted to heck for this but I'm noticing a problem here lately.

So i know that "any income > no income" but as a group I have noticed that the general thought or at least the way it presents itself is that minimum wage + a 70 hr work week is the answer to all money problems. Just some quick math federal minimum wage is 7.25x70 hours is 506 before taxes at 9 an hour that is 56.3 hours that is a lot more doable 52 weeks a year. I don't know about the rest of you but I worked 70 hours a week I burnt out I fell back into the hole it took all of 6 months. I have full respect for those who can work for 70 hours a week but its not for everyone the goal always has been find the best job you can, maybe go to school(one class at a time if need be), get a degree and find a better job.

The plan remains the same: Find a job, Live frugally, Pay off debts, Save money and make it to middle class(minimum goal).
