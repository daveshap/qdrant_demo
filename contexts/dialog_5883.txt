GITTES: Your father is Julian Cross, isn't he?
EVELYN: Yes, of course. It was quite a while after. I was just out of grade school when they did that.
GITTES: So you married your father's business partner?
GITTES: You've got one going, Mrs. Mulwray.
EVELYN: Oh.
GITTES: Is there something upsetting about my asking about your father?
EVELYN: No!... Yes, a little. You see Hollis and my fa... my father had a falling out...
GITTES: Over the water department, or over you?
EVELYN: Not over me. Why would they have a falling out over me?
GITTES: Then it was over the water department.
EVELYN: Not exactly. Well, I mean, yes. Yes and no. Hollis felt the public should own the water but I don't think my father felt that way. Actually, it was over the Van der Lip. The dam that broke.
GITTES: Oh, yeah?
EVELYN: Yes. He never forgave him for it.
GITTES: Never forgave him for what?
EVELYN: For talking him into building it, he never forgave my father... They haven't spoken to this day.
GITTES: You sure shout that?
EVELYN: Of course I'm sure.
GITTES: What about you? Do you and your father get along?
