KATE: No?
JACK: Do you have any idea what my life is like?
KATE: Excuse me?
JACK: I wake up in the morning covered in dog saliva...I drop the kids off, spend eight hours selling tires retail...retail, Kate.
JACK: I pick up the kids, walk the dog, which by the way, carries the added bonus of carting away her monstrous crap...I play with the kids, take out the garbage, get six hours of sleep if I’m lucky, and then it starts all over again...and why is it that I always have to drive everyone everywhere? I spend practically my entire day in that slow as hell mini-van listening to Raffi tapes and trying to figure out how the cup holders work...I’m sick of it.
KATE: Really.
JACK: What’s in it for me? Where are my Mary Janes?
KATE: It’s sad to hear your life is such a disappointment to you, Jack.
JACK: I can’t believe it’s not a disappointment to you! Jesus, Kate, I could’ve been a thousand times the man I became. How could you do this to me? How could you let me give up on my dreams like this?!
