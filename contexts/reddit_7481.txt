What is the suggestion of an ideal dissertation?
I'm starting to work on my proposal for my PhD (CS) and I'm looking for resources on how to get started with thinking of ideas for it. Strangers of the internet, can you share a dissertation that you think I should take a look at to get an idea of the expectations of a dissertation?
