The US government shut down on January 19th, 2018. Let’s discuss.
On Saturday, January 19th a bill to fund the federal government until the 16th of February did not receive the required 60 votes.  There have been many submissions in the last 24 hours about the [government shutdown] (http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-42757091), but none conformed to the [subreddit’s guidelines] (https://www.reddit.com/r/NeutralPolitics/wiki/guidelines).

There's a lot of arguing about who is responsible for the shutdown.  

>[Republicans and Conservative news](https://www.dailywire.com/news/26107/whos-blame-government-shutdown-democrats-heres-why-ben-shapiro) sources are labeling it as [*Schumer's shutdown*](http://time.com/5108781/government-shutdown-2018/), saying they need 60 votes to at least extend the budget for an extra 30 days for extended immigration talks. 

>[Democrats and Liberal news](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/1/18/16906634/government-shutdown-blame) sources are saying that Trump and Republicans are to blame since they control all 3 branches of government and Trump had turned down the previous immigration bill that they had worked up because of lack of funding for the wall. A wall [they have openly said](https://www.cnbc.com/2017/10/08/democrats-rule-out-trumps-request-for-border-wall-funding-in-exchange-for-protecting-dreamers.html) they will not fund. 

>A third option, [Blame everyone,](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2018/01/18/if-the-government-shuts-down-heres-your-cheat-sheet-on-which-party-to-blame/?utm_term=.d8cbfc24faf5) in some form.

- /u/FutureNactiveAccount asks, "Who is responsible for the government shutdown?"

Let's explore what the different forces hoped to accomplish by letting it get to this point and whether they have succeeded.  Who stands to gain and lose from the shutdown, both politically and in the general population?  And what does the evidence suggest about the long-term effects of this event?

Is it reasonable for the people to pursue removal or recall of legislators who failed to appropriate funds in time to avoid a shutdown of the government? How might they go about that?
