AGNES: You want to talk about the baby don't you?
MARTHA: Would you like to talk about it?
AGNES: I never saw any baby... I think they made it up.
MARTHA: Why should they?
AGNES: I don't know.
MARTHA: Do you remember the night they said it came?
AGNES: No. I was sick.
MARTHA: How were you sick?
AGNES: Something I ate.
MARTHA: Did it hurt?
AGNES: Yes.
MARTHA: Where?
AGNES: Down... there.
MARTHA: And what did you do?
AGNES: I went to my room.
MARTHA: And what happened?
AGNES: I got sicker.
MARTHA: And then what?
AGNES: I fell asleep.
MARTHA: In the middle of all the pain?
AGNES: Yes.
MARTHA: Where did the baby come from?
AGNES: What baby?
MARTHA: The baby they made up.
AGNES: From their heads...
MARTHA: Is that where they say it came from... ?
AGNES: No, they say it came from the waste paper basket!
MARTHA: Where'd it come from before that?
AGNES: From God.
MARTHA: After God... before the waste-paper basket.
AGNES: I... I don't understand.
MARTHA: Agnes, how are babies born?
AGNES: Don't you know?
MARTHA: Yes I do, but I want you to...
AGNES: I don't understand what you're talking about... you want to talk about the baby... everybody wants to talk about the baby but... I never saw the baby so I can't talk about the baby because... I don't believe in the baby.
MARTHA: Then let's talk about something else...
AGNES: No... no, I'm tired of talking, I've been talking for weeks, nobody believes me when I tell them anything... nobody listens to me.
MARTHA: Agnes...
AGNES: No... no, I don't want to answer any more questions.
MARTHA: Would you like to ask them?
AGNES: What do you mean?
MARTHA: Just that... you ask and I'll answer.
AGNES: Anything?
MARTHA: Anything.
AGNES: What's your real name?
MARTHA: Martha Louise Livingston.
AGNES: Are you married?
MARTHA: No.
AGNES: Would you like to be?
MARTHA: Not at the moment, no.
AGNES: Do you have any children?
MARTHA: No.
AGNES: Would you like some?
MARTHA: I can't have them any more.
AGNES: Why not?
MARTHA: I've stopped menstruating
AGNES: Why do you smoke?
MARTHA: Does it bother you?
AGNES: No questions.
MARTHA: Smoking is an obsession with me. Maybe one day I'll become obsessed with something else, then I'll stop smoking... Do you have any more questions?
AGNES: One.
MARTHA: What?
AGNES: Where do you think babies come from?
MARTHA: From their mothers and fathers of course. Before that, I... I don't know.
AGNES: Well I think they come from... angel lights on their mothers chest and whispers into her ear. That makes good babies start to grow. And bad babies come from when a fallen angel squeezes in down there, and they start to grow, grow, till they come out down there. I don't know where good babies come out. And you can't tell the difference... except bad babies cry a lot... and they make their fathers go away... and their mothers get very ill... die sometimes.
MARTHA: Do you know a Marie?
AGNES: No... do you?
MARTHA: Why should I?
AGNES: I don't know.
MOTHER MIRIAM: Well... what do you think? Is she totally bananas or merely slightly off centre... or maybe she's perfectly sane and just a very good liar.
MARTHA: What's your opinion?
MOTHER MIRIAM: I believe Agnes is different.
MARTHA: From other nuns... Yes I... I've noticed.
MOTHER MIRIAM: From other people! I believe she is not crazy, nor is she lying.
MARTHA: How could she have a baby and know nothing of sex or birth?
MOTHER MIRIAM: Because she's an innocent. She's a slate that's hasn't been touched except by God.
MARTHA: That's ridiculous...
MOTHER MIRIAM: In her case it isn't. She's had very little schooling. Her mother kept her home almost all the time and when her mother died Agnes came here, to us. She's never been out there Doctor. She's never seen a movie or a television show. She's never even read a book.
MARTHA: If she's so innocent, how come she murdered a child?
MOTHER MIRIAM: She didn't! This is manslaughter, not murder. She didn't consciously kill that baby. She'd lost a lot of blood. She was unconscious by the time we got to her.
MARTHA: So, someone else could have done it.
MOTHER MIRIAM: No... not in the eyes of the police.
MARTHA: And in your eyes?
MOTHER MIRIAM: I've already told you what I thought.
MARTHA: That she was unconscious, yes! So someone easily could have come in the room and killed the...
MOTHER MIRIAM: You don't really believe something like that happened do you?
MARTHA: It's possible isn't it?
MOTHER MIRIAM: Who?
MARTHA: One of the other nuns found out about the baby and... and wanted to avoid a scandal.
MOTHER MIRIAM: That's absurd!
MARTHA: That possibility never occurred to you?
MOTHER MIRIAM: No-one knew about Agnes' pregnancy. No-one. Not even Agnes.
