SAUNDRA: So why this ?
BRUCE: Excuse me ?
SAUNDRA: Why did you build this whole place ?
BRUCE: Is this really the time ?
SAUNDRA: Do you have something better to talk about ?
BRUCE: I just graduated from M.I.T. in engineering. That's when John McCay hired me.
SAUNDRA: He hired you to build this place ?
BRUCE: I was hired in and started to do the boring old work routine. I was originally brought in as a technical advisor. First Bank had sponsored my scholarships.
