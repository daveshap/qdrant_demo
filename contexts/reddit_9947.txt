My small college is looking to change our dining situation. Tell me how your campus does food.
My school has about 800 students, the vast majority of which live on campus and have a meal plan. We have had Sodexo for the past decade or so and we are in the top 5 worst campus food **in the country**. We are looking to get rid of Sodexo and either go with another company (Aramark, Chartwell, Bon Appetit), run our own food service, or maybe look into having local restaurants cater/food trucks/co-ops. The only issue is that our school has very little money to throw around, so we need to know how cost-effective our options are.  Also, being the tiny, super-liberal college that we are, socially responsible/healthy/dietary restriction-friendly food is a major concern.

How does your college/university food service work? How do you like the system/company?
