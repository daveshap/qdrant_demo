In a LDR and BF said he cheated.
Like the title would lead you to think, I'm in a king distance relationship. I have been since around early December. He lives in Canada and I live in the US. He's really good for me and I'm his "dream girl". This morning he told me that during new years he was at a party and he had a friend who was struggling with addiction. He explained it to me as she was gonna go off and do drugs and die if he didn't have sex with her. He said he didn't feel bad about it until last night when we were talking about him coming for a visit.   This was not too long after us making it exclusive. Am I right to feel upset? This is my first relationship. And yesterday I "broke up" with my best friend of six years because she wasn't treating me right and it took me that long to realize it. 

I don't know what to do in this situation. Many of my friends I talk to are online and I met them through him. I told him I needed time to think about what's going on. But I'm angry. And I wonder if im right to be angry.
