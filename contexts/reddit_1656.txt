UNPOPULAR OPINION : Being accepted to a T20 doesn't make you an expert on college admissions
Title is basically self-explanatory. I have followed the whole stat video/college reaction video genre for a while and though I believe they are largely unhealthy (story for a different time), I felt that in the past these had a decent amount of good information. Recently, however, this category of "influencers" has exploded. Especially with platforms like Tik Tok and Youtube, it seems quite literally everyone who gets into an Ivy+ has the "SECRET FORMULA ON HOW TO GET INTO A T20!!!" Here are some of my favorite soundbites...


**"What really got me into x university was..."** - You literally have NOTHING to back this statement up. Unless you talked to your admission officer personally, you do not have any clue as to what got you into the university you chose. It is misleading and disingenuous to talk as though you have some secret insight into what made your application special. It is even worse when said person has a 1600 SAT and 2-gen legacy, and they then go on to say that their 300 word supplemental about learning how to swim is what got them into Stanford. Are you kidding?

**"What really matters is having good essays and extracurriculars!"** - I completely agree with this point. The problem is who doesn't already know this? Who are the kids who think that academics are literally everything? You look up one guide on college admissions and it is probably the first thing on the list. Why do people think it is such a secret that you should "focus on your extracurriculars!"?

**"I got into x school with a 25th percentile SAT, so you can too!"** - This just isn't true, and is one of my biggest gripes. It seems that these influencers want to think that college admission is this 100% holistic process and test scores are just some red herring. It usually turns out that said vlogger either has an extremely extenuating background or S-tier extracurriculars. If you think that you can get into an Ivy with a 1210 because you "write nice," I have bad news. Statistics don't lie. For everyone with a 25th percentile SAT, there are 3 other people at the same universities with a better score. 

More and more it seems like these admission-influencers are really not so much interested in actually helping and more so interested in bragging about their achievements (HOW I GOT INTO HARVARD PART 1????) and spouting meaningless talking points they have heard from others. These types of vids used to be so beneficial but now it seems every video sounds the same. Literally. Turn on two of your stereotypical "HOW I GOT INTO X UNIVERSITY" videos right now. Tell me their points aren't identical. I'll summarize it right now: "Start your ~unique~ essays early. Have continuity in your application. Find something you are passionate about and pursue it. Demonstrate interest in your school." That is it.

 It is so sad to see people who go to truly amazing universities produce content that is so blatantly braggadocious and above all completely unimaginative. It is even more sad to think that kids who don't know better will follow this often misleading advice and start idolizing ivies for no other reason than a cool name.
