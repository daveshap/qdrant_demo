I toured a community college today and I’m excited!
I know it’s not a huge big fancy school, but I’m really excited. I love the atmosphere there it’s so laid back and I can’t wait to study classes I’m actually interested in. I’m really interested in human services and psychology so I got some information on courses involving those. Aaa I’m just so excited to finish school and go there! I hope everyone gets to go to the school they’re excited about. Good luck everyone :)
