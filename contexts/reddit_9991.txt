HE/SA Grad School App Advice
I'm a recent graduate with a BS in Developmental Psych from a reputable public University in the Northeast. I had a 3.4 cumulative/ 3.8 major GPA, a little volunteer/relevant work experience, but I did not take the GRE, was never an RA, and I took a gap year to travel. I'm applying to Shippensburg, Bloomsburg, Pitt, and Colorado State (none of which require GREs). Does anyone have any insight to offer me, as far as my chances of admission go? Or even any advice on how to incorporate my gap year experience into a positive thing instead of a "I-thought-I-was-getting-a-Fulbright-and-didn't-get-promoted-to-finalist" thing? Any personal experiences are welcome!
