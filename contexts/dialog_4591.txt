JOHNNIE: So Caesar, what did it total out at?
CAESAR: Two point one seventy-six.
JOHNNIE: Unbelievable. Can you believe that, Violet?
GINO: Hey, Johnnie ...
JOHNNIE: Come on, Pop, all I want to know is one thing. Just one thing after he made such a big deal out of it. I bet it wasn't a big deal. Was it, Caesar?
CAESAR: What's that, Johnnie?
JOHNNIE: The money I bet it was nothing to get it clean, after you made such a fucking big deal ...
GINO: Johnnie, what did I say?
JOHNNIE: Pop, this is important to me. It's a simple question. if he would just answer the question, that's the end of it.
CAESAR: Where is this going, Johnnie?
JOHNNIE: Just admit it, Caesar.
CAESAR: Admit what?
JOHNNIE: That you overreacted. That you lost it. Not me. It was your mistake.
CAESAR: All right, Johnnie, you want to play it this way, I can play it this way. You want to know who made a mistake, why don't you open the case.
VIOLET: Caesar ...
CAESAR: Shut up, Violet! This is between me and Johnnie.
