What should I study in colleage if I want to own a company which builds and sells sex toys?
It would be BDSM theamed. Besides regular things like whips, nipple clamps, fuck machines, gloves, leather suits, butt plugs, harnesses for dildos etc I have ideas for new ones. Like discrete BDSM sex toys jewerly etc. 

The problem is for now I only have ideas and zero skills. For my personality it better fits to do the marketing, reaserch what customers want and give ideas what to build. I don't really have the desire to build it myself.

My question is: what should I study in colleage? In my country it is free, so no problems with debt or anything. Just with conservative parents :). Of course I haven't told them my plans, but I know they would disapprove.

Should I go the engineering route or business school? I am capable of learning both, but business and economics is a better fit for me.

I am a rookie, so advice no matter how basic is welcomed. Cheers!
