TINA: I work too, but I still make time.
MOOKIE: Tina, what do you want me to do?
TINA: I want you to spend some time with me. I want you to try and make this relationship work. If not, I'd rather not be bothered.
MOOKIE: Alright. Alright. I'll be over there sometime today.
TINA: When?
MOOKIE: Before I get off work.
TINA: Bring some ice cream, I'm burning up. Do you love me?
MOOKIE: Do I love you?
