TUCKER: Really? But he's been married for twenty years -- they've got six kids.
HEALY: Nice smokescreen, isn't it?
MARY: Pat does projects all over the world.
TUCKER: Where would I have seen your work?
HEALY: Have you been to Let's see -- Santiago, Chile?
TUCKER: Absolutely! I was there twice last year. Which building is yours?
HEALY: Do you know the... soccer stadium?
TUCKER: Did you build the Estadio Olympico?
HEALY: No... just down the street, the Amigo Tower.
TUCKER: I'm sorry, I'm not familiar with it. What style?
HEALY: Uh, sort of nouveau Deco... with a big vestibule. Check it out next time you're up there.
TUCKER: You know, I really should take your card.
HEALY: Oh look, it's Doob! Will you excuse me a minute, Tucker?
