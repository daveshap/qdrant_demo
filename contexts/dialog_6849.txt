ANNETTE: You know it amazes me that someone as bright as you can be so horrible.
SEBASTIAN: What? Another letter from your friend?
ANNETTE: This is my favorite part. Even more treacherous and dangerous than he is charming and fascinating. He has never taken a single step or spoken a single word without some dishonorable or criminal intention. Every young girl he has successfully pursued has regretted it.
SEBASTIAN: You know you could at least have the decency of telling me who's badmouthing me so I might have the opportunity to confront them face to face. How do you know it's not some girl who's pissed off at me for breaking up with her?
ANNETTE: I sincerely doubt it.
SEBASTIAN: Give me the fucking letter.
ANNETTE: The last thing I need is you going into my room searching for this while I'm away.
SEBASTIAN: Is that the last thing you need? My your clever.
ANNETTE: How's the water?
SEBASTIAN: Refreshing.
ANNETTE: About what?
SEBASTIAN: About what you said today in the stable. I'm not a happy person.
ANNETTE: I never said that.
SEBASTIAN: You implied it.
ANNETTE: Look, I didn't mean to give you a hard time.
SEBASTIAN: No, it's okay. I mean I look at you with all your morals and values and well, YOU seem to be happy in your choices. I envy you. No bullshit.
ANNETTE: Thank you.
SEBASTIAN: Seriously, you're amazing. You have everything going for you. You're smart, you're beautiful, you're determined. You're everything I want in a girlfriend.
ANNETTE: Shut up.
SEBASTIAN: I wasn't kidding. I'd like to take you out.
ANNETTE: Look, I'm flattered but, seriously it could never work.
SEBASTIAN: Why not?
ANNETTE: Because you act like a pig.
SEBASTIAN: Do you deny that there's an attraction between us?
ANNETTE: I don't... I don't want to answer that... look we're friends.
SEBASTIAN: You don't find me cute? Come on, look at these muscles.
ANNETTE: I'm sorry, but you're not my type.
SEBASTIAN: Fine. Friends it is. I can live with that.
ANNETTE: You're naked.
SEBASTIAN: It's my house.
ANNETTE: That's repulsive.
SEBASTIAN: What's the big deal? We're friends. Haven't you ever seen your friends naked before?
