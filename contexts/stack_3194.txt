How cold does it get around Dementors? In the movie Harry Potter and the Prisonzer of Azkaban (#3), there's a scene where Sirius is lying on the shore of a lake or pond and Harry is sitting next to him.In this scene, Dementors arrive and, as usual, the temperature drops. Harry notices this before he even sees the Dementors. He watches while the lake seems to freeze over in the course of a few seconds.Without magic, it would require an extremely low temperature to freeze a body of water that size in that amount of time. I'm not a thermodynamics expert, but we're definitely talking about such extreme temperatures that a human would typically die in a matter of minutes.How cold was it really?Do Dementors drop the temperature that dramatically? If so, how do witches and wizards survive without experiencing hypothermia or frostbite?Does the lake freeze so quickly because of some sort of magical \"cold enchantment\" that the Dementors possess?Is it really so cold that a Muggle would die, but witches and wizards are able to protect themselves through some sort of \"warmth\" enchantment?
