GIRL: Something like that.
WALTER: That was terrific.
GIRL: You should hear the bird.
WALTER: You live around here?
GIRL: Not too far. Are you a bird-watcher too?
WALTER: Me? Nah. I'm more of a people watcher.
GIRL: Were you watching me?
WALTER: Not at first. You would stare at the tops of the trees so intently. Any second I thought you would take off and fly.
GIRL: I have to go.
WALTER: Do you come here often?
GIRL: My daddy likes me home before dark.
WALTER: It's good to listen to your daddy.
