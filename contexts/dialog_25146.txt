KIRK: You've got to learn WHY things work on a Starship. It's coming through now, Khan...
SPOCK: The prefix code is 16309. All commands from each Starship bridge are relayed electronically; each ship has its own prefix combination code...
KHAN: Thirty seconds...
KIRK: ... to prevent an enemy from doing just what we're attempting; using <u>our</u> console to tap in a message, an order to lower Reliant's damn shields...
SPOCK: Let's hope he hasn't changed the combination. He's quite intelligent...
KIRK: Wait for my signal, Spock -- too soon and he'll have time to figure it out and raise them again.
KIRK: Khan, how do I know you'll keep your word?
KHAN: I've given you no word to keep, Admiral. In my judgment, you simply have no alternative.
KIRK: I take your point. Stand by to receive our transmission.
KIRK: Mr. Sulu, lock phasers on target and await my command...
SULU: Phasers locked...
KHAN: Time's up, Admiral...
KIRK: Here it comes. Now, Spock.
JOACHIM: Sir -- our shields are dropping!
KHAN: Raise them --
JOACHIM: They won't --
KHAN: <u>Where's the over-ride</u>??
