ICHABOD: Only the heirs were killed. Proof that the Horseman slaughters by assignment.
YOUNG MASBATH: But, if the farm is not mine, who stole it away?
ICHABOD: No one yet, far as I can tell. It has gone intestate.
YOUNG MASBATH: In test... what?
ICHABOD: Intestate. Your farm... all the farms... they belong to no one.
YOUNG MASBATH: What does it mean?
ICHABOD: Often in such cases, property which has gone intestate legally passes to whomever the deceased was indebted to. And, who in this town is owed a great many debts?
YOUNG MASBATH: Baltus Van Tassel.
ICHABOD: Did your father take a loan?
YOUNG MASBATH: Yes. I rode with him on payment days.
