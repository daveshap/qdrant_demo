Certificate and key abuse I made a mistake several years ago by uploading OpenSSL certificate key (.pem and .pk8) into a blog post. The key was used to sign Android apk using SignApk.jar tool. Someone took it and used the key to sign malware apps and the bad story was i put my email address when created that certificate. This raised issues because people accused me as the creator of those apps.The question is, how can i recover this situation? some people suggest key revocation, but i don't quite understand it. As far as read from arround the net, the revocation needs to be uploaded to a CA, what CA?
