MICHAELS: Yes, Alan.
CARTER: Meet Grant. This is Dr. Michaels, Chief of the Medical Section.
MICHAELS: Glad to have you with us, Mr. Grant.
GRANT: Wish I knew why.
CARTER: Tell him where he fits in, will you? I've got a few things to check out.
MICHAELS: We need you for Security purposes, Mr. Grant.
GRANT: At an operation?
MICHAELS: They know they failed to kill Benes. Security thinks they'll try again, first chance they get. We're afraid of medical sabotage -- or surgical assassination.
GRANT: Surgical assassination?! But that means you suspect --
CARTER: [LINE OF DIALOGUE CUT OFF]
MICHAELS: I don't agree. Just because he's often difficult --
CARTER: Difficult? He's impossible!
MICHAELS: That's no reason to suspect him of disloyalty.
GRANT: But why take the chance, when there must be other doctors?
CARTER: We have no choice. Duval's the most skillful brain surgeon in the country, and he's right here, at hand.
GRANT: I wouldn't know if he's trying to save him or kill him.
MICHAELS: I'll be standing by. <I'll> know.
CARTER: And no matter what happens, you're to take orders <only> from Dr. Michaels, understand?
GRANT: Right, sir.
CARTER: Come along, they'll be operating shortly. See you later, Mike.
