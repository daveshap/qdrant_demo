INVESTIGATOR: Who knows with these deficients"? His profile indicates a proclivity for violence."
DETECTIVE HUGO: I'll run a crossover on the eyelash for any family or associate connections--
INVESTIGATOR: --I've already run it. There's no record of any living relative.
DETECTIVE HUGO: What a pity.
INVESTIGATOR: Detective Hugo, it's a simple case of lost and found. All we have to do is locate the man who's minus an eyelash and this murder will solve itself.
