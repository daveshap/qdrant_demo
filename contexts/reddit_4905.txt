How to help my girlfriend with severe depression?
My (19M) girlfriend (19F) of one and a half years has struggled with varying severities of depression throughout her life but recently it has become very difficult for her. Unfortunately, due to a heart condition she is unable to take certain medication including antidepressants. Additionally, her parents are fairly dismissive of mental illness, and even if she were able to take medication her parents would disapprove. Obviously this makes treating her depression very hard and I canâ€™t stand watching her struggle. Over the last month she said she just feels so alone and frequently thinks about suicide or self harm. If anyone in similar situations or otherwise has any suggestions for ways I could help her get through this trying time I would be very grateful. Activites, date ideas, or just ways I should compose myself would be greatly appreciated.
