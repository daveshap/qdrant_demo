My cat hates me
She was initially my boyfriend's cat since she was a kitten and was notorious for only snuggling with him. When I moved in with my partner, she took time to warm up to me, but after some time she would snuggle up with me as well. She spent an entire winter in our room with us, that was her favorite place. We moved rooms, and she moved with us.

Then I visited home for a month, and as far as I know, she was still snuggling with my partner that whole time. When I came back, she wanted nothing to do with me. At first I thought she needed time to adjust, but the other cats warmed up to me quickly. Our cat refuses to be in our room. She runs away from me, and has even been mildly hostile towards me. I was hoping she would warm up after a week or so but its been two months. Getting along with her like we used to is important to me. I don't know what's happened.
