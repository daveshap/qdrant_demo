How do you start wanting to work again?
At 35, I am completely burnt out on my career. I got my PhD in a technical field. Afterward, I was briefly in academia. By the time I moved into industry 3 years ago, I already hated everything about the field I work in. After my time in companies, the idea of having to do anything for anyone (in a transactional, work-related way) makes me physically ill.

It's been over a year since I last applied for a job. If I see a job I'm qualified for, I give up at the thought of having to lie to someone's face and pretend any kind of enthusiasm for technical work. When someone asks me about "data", or "machine learning", it's the best I can do to hold back my bile.

If I see a job in a different career (and hence something I might potentially hate less), I'm turned off simply by the idea of having to self-promote.

I'm trapped by my semi-irrational avoidance of work-related bullshit, even as I miss being engaged in projects and... having good week days. I know to get out of this situation (whether that means career change or whatever), I am going to have to get through distasteful and uncomfortable situations, but I don't know if I \*can\* anymore.

I miss feeling excited and motivated by a new challenge, but I don't know how to recover that mindset. Anything positive about work  - whether money or the work itself - is completely overshadowed by the nightmare of politics and hierarchy. I also despise anything related to writing/creating software (which seems to be all anyone wants me to do).

I'm currently employed, but I dread every day of work and do the absolute bare minimum possible. It's not good.

Has anyone been in a similar situation? How do I get out of this?

Edit: Overwhelmed by the response to this. Thanks everyone.
