JEFF: I'm not exactly on the other side of the room.
LISA: Your mind is. And when I want a man, I want all of him.
JEFF: Don't you ever have any problems?
LISA: I have one now.
JEFF: So do I.
LISA: Tell me about it.
JEFF: Why would a man leave his apartment three times, on a rainy night, with a suitcase? And come back three times?
LISA: He likes the way his wife welcomes him home.
JEFF: Not that salesman's wife. And why didn't he go to work today?
LISA: Homework. It's more interesting.
JEFF: What's interesting about a butcher's knife and a small saw wrapped up in a newspaper?
LISA: Nothing, thank heaven.
JEFF: Why hasn't he gone into his wife's bedroom all day?
LISA: I wouldn't dare answer that.
JEFF: Lisa -- there's something terribly wrong.
