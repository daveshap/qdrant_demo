Is there any way to find out if any alteration is done to any table? I am using SQL Server and a database has too many tables. I am preparing the list of tables which have been recently modified.Is there any way to find out which tables are modified?I am interested in knowing:  if any datatypes are modified to any columns,  new column is added,  any column is deleted.NoteThe answers below shows tables which has been modified but do not give enough information of what changes has been done to the tables.
