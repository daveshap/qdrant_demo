SIDNEY: I know Steve. No.
HUNSECKER: Then maybe you can tell me if he's as solid as you say, why does he rap me every chance he gets?
SUSAN: Sidney is a liar!
HUNSECKER: Who said Sidney?
SUSAN: I said Sidney!...
HUNSECKER: You know, dear, we're drifting apart, you and I, and I don't like that.
SUSAN: I thought we were talking about Sidney?
HUNSECKER: Let me finish, dear. You had your say, now let me have mine...
SUSAN: I haven't said anything yet, J.J., but if -
HUNSECKER: I started to say we're drifting apart. A year ago, in your wildest dreams, would you have walked by that door without taking up this situation with me? Today I had to call you in!
SUSAN: I'm taking up the situation with you now...
HUNSECKER: Susie, I want to help you--, there's nothing I won't do for you. You're all I've got in the whole, wide world.
HUNSECKER: Well, what have I got? Alimony to a pair of tramps? They're of no concern to me. It's you who count, but don't get me wrong - I don't intend to let you break your neck again!
SIDNEY: J.J., you said you want to help me - prove it!
HUNSECKER: How?
SIDNEY: Get Steve back his job...please...
HUNSECKER: He means that much to you...?
SIDNEY: Yes. With your prestige" it only takes a minute - ten cents worth of American Tel and Tel."
HUNSECKER: You're picking up my lingo, hon.
SIDNEY: I read your column every day...
HUNSECKER: Susie, I like this new attitude of yours. You're growing up and I like it! I don't like it when you're limp and dependent, when you're odd and wayward. This gives you a chance for real survival in a very lousy world. Because, don't forget, dear, you won't always have me with you, will you...?
SIDNEY: No, I won't...
