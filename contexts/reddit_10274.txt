Please, At Least Read The Last Few Sentences
This is a lot to read. So if you don't want to read it all, then please just read the last few sentences. You can even ignore the link.

I don't know why I keep writing these. There must have been many who have reached out for help numerous times, having done everything right, putting up a good fight, only to submit to that dark desire. It's not as though people notice when a stranger stops crying out in pain. We expect people to *not* cry out in pain most of the time. That's just how things are normally. It's the chaotic pleas that catch our attention *because* its unexpected. Yet, how many people have the strength, or desire, to tend to those that are suffering? If you ignore someone in pain, you take no responsibility for them unless you're personally called on. We only actively tend to others if there is a reward, or a heightened sense of sympathy.

I find it common for others to do just enough to keep you from committing suicide, but few do more than that. I don't think we should be babied, but it certainly feels like we get abandoned.

It's common to feed a starving person until they are strong enough, tend to a broken body until they are strong enough, raise a small child until they are strong enough, or even nurture a dying animal until they are strong enough. But not the emotionally damaged.

So why do I keep writing these? Desperation, probably. I know full well that, even under the banner of "suicide watch", most people come here squeezing out their last drops of hope over mounds of despair; taking that last gamble that maybe someone can save them. I'm sure there are a great number of them who never actually commit suicide, but what about those who did? How many messages are on this subreddit that serve as someone's last words? Will this be my final message to the world?

Like I said; I don't think most of us commit suicide *just* to die. We die as a last resort to end our suffering. At the same time, I don't think any of us live just to live. We *want* goals, passions, a sense of belonging, self-worth, feelings of accomplishment. Yet we're told not to die because it's "better" to live. Even if that means living in misery.

It's at this point that I realize I'm only writing for myself. I'd *like* it if someone heard my cry for help, but I'm just another drop in the ocean, aren't I?

I dunno.

I opened this with the intent on explaining why I feel suicidal. *My* [reason](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/dyj1z0/ive_been_battling_depression_for_nineteen_years/). But I've been repeating myself as it is online and offline.

If someone *is* reading this, then thank you for at least hearing me out.

If someone is reading this; I'm scared. I'm scared that I won't be able to hold this off anymore. So I'll just imagine that I'm not alone. That maybe this message connects us.

I'll just pretend that someone is reading this. So, just in case I can't hold on, I won't be alone in the end.

Thank you.
