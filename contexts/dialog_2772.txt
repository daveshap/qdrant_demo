CHARLIE: ...Listen to me belly-achin'. As if my problems amounted to a hill of beans. How goes the life of the mind?
BARTON: Well, it's been better. I can't seem to get going on this thing. That one idea, the one that lets you get started – I still haven't gotten it. Maybe I only had one idea in me – my play. Maybe once that was done, I was done being a writer. Christ, I feel like a fraud, sitting here staring at this paper.
CHARLIE: Those two love-birds next door drivin' you nuts?
BARTON: How did you know about that?
CHARLIE: Know about it? I can practically see how they're doin' it. Brother, I wish I had a piece of that.
BARTON: Yeah, but –
CHARLIE: Seems like I hear everything that goes on in this dump. Pipes or somethin'. I'm just glad I don't have to ply MY trade in the wee-wee hours.
CHARLIE: ...Ah, you'll lick this picture business, believe me. You've got a head on your shoulders. What is it they say? Where there's a head, there's a hope?
BARTON: Where there's life there's hope.
