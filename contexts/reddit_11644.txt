I have too many filters, and I'm about crack.
I can feel it pressing in against my chest. My most empathetic friend asked if I was okay, but I think I got her to think I was okay.

I have filters. I am gay, I am an atheist, I go to an all girl's school, I am an older sibling, I am a doctor's daughter, among other things. I am privileged and nothing is wrong with my life. But I feel like I'm being undone from the inside out. 

You see, I am never all of these things at once. At school, I'm not gay, and only rarely an atheist. And when I'm a doctor's daughter, I'm only an older sibling and who attends an all girl's school. So I have these 'filters'. And every single filter meshes like a quilt to make the mask I need.

I usually can let loose and not worry about filters, and relax. I didn't realize how important this time was until today. I didn't get to unwind yesterday. I had to be a doctor's daughter, and an older sister. And I didn't get to be gay or an atheist or my own freaking person.

I feel like I have a huge weight pressing against my chest. I have to make it through two more hours before I can think about dropping the act, but I feel like I'm not going to make it. I know I won't, because I always suck it up and move on. But it's pressing on me. I just want to make it college so I can drop at least some of my filters. I just want to be done.
