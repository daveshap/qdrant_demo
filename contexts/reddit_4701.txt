Music that I feel would help people dealing with hardships to listen to.
Look up Boyce Avenue. The album is so perfect for the explanation of life events. From a bad breakup, feeling lonely, how not to be hard on yourself, etc. highly highly recommend. Hope it helps people looking for some answers but donâ€™t have the person there then to tell you.
