I tried to save a man and I couldn't. And now I just drove my girlfriend away.
2 days ago, long story short about the man, I tried to provide medical aid to someone who was critically injured by another person. I have trained a lot of medical stuff but I'm no field surgeon. He was unconscious and bleeding heavily. I controlled as much of the bleeding as I could, my partners and I gave CPR, worked the guy for 10 minutes. He ended up getting a pulse and he actually woke up; and after learning he later died on the table, the image of him looking into our eyes, scared as fuck, is just really fucking me up. I didn't know him. But I thought we saved him. We were fist bumping like "fuck yeah dude he's gonna make it"

So, my girlfriend of 8 months and I have been having issues. I struggle with anxiety. She struggles with confrontation. Communication is difficult between us. So anyway, the night after the guy passed I just tried to talk to my homies and handle it. Last night I really wanted to talk to my girlfriend. I tried to stop by her work (this is normal for me, when we both work I usually bring her a letter with a quote that is meaningful and just writing to her that I love her. I wrote one last night too about getting through the hard times basically) anyways, apparently I just missed her leaving.

So I called her twice and got no answer. My lunch break was now over so I texted her what happened and that I just want to see her. She called a while later but I had to go back to work, but I told her I needed her. She knows I get off at 1am so she said call when I'm off. I did. No answer. So I went by her house, she wasn't home. I tried to call again, no answer. By this time I'm nearly having a mental break down. I guess I expected her to be waiting for me when I got off, and seeing she was out and about made me feel really fucking insignificant. But maybe I shouldn't project those expectations on her?

So I text her " I need to talk right now. This cannot wait until tomorrow. I need to talk right now."

She replied " I can't do this. Sorry. You don't get to dictate when we have to do things. You need more than I can give. You deserve someone who is on the same wave length as you, that's not me."

I'm not by any means perfect in this relationship. But I try EVERY SINGLE DAY to do better about the anxiety and such. Literally EVERY DAY I read articles, talk to my friends, etc etc. But after that guy losing his life after I tried to help him, I just wanted to hold my loved one. 

&#x200B;

I just don't know what to make of it all. I'm not going to beg her to be there anymore. But, it hurts. I'm fucked up and now I'm alone.
