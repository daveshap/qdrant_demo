Email to a recruiter
Hi, 

I interviewed extensively for a job then got rejected on the final round. I got the automated rejection email first, then a recruiter emailed yesterday saying she was sorry and that I did really well but they overestimated their spots to candidates and therefore did not have space. She said there might be more spots in a few months and she will let me know.

I want to send her a reply saying I was bummed out for the rejection but being positive about the interviewing experience and the company in general. I also want to state specifically what I am interested in and say to keep in touch with updates. 

&#x200B;

Please help me craft the email if you can. 

Thanks
