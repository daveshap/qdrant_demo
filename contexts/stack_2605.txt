How to compute a partial OD matrix over a network, given the origin and destination? I have two point layers, one of origin and one of targets. Every origin point refer to a specific target point. I would like to compute the cost of the travel between every starting point and his target point, and then join the output table to the origin point layer to show origin points who are \"badly affected\". I have tried to use the Qneat3 plugin, but it generates an OD-matrix for every couple of points in the origin and target layer. I have also tried to use the destination's ID field as unique ID for the origin point, in order to be able to filter my output OD-matrix, but I'm then unable to perform the join between the table and the origin point layer.
