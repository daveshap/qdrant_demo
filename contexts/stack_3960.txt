Generating very few samples from a probability distribution using MCMC? Since MCMC converges to target only after taking very large number of steps, what if I want to have just say 10 samples from target distribution? Do I still have to generate lots of samples, and then discard the rest?Or like machine learning models, is there seperate training and testing part, where a model is trained to project an easy-to-sample distribution to our desired one?
