Slow down. It may feel like you have to keep up with the fast pace of everyone around you but you absolutely do not have to.
I've been more mindful about the speed of which I talk at, and I've noticed that I think I may be talking at a speed I'm not too comfortable at. Maybe it's my unconscious nature to do so, in order to 'keep up' with people. I hope to get in the habit of slowing my speech down just a tad so as to stumble and stutter less. 

I've also been trying to think more about the state of my body. 
Is your body relaxed right now? Do you shake your leg? Why aren't you still? Unless you're exercising, you should be still and calm.
