No electric current going into Water Heater We bought a brand new water heater back in November. Came home last night to no hot water.  Check circuit breaker and it wasn't tripped.  Turned it off an on anyway.  Nothing.  Hit reset button on thermostat, nothing.  Check for electric current per manufacturers instructions and there was nothing.   Put in a new circuit breaker.  Still nothing.   What else could it be?
