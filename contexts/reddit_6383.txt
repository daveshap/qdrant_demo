If you get a better offer soon after being hired, I don't think you should quit (Despite popular advice here)
The question comes up a lot here:

*I got hired and worked with with company A for two weeks.  Now my dream job at company B just made me an offer.  Should I quit?*

And the answer in this subreddit seems to always be the same:

*Yes.  The company doesn't really care about you, and if it wasn't working out for the company, they wouldn't hesitate to fire you.*

I've come to disagree with this advice. First, I don't really think this line of reasoning is entirely true.  Yes, this is true for some companies, but in my experience, it doesn't happen very often.  Usually, employers fire new hires with a reasonable cause.  If a perfect candidate suddenly sends her resume a few weeks after a position is filled, a manager normally wouldn't fire the new hire to bring in the perfect candidate.

Second, it harms your reputation.  You're essentially burning a bridge with the company and all coworkers you have burdened.  Even if you put in notice, you will still put a lot of burden on the company.  I believe this is a huge risk for an unknown job.

Of course, there are some good exceptions to quitting so soon:

* You're working at Walmart as a greeter and you just got an offer from Google as Lead Engineer.
* You discovered that the work environment is somehow intolerable, and you don't mind burning this bridge.
* It's a truly rare opportunity like a political appointment or a lead role in a James Cameron movie.
