PATTERSON: I'll be bait alone?
REDBEARD: Yes. And I'll be in some distant tree where I can provide no assistance whatsoever. Can you control your fear?
PATTERSON: I'll have to.
REDBEARD: I can't control mine- I'd be lost without the shame factor driving me.

REDBEARD: Good luck.
PATTERSON: Why?
REDBEARD: Because I think they're after you.
