KRISTINA: What are you doing here?
GEORGE: Nothing. I just wanted you to know I was out. I just wanted to see you.
KRISTINA: Well, here I am. See?
GEORGE: How are you doing?
KRISTINA: George, you just can't show up, tell me you love me, and have everything be okay.
GEORGE: Dad.
KRISTINA: What?
GEORGE: You can call me Dad if you want.
KRISTINA: I don't want, alright? It's not funny. I'm really pissed off, George. You blew it, now leave me alone.
GEORGE: Kristina, c'mon, I'm sorry. I'm going to make this right. I've got a few things going on...
KRISTINA: What do you want from me?
GEORGE: Just to walk with you. I want to be your dad again.
KRISTINA: Do what you want, it's a free country.
LEON: It's a four-man operation. Two on the ground. Two in the air.
GEORGE: Who's the co-pilot?
LEON: You're looking at him. We provide the plane, transportation cost, U.S. landing spot, and take it to wherever you want it to go. You provide the pick up point in South America, and are responsible for payment. You assume all the bust risks. We take sixty-five percent of all transportation fees, ten percent of the gross, plus our expenses. This is not a negotiation, so if this is okay with you, we can talk further. If not, we can forget we had this conversation.
GEORGE: Sounds fine. I'll need to meet everybody.
LEON: They're over at the booth.
