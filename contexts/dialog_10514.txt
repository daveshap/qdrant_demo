BO CATLETT: You understand I knew Harry was lying, saying this wasn't any good, but holding on to it, man, like you have to break his fingers to get it from him.
CHILI: That's funny, I was just wondering what I was gonna break of yours to get it away from you.
BO CATLETT: I'm just explaining to you what I'm doing here. Case you think I come to rob the place, rip off any of this dusty old shit the man has.
CHILI: I'd never make you as a burglar, not in that outfit.
BO CATLETT: Harry called you his associate, but what does that mean? I never heard your name or read it in Variety or The Reporter or anyplace.
CHILI: It's what he said, I'm his associate.
BO CATLETT: You must bring something heavy to the deal.
CHILI: That's right, me.
BO CATLETT: Says here you're getting Martin Weir for the part of Lovejoy.
CHILI: Yeah, we're getting Martin.
BO CATLETT: No shit, come on. How you gonna do that?
CHILI: I put a gun right here... ...and I tell him, 'Sign the paper Marty or your fuckin' dead.' Like that.
BO CATLETT: I wonder, would that work? You know who I see for Al Roxy? Harvey Keitel. The man could do it in his sleep.
CHILI: Harvey Keitel. Yeah. Maybe. He was pretty good in the movie Fingers"."
BO CATLETT: I missed that one. Or, hey, you know who else? Morgan Freeman. You know Morgan?
CHILI: Yeah, Morgan Freeman. But he's a colored guy.
BO CATLETT: So what? Where's it say in this script he's white? Color is what the part needs, man, somebody to do it has some style. The way it is now, Ronnie could do it, play himself, some cracked out asshole. So whatta you think of the script?
CHILI: Title's the first thing's got to go. And the guy's name. I mean, even this writer's name, Murray Saffrin is better than Lovejoy"."
BO CATLETT: I'm with you on that. And don't you think it needs a good female part? Increase the romance angle.
CHILI: There's Ilona.
BO CATLETT: What about her?
CHILI: Get something going there.
BO CATLETT: With Ilona? You know how old Ilona is?
CHILI: She's... young.
BO CATLETT: Young? She's fuckin' nine-years-old, same age as Lovejoy's kid. Bernie. One she calls Bernard. Have you read the script?
CHILI: Yeah, I read it. I was just thinking you could make her older. We might even be able to get Karen Flores.
BO CATLETT: Who?
CHILI: She's been out of movies a few years, but she's good. Real good.
