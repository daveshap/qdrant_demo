Where do I go from here?
It’s my second semester of grade nine, and since it’s my first year of high school I’ve been trying to settle in but a lots been happening. I’m a pretty below average kid, I have good literature skills and an ok natural voice, maybe some other minor intellectual skill as well but either than that I have nothing. I have ADD so studying and keeping consistent grades is a really difficult task, I’m not a sporty person either. I’m introverted which already whines off the idea of joining the band or drama club. Worst of all, however, is my friend situation. I got into some drama with one group I hung out with surrounding my crush so I’m kinda isolated from them, and my group of popular friends feel too awkward to be around, after seeing them smoke weed and stuff while I just was there with them. In summary, what I’m saying is I have no friends to hang out with and no skills to really count on. Does anybody have advice on what I can do to cope with the loneliness or maybe improve my situation?
