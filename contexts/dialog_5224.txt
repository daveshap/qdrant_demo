RICK: You're late.
RENAULT: I was informed just as Laszlo was about to leave the hotel, so I knew I'd be on time.
RICK: I thought I asked you to tie up your watchdogs.
RENAULT: Oh, he won't be followed here.
RENAULT: You know, this place will never be the same without you, Ricky.
RICK: Yes, I know what you mean, but I've already spoken to Ferrari. You'll still win at roulette.
RENAULT: Is everything ready?
RICK: I have the letters right here.
RENAULT: Tell me, when we searched the place, where were they?
RICK: Sam's piano.
RENAULT: Serves me right for not being musical.
