Today, at 22 years old and after years of panic disorder and anxiety, I applied to college for the first time.
I dropped out of high school at 17 due to consistent and debilitating panic attacks and thought I would never be able to go back. After two years in an academic upgrading course I am finally able to apply to college with a 90% average. Feeling so fucking proud. Donâ€™t give up. Ever.
