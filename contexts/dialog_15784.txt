YURI: Where have you been?
SERA: It was a slow night. I went to a hotel for a few drinks.
YURI: A full night on the street and this is all?
SERA: Like I said... it was a slow night... I'm sorry. It was hard to score.
SERA: Don't hit me.
YURI: What do you think... you are sixteen years old on Hollywood Boulevard?
