CARL: GOD. I'm beginning to lose faith in the United States Government and that includes the telephone system. Don't you folks talk to one another. That's her trailer there and I haven't touched a god damn thing. Agent Chet Desmond come by a second time and asked too see Deputy Cliff Howard's trailer ...which I showed him. I went back to my trailer... After that I never saw him again.
COOPER: Thank you, Carl.
CARL: That's not the way to Cliff's trailer. I told you.
COOPER: I am not going to Cliff's trailer.
CARL: Well, where are you going?
COOPER: I am going over here.
CARL: God damn, you people are confusing.
COOPER: What was here, Mr. Rodd?
CARL: A trailer was here. What the hell do you think?
COOPER: Can you tell me who's trailer it was... and who stayed in the trailer?
CARL: An old woman and her grandson.
COOPER: Can you tell me what their names were?
CARL: Chalfont. Weird. Chalfont was the name of the folks that rented the space before they did. Two Chalfonts.
COOPER: Is that Agent Desmond's vehicle?
CARL: Yep, it sure is.
