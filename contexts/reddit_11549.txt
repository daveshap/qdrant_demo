Is 17 years old too young to date a 22 year old? Is this a moral issue, a legal issue, what? So confused
A 17 y/o is showing interest in me but I'm 22. If she was 2 years older she'd be a good match. I'm just wondering if 17 is too young ? I don't think 5 years difference is a lot (think 20 y/o and 25 y/o). 

This is seriously really bothering me :(
