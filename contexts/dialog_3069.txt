IVY: I'm glad you came. I can't breathe without you.
ROBIN: I want us to be together. But I need to know you're serious about turning over a new leaf. I need a sign.
IVY: How about dangerous curves?
ROBIN: Of trust. Tell me your plan.
IVY: Kiss me and I'll tell you.
ROBIN: Tell me and I'll kiss you.
IVY: Freeze has turned the new telescope into a freezing gun. He's about to turn Gotham into an ice cube.
ROBIN: I've got to stop him.
IVY: One kiss, my love. For luck.
IVY: Bad luck, I'm afraid. It's time to die, little bird.
ROBIN: What do you mean?
IVY: You should have heeded your pointy- eared pal. These lips can be murder.
ROBIN: Then you never loved me?
IVY: Love you? I loathe your bipedal arrogance, your animal superiority. My only joy is knowing that even now my poison kiss is sucking the life from your ape-like face.
