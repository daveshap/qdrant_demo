HYPNOTIST: Okay, you're in your bed, Will. Now how old are you?
WILL: Seven.
HYPNOTIST: And what do you see?
WILL: Somethin's in my room.
HYPNOTIST: What is it?
WILL: It's like a small figure, hoverin' over me. Gettin' closer.
HYPNOTIST: You're in a safe place, Will.
WILL: It's touching me.
HYPNOTIST: Where is it touching you?
WILL: Down there. And I'm nervous.
HYPNOTIST: You don't have to be nervous, Will.
