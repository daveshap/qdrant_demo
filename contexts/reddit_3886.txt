I deleted all the dating apps
I have been going back and forth for years reinstalling tinder, deleting it redowloading mostly I think because I would start to get lonely but then I realized, I need to be with myself before I can attempt to find someone by flipping through like a magazine. It sucks that we have come to this type or dating; sitting in our rooms flipping through based on looks and a brief description. Also, I wouldn't mind going to bars or places like that but i also don't want a one night stand. What can we do as the youth to change this? Create another community? Any thoughts?
