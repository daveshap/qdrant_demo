JEREMY: She went into town with Mrs. Lutz. Did they get him?
PETER: No.
JEREMY: Feel like practicing?
PETER: Yeah. Just let me grab a shower.
FRANK: Where were you last night?
PETER: Are we going to go through this again?
FRANK: Answer the question.
PETER: I went out.
ANDY: Don't fuck with us! Where did you go!
KATHY: He was with me?
FRANK: What time did he get there?
KATHY: About a quarter to one.
ANDY: We're interested in where you were from the time you left the auditorium until you got there.
PETER: I was at the beach.
ANDY: You sure you weren't over on Pine Road?
PETER: I'm positive.
ANDY: You're a lying bastard!
PETER: Fuck you! I'm tired of your goddam accusations! If you want to arrest me go ahead! Otherwise back off.
ANDY: It's all a big game isn't it? A sick, fuckin' game. I don't know if there's two of you involved, or what -- but we're going to find out. Last night you gave us just enough to send us to the wrong place. It must've shocked the hell out to you when Frank walked in on Pine Road and you couldn't finish.
