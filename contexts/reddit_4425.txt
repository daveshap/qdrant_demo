It’s been two years since, I’ll hate myself forever over this
I can’t just get over the humiliation that my parents made me call this guy that rejected me (for an arranged marriage, because he didn’t like how I looked) and convince him to reconsider his decision. I remember pleading with him for close to an hour. I just stupidly followed the instructions and my (already abysmal) self esteem saw new lows. And he rejected me again. It comes back to me every night, I can’t seem to forgive myself for doing that to myself
