STEVEN: How many times do you want to hear this?
SHERIFF: Until I hear the truth.
STEVEN: I've told you the truth.
SHERIFF: The truth? That Josh, a man I've trusted with my own life on more than one occasion -- let me see if I've got the order right here -- tried to rape Diana...got the back of his head blown off...took a poker through the gut...fell through a plate glass window and then magically disappeared into the night.
STEVEN: I know what it sounds like.
SHERIFF: You don't know shit!
STEVEN: I didn't kill her!
SHERIFF: Then why were you at her house?! She didn't want anything to do with you.
STEVEN: She asked me to come over. She said she had something to tell me.
SHERIFF: About what?
STEVEN: About Jessica.
SHERIFF: That's a lie. Diana would never talk to you about Jessica. Not after what you did to her.
STEVEN: Look, I know I treated her bad --
SHERIFF: -- Bad?!
SHERIFF: You call what you did bad?! You knocked her up and then left her!
STEVEN: No -- she left me! After her miscarriage, I --
SHERIFF: -- Miscarriage?! Who the fuck told you Jessica had a miscarriage?!
STEVEN: She did!
SHERIFF: My God...you are one sorry son-of-a- bitch.
STEVEN: She did have a miscarriage, didn't she? Didn't she?!
SHERIFF: Oh, you stupid, sorry son-of-a- bitch...
