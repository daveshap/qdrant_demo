ZIMMERMANN: What can we do for you, officers? What new, mindless harassments have you planned this morning?
KITTLE: Just wanted to make you aware... before today's over, we'll be standing on top of your mountain of horse and pissing down on you.
ZIMMERMANN: Thank you for sharing that charming image.
NENA: Laugh it up. You'll cry later.
BILLY-BOY: You'll cry like a great big, blubbering baby.
