KATHRYN: Morning!
SEBASTIAN: Morning.
KATHRYN: So? How'd it go last night?
SEBASTIAN: With who?
KATHRYN: Well I know how it went with Cecile. She won't shut up about it. How'd it go with Mrs. Jesus?
SEBASTIAN: If your asking if I nailed her the answer is no.
KATHRYN: She shot you down.
SEBASTIAN: Exactly the opposite.
KATHRYN: So what went wrong?
SEBASTIAN: I don't know. She was lying on the bed, ready to do it, but I-- I don't, I was... I just didn't feel right about it.
KATHRYN: You're telling me you had the chance to fuck her and you didn't. God are you a chump.
SEBASTIAN: A momentary lapse of judgment, soon to be rectified.
KATHRYN: If you're heading towards her room, you won't find her.
SEBASTIAN: Where is she?
KATHRYN: You don't know? She left thirty minutes ago.
SEBASTIAN: Where'd she go?
KATHRYN: She wouldn't say. She apologized to your aunt and told her she was going to stay with some friends. You blew it, Sebastian. That girl has come to her senses and she will never go near you again.
