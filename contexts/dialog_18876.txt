VADA: Visualize a spare?
HARRY: Well you know what I mean.
VADA: So, what's on your mind?
HARRY: Me? What makes you think there's something on my mind?
VADA: You're passing up Archie Bunker to go bowling, you've gotta have an angle.
HARRY: No, I just thought it'd be nice if the two of us had an evening out so we could... talk.
VADA: Shelly's already told me all about sex.
HARRY: She told me too, I mean, she told me she told you about sex, I personally new about sex long before I met Shelly.
VADA: I figured you did.
