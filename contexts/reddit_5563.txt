Any thoughts on what my job title should be?
Hello, I was hoping I could get some suggestions to what my new job title should be. Recently, I had my yearly review and it was agreed that the title(s) that I use aren't accurate to what I actually do on the day-to-day basis. My company creates software for our clients and we also manage the customer service portion of how to use that software. I will detail a list of the responsibilities that I do daily. Please, any suggestions would be appreciated!

- Complete special Graphic Design projects for our clients, either as the lead or by myself (depending)
- QA various softwares that we create for our clients
- Be the point-of-contact for clients regarding their projects and any changes
- Follow and maintain workflow of the developers for the PM
- Data entry on various items
- Maintain an account of project status
- Special projects for the PM

My boss and I were discussing this and some ideas we were thinking were: Manager - Client Relations, Assistant Project Manager, Project Assistant?

Thanks in advance slight_smile
