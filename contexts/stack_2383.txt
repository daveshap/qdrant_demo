Can anyone explain some unfamiliar terms in PS Vita for a beginner gamer like me? So, I'm a grown-ass adult, but I've never played much game before other than on my phone. Since I'm on vacation and have a lot free time to spare, I'm looking to buy a PS Vita for gaming. However, I don't really know anything much about that stuff.  I know there are PS Vita and Vita Slim. But when I browsed a quite popular website in my country looking to buy 2nd hand PS Vita, I saw there were ads selling PS Vita 2000 from Japan for $160. What does the 2000 mean? Should I buy one that says it's from Japan? Is there another way to say psvista slim 3.68 jailbroken for $165. What does 3.68 mean? And the dumbest question, what does Jailbreak really mean? I saw that word all the time but never really understood it.TLDR; What do the following terms mean in regards to PS Vita/Vita Slim:20003.68Jailbroken
