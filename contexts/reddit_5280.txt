Fired because client complained about my sexuality
this is mostly a rant post, because it seems there's not much I can do.

so i was fired yesterday from my job because a client complained about my sexuality and the way i express it. I work in the education industry in Hong Kong, where there is no anti-discrimination law for LGBTQ. When I got to work yesterday, I was called to a meeting immediately, in which I was informed that a "VIP" parent complained about my sexuality. Apparently this parent somehow got hold of my instagram account (which I use a different name than my real name), and complained about the photos I posted. I concede that there is some "nudity" especially in my gay pride photos, but then that is just how i express my sexuality and my self, which doesn't affect my work performance. The HR and Manager informed me that my presence is seriously damaging the company's reputation, so they terminated my contract with immediate notice. They also emphasised that "it's not about the sexuality, but the photos themselves", as they consider how I express/perform my body is distinct from my sexuality.

The thing is that they are paying me full compensation, so according to Hong Kong labour laws there is not much I can do, as employer or employee can terminate contract any time if they abide by the Termination conditions of the employment contract. so yeah.....
