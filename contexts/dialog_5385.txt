CHUCK: Mom, this is a farm. We've got real strawberries growing outside, we've got real cream.
MOM: Oh no, the prodigal son's home. We bring out the store bought.
CHUCK: Maybe I should take a few days off. Roger's working now, you could use some help around here...
MOM: Don't you even think about it.
CHUCK: The place is falling apart.
MOM: I'm doing fine.
CHUCK: Doing great, Mom, don't worry about me.
MOM: There's settled folks, and there's nomads. You're just not a settled folk. You never belonged here.
