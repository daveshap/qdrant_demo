Ubuntu Server, Third Party Package Install I have installed Ubuntu server 16.04.3 LTS. I know that I could install a GUI package in order to simplify the problem of installing a third-party program/package/driver et. al. However, I much prefer the tty1 environment, especially since this particular blackbox is going to be used for research. Will anyone in the community either demonstrate or direct me to a step-by-step guide for downloading and installing a package from a non-specific or variable website?Thank you in advance to all those who may offer up insight.Edit: I want to get a package from a specific URL using the server interface: how do I download, unzip, and install the package?
