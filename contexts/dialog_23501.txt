WILL: She tells me to keep away. She is to marry Lord Wessex. What should I do?
VIOLA AS THOMAS: If you love her, you must do what she asks.
WILL: And break her heart and mine?
VIOLA AS THOMAS: It is only ours you can know.
WILL: She loves me, Thomas!
VIOLA AS THOMAS: Does she say so?
WILL: No. And yet she does where the ink has run with tears. Was she weeping when she gave you this?
VIOLA AS THOMAS: I â€¦ Her letter came to me by the nurse.
WILL: Your aunt?
VIOLA AS THOMAS: Yes, my aunt. But perhaps she wept a little. Tell me how you love her, Will.
WILL: Like a sickness and its cure together.
VIOLA AS THOMAS: Yes, like rain and sun, like cold and heat. Is your lady beautiful? Since I came to visit from the country, I have not seen her close. Tell me, is she beautiful?
WILL: Oh, if I could write the beauty of her eyes! I was born to look in them and know myself.
VIOLA AS THOMAS: And her lips?
WILL: Oh, Thomas, her lips! The early morning rose would wither on the branch, if it could feel envy!
VIOLA AS THOMAS: And her voice? Like lark song?
WILL: Deeper. Softer. None of your twittering larks! I would banish nightingales from her garden before they interrupt her song.
VIOLA AS THOMAS: She sings too?
WILL: Constantly. Without doubt. And plays the lute, she has a natural ear. And her bosom--did I mention her bosom?
VIOLA AS THOMAS: What of her bosom?
WILL: Oh Thomas, a pair of pippins! As round and rare as golden apples!
VIOLA AS THOMAS: I think the lady is wise to keep your love at a distance. For what lady could live up to it close to, when her eyes and lips and voice may be no more beautiful than mine? Besides, can a lady born to wealth and noble marriage love happily with a Bankside poet and player?
WILL: Yes, by God! Love knows nothing of rank or riverbank! It will spark between a queen and the poor vagabond who plays the king, and their love should be minded by each, for love denied blights the soul we owe to God! So tell my lady, William Shakespeare waits for her in the garden!
VIOLA AS THOMAS: But what of Lord Wessex?
WILL: For one kiss, I would defy a thousand Wessexes!
