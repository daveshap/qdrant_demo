Supporting two people on a grad student stipend: Does our budget seem reasonable?
I originally posted this on r/personalfinance but figured you guys may have some useful insights as well. 

Hubby and I are moving to San Diego this fall where I’ll be starting a PhD program. It is fully funded with a $34k (pre-tax) stipend, and I also will have subsidized housing through the university. I have no debt but he has $35k in student loans at 4.2%. We expect he’ll be making decent money once we move there, entry level jobs in his field are around $50-60k and the area’s job market is quite strong. We also have $20k in savings.

Our plan is to basically live off of my stipend and put most or all of his income toward debt payoff and savings/investments (and maybe the occasional vacation once his loans are gone). Here is our proposed monthly budget based solely on my income:

Income: $2833

Taxes: $300 (estimated based on an online calculator; I will not have to pay SS)

Rent: $1100 (includes utilities/internet)

Groceries: $500

Eating out: $100

Car: $0 (paid off, though it’s pushing 150k miles so not sure how much longer it will last)

Car insurance: $150

Gas: $75 (I will commute by bike, he will likely drive)

Phone: $50

Gym: $45

Health insurance: $0 (I’m covered by my university, he’s on his parents’ plan for the next year and hopefully his future job will offer insurance)

Fun/misc expenses: $300

Total expenses: $2620

Based on this budget we should have enough to live on via my stipend, with a bit of a buffer for unexpected expenses. His loans have a $200 minimum payment so we can always tap into our savings if he ever loses his job for a while. 

I’m not local to the area, so I’d like to know whether our proposed budget has any flaws or things that I’m forgetting? We are both very frugal and accustomed to living like broke college students, so I’m hoping this will be doable.
