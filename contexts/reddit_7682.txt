Should I Put the Grad School I Will Attend Next Fall on my CV?
I am a recent graduate attending graduate school next fall.  As of right now, I'm writing an application for a workshop I would like to attend, and they want my CV.

Should I put the graduate school I'm going to in the Education section of my CV, or leave it out until I officially start?

Edit: I realized my wording may not have been clear.  By "next fall" I mean Fall 2019.
