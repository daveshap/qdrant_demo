Should I teach one course while ABD?
I'm a 4th year candidate, and for this semester at least I have moved back to my home town to save money on rent (my school is in a large, and duly expensive city). I'm still fully funded and out of coursework. I was offered a chance to teach one course in my area at my alma mater here in Hometown. I understand that this is a lot of energy and effort -- and I've only been a TA for two semesters before now. My grad department and school are fine with it, since it's under 20 hours a week of work etc.. 

I want to say yes and take the opportunity, since it's extra $$$ and invaluable experience. But, I'm also dissertating. I'm in the humanities, and these next few months I don't have any upcoming travel obligations (for once). I realize that this is a highly individual decision, but...well, what would you all do?
