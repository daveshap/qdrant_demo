DULANEY: I love you.
MICHAEL: I love you too, Dad.
BIGGS: How you doin' Mister D?
DULANEY: Fine, Charlie. You familiar with the Marsh case?
BIGGS: Yeah -- I hear they had 'em a real dog and pony show going on up there - - I'll tell you, sometimes white people are a real puzzle to me. I mean, did this old guy really think he was gonna be able to keep up with a sweet little number like that?
DULANEY: It could've happened to anyone.
BIGGS: I'm sorry, man -- but I ain't ever heard of no brother dying from gettin' too much pussy.
DULANEY: We have to find out who else would profit from Marsh's death -- and who knew enough about his personal life to know that putting cocaine in the nasal spray would be fatal.
BIGGS: So -- where do we start?
DULANEY: I want you to hit all the dealers in town. Give them a list of people close to Marsh and see if any of them use. Then I want you to check out a Doctor Alan Paley. He lives up in Roseburg.
