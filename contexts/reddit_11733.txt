I cannot seem to be proud of myself for more than five seconds.
Recently quite smoking cigarettes about a month ago. Feels good, getting my air back. The gym is easier. These are good things. 

However, I still drink too much (daily, lots of beer) and went from smoking good weed to shitty weed because I am not currently working. I graduated college and started working temp jobs which was fine at first but now it's been over a year. Have had several long term assignments but they never wanted to hire me even though I work hard and am timely.

I have bad dreams about violence towards me and have little interest in others and am trying to get back into reading as a means of escape. I am young and seem to have lost interest in the opposite sex....other people in general I suppose. 

I can feel my world getter smaller and smaller and with all this time for sleeping I'm having nightmares about people being violent towards me, excessively tall buildings with little structural integrity, suffocation, rape, childhood home, and giant bodies of water.

I was given almost everything, I have no debt and no "real" concerns. I don't have to worry where my next meal is coming from so why do I feel this incredibly weight of failure even when, empirically, I'm doing pretty decently?

I am letting my writing go to shit out of sheer laziness. I feel like I am becoming less of a person every day. Just getting chipped away at by nothing.

God, that felt good.
