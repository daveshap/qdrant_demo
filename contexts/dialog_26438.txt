LEX: I'll be alright.
EVE: No, me, me, me. Thank you.

EVE: It's beautiful.
LEX: It has everything.
EVE: Wrong.
LEX: Why didn't you go before we left?
EVE: That was two days ago. Frankly, I think this place is a bit boring. It's all white. Why doesn't the guy put up some posters? Maybe some bullfight things . . .
LEX: It's beautiful.
