MULDER: What was it?
KURTZWEIL: When we were young men in the military, your father and I were recruited for a project. They told us it was biological warfare. A virus. There were rumors about its origins.
MULDER: What killed those men?
KURTZWEIL: What killed them I won't even write about. I tell you, they'd do more than just harass me. They have the future to protect.
MULDER: I'll know soon enough.
KURTZWEIL: What killed those men can't be identified in simple medical terms. My god, we can't even wrap our minds around something as obvious as HIV. We have no context for what killed those men, or any appreciation of the scale in which it will be unleashed in the future. Of how it will be transmitted; of the environmental factors involved.
MULDER: A plague?
KURTZWEIL: The plague to end all plagues, Agent Mulder. A silent weapon for a quiet war. The systematic release of an indiscriminate organism for which the men who will bring it on still have no cure. They've been working on this for fifty years. While the rest of the world was fighting gooks and commies these men have been secretly negotiating a planned Armageddon.
MULDER: Negotiating with whom?
KURTZWEIL: I think you know. The timetable has been set. It will happen on a holiday, when people are away from their homes. When our elected officials are at their resorts or out of the country. The President will declare a state of emergency, at which time all federal agencies, all government will come under the power of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. FEMA, Agent Mulder. The secret government.
MULDER: And they tell me I'm paranoid.
KURTZWEIL: Something's gone wrong -- something unanticipated. Go back to Dallas and dig. Or you're only going to find out like the rest of the country, Agent Mulder. When it's too late.
MULDER: How can I reach you?
KURTZWEIL: You can't.
