SYKES: ... and we work my hours. I'll do the driving, you do the paperwork. You gotta learn it so you might as well do it all.
JETSON: Sergeant... I'd like to thank you for what you're doing.
SYKES: What's that? Look, Jetson. Get this straight in your head. We're not pals, we're not married, and we ain't gonna take long moonlight walks together... We're just partners. And don't call me Sergeant. Call me Sykes... or Matt if you have to.
JETSON: I am George.
