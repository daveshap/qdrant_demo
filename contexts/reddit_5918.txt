From BA degree to AA degree to then pursue my passion
I hope what i'm posting goes here. I will take it down if it does not belong here.

Hi, i'm currently doing a BA degree in Mechanical Engineering in the University of Puerto Rico Mayaguez Campus and I am in my 4th year, 1st semester of study and I have 2 and a half years left.

I'm studying Mechanical Engineering because it can give me a better chance in living a comfortable life, but i'm getting tired of studying subjects that i cant decipher and feeling so alienated when hanging out with my classmates.

My true passion is drawing and getting to draw for concept art for a videogame company  or commissions, but studying art will cost me more compared to my current college which is cheaper and it doesn't provide decent courses.

I was thinking of finishing with a Associate's degree and work my way into practicing art and working a job to help me study art.

Would it be smart or convenient for me to finish with a Associate's degree and then find a job which will help me study and practice art?
