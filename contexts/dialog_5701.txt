LEONARD: We're all manipulated. From the moment we're born. The event that fatalistically shaped my life happened before I was even born.
JODY: Really?
LEONARD: Yes. We have no real freedom. You of all people should understand that. This may sting.
JODY: Me? Why me?
LEONARD: Because of your father. The way what his sins shaped you.
JODY: What do you know about my father?
LEONARD: He's a rapist. Like mine.
JODY: _ Your father raped someone?
LEONARD: Lisa Sherman was my mother. Do you know who that is?
JODY: Yes.
LEONARD: I was born nine months after she was raped. One of the four men who raped her is my father. I have no idea which one.
JODY: You're the killed.
LEONARD: Yes that's the whole point. This is what I was put on this earth to do. Rape the town that raped my mother. Steal its pristine innocence like it stole hers. I've planned this since I was a very little boy. You have no real freedom either. Your father has cast a shadow that you've never eluded.
MARK: You're so beautiful.
SANDY: So are you.
MARK: Now don't be nervous.
SANDY: You're the one who's hand is shaking.
NERD 2: Hey! That was a 3k machine.
NERD 1: Told you to hide it.
BEN: One more time.
CINDY: I get the imports.
BEN: Ok!
SHARON: You ok?
KENNY: Just thinking about something.
SHARON: What?
KENNY: There's going to be very few virgins left in school on Monday. It could be really dangerous for them if the killer isn't caught.
SHARON: I guess so. Luckily we won't have that problem.
SHARON: What are you doing?
KENNY: I got to go.
SHARON: What?
KENNY: I'm worried about someone.
