LESTER: Maybe he's just a kooky guy who likes doing something kooky like that.
FELICIA: Maybe... why do you ask?
LESTER: I'm thinking of investing with him. He worries me.
FELICIA: Why?
LESTER: Maybe he's too flighty and irresponsible. That's why I asked if he was a fairy.
FELICIA: I don't know. He's a hairdresser.
LESTER: You suggested it, don't you think it's a good idea?
FELICIA: Yes, but... I thought...
LESTER: What?
FELICIA: That you were just indulging me.
LESTER: No, doll, I listen to you. And if a deal loses money that's not so bad either if it's handled right.
