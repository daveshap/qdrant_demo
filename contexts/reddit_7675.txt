Asking too many questions already?
I have a committee for my upcoming Masters and I'm worried I'm already asking too many questions to my primary advisor. 

I don't want him to get annoyed with me even before I begin researching and at this point I'm just asking what classes he thinks I should take. 

Specifically he keeps mentioning the possibility of doing a research course but never explicitly tells me that he thinks I should take it. He is always vague with his answers when I ask, which leads me to ask the same questions again because I'm looking for a direct answer. In his last email he sounded annoyed and repeated information he already gave me so I just said thank you and ended the email thread. 

Then I realized that maybe taking this course is the only way I can work on my thesis which is why he suggested it, so now I'm thinking about asking questions about the timeline for a Master's thesis (I.e. when I should have a thesis proposal ready). 

Am I being too much? Should I already have asked these questions? Should I wait until I am actually at the school to start asking these kinds of questions? I'm honestly just trying to make the best decisions for myself so I don't fail or get overwhelmed like I did in undergrad.
