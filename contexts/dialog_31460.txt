WALTER: So, you're not a dyke.
VICKI: Not tonight.
VICKI: Hey, that was... intense.
WALTER: You're still here.
VICKI: I didn't say I didn't enjoy it.
WALTER: Of course. Sorry. I'm such a fucking asshole.
VICKI: No you're not.
WALTER: Don't tell me I'm not a fucking asshole when I know I'm a fucking asshole!
VICKI: What's the problem?
WALTER: You think I have a problem?
VICKI: Do you?
WALTER: It's been a while since...
VICKI: Since you've had sex?
VICKI: Tell me about it.
WALTER: Maybe later.
VICKI: How about in the morning.
WALTER: The morning?
VICKI: I thought I'd stay the night.
WALTER: What for?
VICKI: Well, Walter, this is going to sound off-the-wall, but I like to sleep with a man after we fuck.
VICKI: Did I say something wrong?
WALTER: I suffer from insomnia.
VICKI: Is that all?
WALTER: When I do sleep, I sweat a lot. Usually I get nightmares and wake up screaming.
VICKI: I sleep like a dead horse. Anything else?
