Hatred for seniors in TV Shows
As second semester has started, I have begun to watch lots of TV/movies and what I noticed (i.e Riverdale) is that they throw around acceptances to places like HYPSM as if all it takes is to be at the top of your class. I know it's fake, but it's kind of annoying the directors making it seem so easy (for example: "Dartmouth's my safety"). Prolly just another useless rant, but it kind of gets me frustrated w/ the message they give out.
