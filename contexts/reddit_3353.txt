Girlfriend just asked if I was ok with being in an open relationship.
I told her no, and when she asked why I told her because she will be fucking other guys, and she replied with “oh it won’t be that many”....

Right now I am feeling like I should 100% shut her out of my life now.

EDIT: Wow this post definitely blew up within a short amount of time...
Thanks everyone for commenting on this post and I will try to respond to everyone.

EDIT 2: Today we broke up and I took my self off of her phone plan. 
I wished her to be happy and she threw insults and plead towards me.
