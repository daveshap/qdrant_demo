At 21 years old I have finally shaken the intense, horrifying spell of anxiety and depression I'd had since I was 18. Now I just have to clean up the mess that it caused in my life.
For 3 years, I lived in constant fear. Constant pain. A horror i hadn't imagined possible until l lived it. Long story short, I found my way out. I figured out how to live again. The only issue is that now, at 21, I'm a college dropout with few friends and no marketable skills beyond speaking Spanish. The one thing weighing on me now is the time that I lost. 3 years of my youth that I'll never get back. I'd love to hear from anyone who has had a similar experience and has advice about overcoming thoughts of regret about time lost. Thank you.
