JERRY: You gave me an hour; now give me a day.
LIZA: Jerry, there's something I have to ask you. Actually about a hundred things, but we can make progress, if you answer one question. To my satisfaction.
JERRY: Shoot.
LIZA: It was that painting. The one on the wall.
JERRY: I didn't mean for you to see it. It's like looking in someone's diary and taking it out of context. Know what I mean?
LIZA: It made me feel like you could see inside of me. And I don't know how that's possible.
JERRY: So what's the question?
LIZA: How is it possible?
