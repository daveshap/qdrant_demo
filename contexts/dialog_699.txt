KORSHUNOV: Now since we've had very little luck getting Washington or Moscow to cooperate, I wondered if you would be so kind.
MARSHALL: Over my dead body.
KORSHUNOV: No. But since I only have a few of your staff left to kill, perhaps I will start with your family instead... Gibbs.
KORSHUNOV: The world is such a dangerous place and we can't always protect our children.
ROSE: Please. You can kill me but leave my daughter alone.
MARSHALL: She isn't a part of this. This is between you and me.
KORSHUNOV: Call up Petrov and order Stravanavitch' S release.
MARSHALL: This administration does not negotiate with terrorists.
KORSHUNOV: Pity. Mr. Gibbs.
