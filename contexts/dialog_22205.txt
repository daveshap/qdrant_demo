WELLES: All men love. But men like Hearst -- they don't bother with convention because--
MANK: They don't have to.
WELLES: He loves in his own way. On his conditions. Because those are the only conditions he has ever known.
WELLES: Hearst looks down at the world at his feet Everything has always been beneath him.
MANK: And what does he see?
WELLES: The people. When they pay him homage, he adores them. But when they have the ... audacity to question him. To doubt him. To embarrass him. Then he despises them.
MANK: And when he looks up? What does he dream about?
