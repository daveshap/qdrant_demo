What Jobs are at risk to automation AI? How to prepare?
Well, guess this is a fairly straight forward question. What jobs are at most risk to automation by AI and software programs? How do you prepare to keep up with industry change in your field? What field do you work in? I work in the financial services in IT and keep up on my analytical skills, learning new software packages and trying to keep on top of the curve and valuable to my current (and future) employers.

How many jobs do you think can and will be replaced by AI / Automation or even products: EG touch displays for cashiers.
