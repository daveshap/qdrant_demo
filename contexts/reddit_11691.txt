So I might have just impregnated my girlfriend...
It's not entirely a bad thing though. Its just we've only been dating a few weeks. Fortunately she's my best friend and I've known her for 10 years. Unfortunately we played a dangerous game and lost.

I fucked up big time. Mentally we are both ready, financially not. My one (maybe) saving grace is she has internal problems with her eggs. Her periods are irregular and she and her ex were trying to have kids before they broke up. So she might not get pregnant.

And that sucks because I love her. I plan on marrying her in the near future. But she might not be able to have my kids. That sucks because I always envisioned myself with kids. We're almost 30 and its time to have kids of our own. No matter what though, I'm going to see it thru.

We'll see in 4 to 6 weeks...
