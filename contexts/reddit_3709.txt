Word of advice for mothers on dating apps
I don't know if I am the only guy who feels this way, but if you are a single mother please don't only put up pictures of your children. Whether that be of your human children or fur babies (as I've heard them called before). While I have no qualms with being in a relationship with a mother, it can be quite off-putting when your profile is filled with images of your children and little to none of you. It's also a little weird "liking" a profile of nothing but 5 yr olds...  One or two images of you with your children is perfectly fine, but please have some in there of just you as well.
