I just learned my local library can also get me free passes to museums & art sites in my city. That immediately expands my list of cheap date activities! Libraries are magic, don’t forget to check what your library can do for you.
This is apparently a new thing, so it’s good to check in and see if they’re adding services. The Mütter museum in Philadelphia is cool but tickets cost $20 per person. Meanwhile I can “check out” a free pass for two people at 3 different libraries near me!
