I donâ€™t want to live without him
Itâ€™s been 8 years since my fiancÃ© was murdered in a robbery gone bad and I wish I could say Iâ€™m better but Iâ€™m not. Iâ€™ve hated my life every moment of every day since he left. I hate this world for taking him from me over something so stupid. I was born to a family that doesnâ€™t love me and everyone has treated me like shit except him and now I have to live the rest of my miserable life without him. Iâ€™ve prayed for the courage to end it all. Iâ€™ve tried every single antidepressant available and it only makes things worse. The worst is discussing it with others because they always try to force me to date someone else and move on but I donâ€™t want anyone else. The thought of being with someone else makes me feel sick. Iâ€™m not over my fiancÃ© and I never will be. I think I was pregnant by him around the time he died but miscarried due to stress. I donâ€™t want to live with this pain anymore. Iâ€™m never going to love someone like that or be loved like that again. I will never marry or have a family. I will never watch my kids graduate high school or meet my grandchildren. My life is a waste and means nothing. I wish someone would shoot me in the head too ðŸ˜­
