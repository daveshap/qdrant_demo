Getting bored of explaining yourself on dates?
Dates with different woman, to find that  perfect one.. is anyone else’s just tired of repeating the same thing to everyone?
“ I work at so and so.. my hobbies are so and so.. my fav shows are ...” that repetition gets annoying and boring!! It’s so much work and effort having to repeat it all haha
