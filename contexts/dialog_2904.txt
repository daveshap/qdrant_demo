AN I.A. MAN: There's no smoking in this building.
NICK: What are you gonna do -- charge me with smoking?
LT. WALKER: I'll ask you once, Nick -- for the record did you kill him?
NICK: No.
NICK: Come on -- I'm going to storm into his office in front of everybody in the afternoon and then that night I'm going to kill him? I'd have to be really dumb to do that.
AN I.A. MAN: Going after him before gets you off the hook for killing him that's your alibi.
