MARY PATRICK: We did it! We actually sang a chord!
MARY ROBERT: That was exciting!
CHRISTY: Yeah, for one second. That was the blend -- you've got to listen to each other. Be a group.
MARY LAZARUS: I knew that.
CHRISTY: Mary Lazarus, I get the feeling that you like discipline. Hard work.
MARY LAZARUS: Of course. I'm a nun. Four Popes now. The Lord hates a loafer.
CHRISTY: I hear you. How many days a week do you rehearse?
MARY PATRICK: Two days. An hour or so.
CHRISTY: No way. We're a choir, right? Headliners. The big room. Two days a week won't cut it. Every day.
