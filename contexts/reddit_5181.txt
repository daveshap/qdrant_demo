Got offered a job, and then the company changed their mind
I applied for this job, interviewed and was offered a position. Gave them my availability, told them I would change my availability at my other job to fit this one, and begin filling out all of the necessary paper work. Today I got a call from them saying that they’re not going to offer me the position anymore (but they look forward to seeing my application again in the future). Luckily my manager was still there, so right after I finished the phone call, I walked to the back, and told my manager to ignore the new availability sheet I gave him. It sucks because I was excited to get into the company because I would like to eventually have a career there once I finish school, however though, I don’t know how to feel about it now since they offered me a job, had me do all of the paper work, only to tell me that they’re no longer offering me the position , and then having the audacity to tell me that they look forward to seeing my application again in the future
