DOLORES: Good morning, Wanda. Hi, Hartley.
WANDA: Hi, Dolores.
WANDA: What do you think?
DOLORES: Well, it's certainly what you'd call interesting.
WANDA: You hate it.
DOLORES: I didn't say that.
WANDA: I could wrap it up. Protect the other kids.
DOLORES: I'll just strap it on the roof.
WANDA: It's for the school bazaar.
DOLORES: Oh, it's bizarre alright. C'mon Bear. Let's get you out of here.
WANDA: Away from your crazy Mom.
DOLORES: The Ottos always waited for the bus with Bear. They were the only parents who did that, together like that. I guess they're what you might call hippies.
