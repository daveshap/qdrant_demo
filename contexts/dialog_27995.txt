LOUISE: What happened to your hair?
THELMA: Nothing. It got messed up.
LOUISE: What's wrong with you?
THELMA: Nothing. Why? Do I seem different?
LOUISE: Yes, now that you mention it. You seem crazy. Like you're on drugs.
THELMA: Well, I'm not on drugs. But I might be crazy.
LOUISE: I don't think I wanna hear what you're gonna tell me.
