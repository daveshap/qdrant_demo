Short story about a man who accidentally travels back in time with his car I'm trying to recall a short story I read somewhere in 2017-2018, most likely in an issue of The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction published between 1980 and 2012.The story was about a man who gets in his car - I believe coming back from work one day - but when he starts driving, he discovers that he is moving backwards in time. I recall a scene where he goes into a store to buy something, with his money from the future, and hopes that the clerk doesn't notice anything wrong. (IIRC, she doesn't.)I think he was driving on a bridge at some point.It's quite possible that I'm conflating this part with another short story I read around the same time, but if I'm not wrong, he goes to meet up with a childhood friend of his when he reaches the time that they were kids. He might even have seen himself? I think he buys one of them - either the friend or himself - a drink.At the end, I believe that he just decides to keep driving and see what happens, coming to the conclusion that there's no way for him to reverse what had happened.
