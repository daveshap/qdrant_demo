I want to quit my job to avoid exposure to covid, but fear loosing a good reference.
I have worked at a grocery store chain for the past 8 years, I have been a hard worker, gotten raises, and was offered to be a dept manager, but schedule wouldn't work for my family.   


Lately I was working less anyway to help care for my daughter.  I was out for a while but I have to go back next week, but don't feel comfortable working due to covid.  But I fear that if I quit I may lose a good reference from my manager, and the last 8 years of hard work will be for nothing when I am ready to to rejoin the workforce after covid.    


What do you think?  Do you think employers would be understanding of quitting a job during covid or do you think they would frown upon it?
