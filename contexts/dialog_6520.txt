WOMAN: Put in the Kevin Costner.
PETER: Why don't we save it for later? It's almost time for Letterman.
WOMAN: You know I don't like to watch talk shows by myself. Where're you?
WOMAN: See, now you've annoyed her. You know she doesn't like you to touch me. Does she, widdle wee fing! Wuhve you so much! Did you feed her?
PETER: Yes, I fed her. If she says she's hungry, she's lying to you. Again.
WOMAN: She doesn't lie! You sure you fed her?
PETER: She lies all the time. Why would I say I fed her if I didn't?
WOMAN: That's what I don't know. Why would you lie? That's the problem... I can't understand why anyone would lie.
