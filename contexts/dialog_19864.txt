LORETTA: ...How'd you sleep?
BELL: I don't know. Had dreams.
LORETTA: Well you got time for 'em now. Anything interesting?
BELL: Well they always is to the party concerned.
LORETTA: Ed Tom, I'll be polite.
BELL: Okay. Two of 'em. Both had my father. It's peculiar. I'm older now'n he ever was by twenty years. So in a sense he's the younger man. Anyway, first one I don't remember so well but it was about meetin' him in town somewheres and he give me some money and I think I lost it. The second one, it was like we was both back in older times and I was on horseback goin' through the mountains of a night.
