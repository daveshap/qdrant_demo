Feeling dumb at the gym
I feel super dumb in the gym because i’m overweight. I just stare at the floor because I feel so much shame and sadness about my body. I’m trying to be better and get healthy but it really bothers me when I have to go run on a treadmill in public with other people around all probably thinking that they’re glad they’re in better shape than me or that i’m a fat embarassment. Getting healthy is such a slow burn, a painful humiliating process but there’s no other way around it. I only have myself to blame. I just feel really embarassed and it bothers me!
