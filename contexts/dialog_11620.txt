KAGGS: Good to have you back, Roy. I was just looking at --
ROY: Mr. Kaggs, I'm sorry.
KAGGS: You're turning me down? Makes no sense, Roy.
ROY: I guess I'm just not a leader of men.
KAGGS: Oh, come on, Roy.
ROY: The truth is, Mr. Kaggs --
KAGGS: Perk, remember?
ROY: Okay, fine. Perk, the truth is, I like things the way they are now. Pick my own hours, have time for, uh, other activities...
KAGGS: A well-rounded life. I respect that. But it has to have a center, Roy, something you care about, something you can think about.
ROY: Maybe I'm just not ready for that yet.
KAGGS: Well, Roy, if that's the way you feel, I won't badger you. Don't want to lose you as a salesman, too.
ROY: Oh, I'd like to stay on. Just keep everything the way it was.
KAGGS: That's what we'll do, then. But I tell you what, Roy. Before I hire anybody else, I'll ask you one last time. Fair enough?
ROY: Fair enough.
