Who presides over the senate and what does that entail?
The United States Constitution provides that office of Vice President of the United States "shall be President of the Senate, but shall have no vote, unless they be evenly divided" [Article I, Section 3.](https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/constitution-transcript)  In case of the absence of the Vice President it provides for the office of President Pro Tempore. 

In 1961 Lyndon Johnson, then serving as Vice President, moved his office from the Capitol to the White House and shifted his focus to executive branch functions and left the determination of who commonly presides over the Senate, for all intents and purposes save tie breaking votes, to the Senators, as they are responsible for electing the President Pro Tempore.

What, exactly, does presiding over the Senate entail? 

Does anything, other than relatively recent tradition, prevent the Vice President from fulfilling this constitutionally prescribed role more regularly? 

How do these roles, President and President Pro Tempore, interact with the Senate Floor Leaders in terms of agenda setting and calling for votes on bills?
