EVE: I don't suppose there's a drink left...
ADDISON: You can have one at Max's.
EVE: I don't think I'm going.
ADDISON: Why not?
EVE: Because I don't want to.
ADDISON: Max has gone to a great deal of trouble, it's going to be an elaborate party, and it's for you.
EVE: No, it's not. It's for this.
ADDISON: It's the same thing, isn't it?
EVE: Exactly. Here. Take it to the party instead of me.
ADDISON: You're being childish.
EVE: I'm tired. I want to go home.
ADDISON: Very well. I shall drop you and go on to the party. I have no intention of missing it...
EVE: Who are you?
GIRL: Miss Harrington...
EVE: What are you doing here?
GIRL: I - I guess I fell asleep.
GIRL: Please don't have me arrested, please! I didn't steal anything - you can search me!
EVE: How did you get in here?
GIRL: I hid outside in the hall till the maid came to turn down your bed. She must've forgot something and when she went to get it, she left the door open. I sneaked in and hid till she finished. Then I just looked around - and pretty soon I was afraid somebody'd notice the lights were on so I turned them off - and then I guess, I fell asleep.
EVE: You were just looking around...
GIRL: That's all.
EVE: What for?
GIRL: You probably won't believe me.
EVE: Probably not.
GIRL: It was for my report.
EVE: What report? To whom?
GIRL: About how you live, what kind of clothes you wear - what kind of perfume and books - things like that. You know the Eve Harrington clubs - that they've got in most of the girls' high schools?
EVE: I've heard of them.
GIRL: Ours was one of the first. Erasmus Hall. I'm the president.
EVE: Erasmus Hall. That's in Brooklyn, isn't it?
GIRL: Lots of actresses come from Brooklyn. Barbara Stanwyck, Susan Hayward - of course, they're just movie stars.
GIRL: You're going to Hollywood - aren't you? From the trunks you're packing, you must be going to stay a long time.
EVE: I might.
GIRL: That spilled drink is going to ruin your carper.
EVE: The maid'll fix it in the morning.
GIRL: I'll just pick up the broken glass.
EVE: Don't bother.
EVE: How'd you get all the way up here from Brooklyn?
GIRL: Subway.
EVE: How long does it take?
GIRL: With changing and everything, a little over an hour.
EVE: It's after one now. You won't get home till all hours.
GIRL: I don't care if I never get home.
EVE: That's the door.
GIRL: You rest. I'll get it...
ADDISON: Hello, there. Who are you?
GIRL: Miss Harrington's resting, Mr. deWitt. She asked me to see who it is...
ADDISON: We won't disturb her rest. It seems she left her award in the taxicab. Will you give it to her?
ADDISON: How do you know my name?
GIRL: It's a very famous name, Mr. deWitt.
ADDISON: And what is your name?
GIRL: Phoebe.
ADDISON: Phoebe?
GIRL: I call myself Phoebe.
ADDISON: Why not? Tell me, Phoebe, do you want some day to have an award like that of your own?
