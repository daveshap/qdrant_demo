ABDULLAH: You don't know all that has happened here- the Devil has come to Tsavo.
REDBEARD: You're right. The Devil has come. Look at me. I am the Devil.
ABDULLAH: I am a man of peace.
REDBEARD: Am I to take it you want to live?
ABDULLAH: Most certainly. Absolutely. Yes.
REDBEARD: Excellent decision. Your name is Abdullah? I'm sure we'll meet again. Go and enjoy the splendid morning.
ABDULLAH: I think it's been a pleasure.
