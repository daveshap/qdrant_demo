ALMÁSY: Madox will have calculated how many miles, they'll soon turn around.
KATHARINE: Oh my God, the others!
ALMÁSY: Could I ask you, please, to paste you paintings into my book? I should like to have them. I should be honored.
KATHARINE: Of course. Is it, am I a terrible coward to ask how much water we have?
ALMÁSY: Water? Yes, we have water, we have a little in our can, we have water in the radiator which can be drunk. Not at all cowardly, extremely practical. Come on, come on! There's also a plant - I've never seen it but I'm told you can cut a piece the size of a heart from this plant and the next day it will be filled with a delicious liquid.
KATHARINE: Find that plant. Cut out its heart.
