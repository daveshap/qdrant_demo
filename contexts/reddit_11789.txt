I got offered some good things in my life, now I'm having a nervous breakdown
My current job is great--I feel fulfilled every day, I get along with my coworkers, and I feel like I'm contributing positively to the office. The problem? I get paid in the 1st percentile of people who so the kind of job I do. (Basically: the median pay for this kind of work is 66k a year, I get paid 18k.)

I got offered a job that is 35% higher pay, has similar benefits, and honestly just looks like a better opportunity in general.

I have the job offer paper in front of me. and I'm just unable to call the numbr and officially accept the position.

I hate change, I am already depressed, and I am terrified of uncertainty.

I don't know what to do. There is no intelligent reason NOT to take the job. But I just can't and I know it's just my anxieties getting in the way--it's not an instinctual "bad feeling".
