SUZIE: You didn't tell me you were gonna put me on the fucking news.
GLORIA: We need to tape the interview, Suzie. No one will see it but us. Now when was this, that Mr. Lombardo gave you the ride?
SUZIE: About a year ago.
GLORIA: He dropped Jimmy off first?
SUZIE: Yeah.
GLORIA: And when he arrived at your house, was anyone there?
SUZIE: No.
GLORIA: So you were alone.
SUZIE: Yes.
GLORIA: Did he come in with you?
SUZIE: I guess.
HUNTER: You guess? Did he or didn't he?
SUZIE: Yeah... okay... he did
HUNTER: And then what... he touched you? Did you maybe flirt a little...
SUZIE: I wanna go home now.
