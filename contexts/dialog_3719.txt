DECKARD: Six, huh?
BRYANT: Five. Three nights ago one of them managed to break into the Tyrell Corporation. Killed two guards and got as far as the Genetic Sector before he got fried going through an electro- field.
DECKARD: What was he after?
BRYANT: There wasn't much left of him, so we can't be sure. But bio- chemical data and morphology records of the Nexus-6 were reported missing. Going on the possibility they might try to infiltrate we send Holden in to run Voight-Kampff tests on the new employees. Guess he found himself one.
DECKARD: You got a machine on it yet?
BRYANT: We're using Esper -- a 231 -- that picked up Holden's alarm. Its guess is that all five are in the city.
DECKARD: Where do we start?
BRYANT: The Tyrell Corporation has a demo model. Check it out on the Voight-Kampff. There's a chance the Nexus-6 is beyond out ability to detect. If that's the case, everybody's up shit creek.
DECKARD: What was the cover on the one that got Holden?
BRYANT: Industrial refuse.
DECKARD: Garbage man?
