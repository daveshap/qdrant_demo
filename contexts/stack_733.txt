Network not working properly after restart notebook closed lid I have a notebook on remote location, the notebook has closed lid and from time to time I would like to restart it, but when I do the network doesn't come up, only after the lid is opened.Second problem and maybe connected is that when the  is closed and no one is logged in into desktop (ssh is not enough) the notebook suspends.So is there a way how to prevent the notebook from suspending even when no one is logged in and also somehow ensure that the network will reconnect after reboot.
