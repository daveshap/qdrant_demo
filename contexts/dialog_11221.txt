KIP: Yeah ...
MEMPHIS: You all right -- ?
KIP: I think so. There's things I can't feel right now. Like my feet. But ... You think you can get me outta this, Memphis? I'd appreciate it -
MEMPHIS: Just hold-on there --
KIP: This has nothing to do with any of that --
MEMPHIS: Oh. You maybe have more than one enemy who owns a car-crusher -- ?
KIP: All my enemies own car crushers. It's like a pre-requisite ... Owwww...
MEMPHIS: Easy ... Take it easy ... We're almost there...
MEMPHIS: You okay -- ?
KIP: Totally. I'm fine. You want a beer, man -- ?
MEMPHIS: Sure --
