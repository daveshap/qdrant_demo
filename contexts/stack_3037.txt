Do antiparticles behave opposite of the particle? If antiparticles have opposite charge to that of the particle, will their interaction be completely opposite?For example, an electron and a proton are attracted to each other, will a positron and a proton repel each other?Similarly if a proton is repelled by another proton, will an antiproton be attracted to another proton?
