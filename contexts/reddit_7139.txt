How to navigate performance reviews at a startup
**tl;dr: I want to get the most out of a formal performance review at a startup, both in feedback and compensation increase, how do I do that?**

Hello r/jobs, I wanted to get your opinion on formal performance reviews at startups. I've had some exposure to this process at a previous employer, but that employer was much larger (~7000 employees, compared to 20-30) and the review process was significantly more established.

For some background, this is my second job out of school and a little over 3 years into my career. I've been at this startup for roughly 1 year 3 months, and no review or compensation increase has occurred yet. This review coming up is the first formal attempt to do so.

I have a title of "Lead *something, omitted for privacy* Engineer", and feedback has generally been informally very positive for my performance. I am wondering how to both prepare for a more formal review, and how to get the most out of it, specifically for gathering as much feedback as possible and approaching it with intelligent questions.

Also, I am in the dark as to what to expect in terms of a compensation/equity increase, and how much I can reasonably fight for.

Any comments and suggestions are appreciated!
