All I see is my hands
I feel weird because all I do is look at my hands, i just stare at them and I sink into this pool of thoughts that only relate to my existence. like how I am here right now and everything is happening and I’m essentially experiencing nothing and it’s all so quick. I was coloring in first grade and now I’m 19 and my heart is racing because tomorrow I’ll be forty and in a week I’ll be dead and not know it, never knowing I was ever alive but you’ll be there driving past my grave living your life and I’ll be a tomb in the corner of your eye that will only ever be the background stroke in an infinite painting. I know that while I glide across the canvass now soon my stroke with cease and one day another soles paint will brush over me and when the world looks at yesterday’s portrait They’ll never know I was the color purple, and I’ll only ever be the texture for someone else’s green. I think about when forever ends, because its only for existence and one day my existence will end and while I know what that will be like, when I think about it it scares me. I’m I love, I’m a son, an employee, I’m a thousand things to the world and one day I’ll be nothing, not even a mind in a dream limbo I’ll just be nothingness. I don’t know how to stop looking at my hands. Every wrinkle and scratch, each movement and pulse, I’ll always only ever see my hands and life will never notice they were there, I wanna forget I exist and just exist, I just wanna stop looking at my hands..
