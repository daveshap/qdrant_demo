Furlough Situation.
Quick question for you folks. I hope everyone is well. 

Furlough may be the way forward for my organisation and they are basing it on "utilisation" statistics. 

Although I am highly paid and qualified, My work is very efficient and I am notorious for it. The Company has invested heavily in me over the last few years. Due to this reason my utilisation statistics are pretty low in comparison to others "less senior, less qualified" and this is mainly down to the time taken to complete a task for example. 

Ultimately it's the Companies decision and If I need to find another job, So be It. 

My question: Is this a justifiable means of furloughing people or even judging someone's performance based on this metric alone ? 

Interested to hear what opinions you have to offer. 

Thank you!
