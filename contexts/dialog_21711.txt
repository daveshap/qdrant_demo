MAN: Where'd you get the stag hound?
FLORENCE: He's not a stag hound. His name is Kelly and he's a police dog.
MAN: What do you mean police dog?
FLORENCE: Plain-clothes man. Come on, slaves, drink and be merry for tomorrow you might be appointed correspondent to Washington ... a fate worse than death.
MAN: Listen, Flo, cut it out. Hard-Tack is pretty sore.
FLORENCE: Ain't that something. The mad monk of Manhattan. Here goes nothing. Listen to the animal cracker roar like a lion.
