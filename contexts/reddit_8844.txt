Is a city making its own money legal? If legal, what are the pros and cons of doing this?
There is an [article](https://news.trust.org/item/20200709101434-84sxx) going around about a small town in Washington state that has made its own wooden money.  

[Article 1, Section 10, Clause 1 of the United States Constitution says](https://constitution.congress.gov/browse/article-1/section-10/) "No State shall enter into any Treaty, Alliance, or Confederation; grant Letters of Marque and Reprisal; **coin Money; emit Bills of Credit; make any Thing but gold and silver Coin a Tender in Payment of Debts;** pass any Bill of Attainder, ex post facto Law, or Law impairing the Obligation of Contracts, or grant any Title of Nobility." (Emphasis added)

Is this legal, or does this fall afoul of that provision?  

Assuming it is legal, what are the pros and cons of doing this?   Do we have any historical examples besides [company scrip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Company_scrip) which became [illegal in 1938](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrip) with the [FLSA](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/29/531.34)?
