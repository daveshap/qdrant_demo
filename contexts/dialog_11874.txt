LAURIE: Now I want you to change your clothes, Tommy. We're going to take a walk outside.
TOMMY: Was it the bogyman?
LINDSEY: I'm scared!
LAURIE: There's nothing to be scared of now. Get changed.
TOMMY: Are you sure?
LAURIE: Yes.
TOMMY: How?
LAURIE: I killed him...
TOMMY: But you can't kill the bogyman.
