ARNAUD: Good evening ... Can we pass?
SOLDIER: It's too late. No one is allowed to enter the Casbah at this hour. It's impossible.
ARNAUD: But it's not even midnight yet!
SOLDIER: It's ten minutes past midnight. Curfew begins at midnight.
ARNAUD: Please, we just want to take a short ride. A friend of mine has never seen the Casbah.
SOLDIER: I'm sorry. Tomorrow. Tonight is out of the question.
