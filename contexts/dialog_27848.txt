CLEMENZA: Outside.
PAULIE: Sure.
SONNY: Clemenza. You take care of Paulie. I don't ever want to see him again. Understood?
CLEMENZA: Understood.
SONNY: Okay, now you can move your men into the Mall, replace Tessio's people. Mike, tomorrow you take a couple of Clemenza's people and go to Luca's apartment and wait for him to show. That crazy bastard might be going after Sollozzo right now if he's heard the news.
HAGEN: Maybe Mike shouldn't get mixed up in this so directly. You know the old man doesn't want that.
SONNY: OK forget it, just stay on the phone.
