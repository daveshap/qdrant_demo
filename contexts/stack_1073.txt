How to change priority of program in system monitor? I'm trying to change priority of processes so the games I play have a higher priority for performance reasons, but I cant figure it out how to that. I've done some searching and found that you have to change the programs \"nice\" value (or something like that), however I always get lost and confused when following their explanations.
