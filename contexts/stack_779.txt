Create a new document and rename it directly (in one step) in Ubuntu 18.04 I know this is some how silly and ridiculous, but it is really annoying!<br>I recently installed Ubuntu 18.04.. With Ubuntu 16.04, I was able, when I create a new empty document, to rename it directly: I didn't need to :  step1:  create the document.step 2: click on it with the right button and choose rename Everything was done in one step.<br>However, in Ubuntu 18.04, I can not do this (creating and renaming) in one step: every time I want to create an Empty document, I have to:Create the empty documentRight click on it then choose rename.Is there anyone who faced the same problem? And is there a fix for this?PS: It is not about how to create an empty document in Ubuntu 18.04, it is about how to create and rename, in one step, an empty document.
