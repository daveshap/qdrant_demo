What are some 'MUST DO's' when leaving a company?
So, After weeks of anxiety, interviews, and emails, I finally accepted an offer at a new company. I just gave my resignation and 2-week notice on Friday. I expect I'll spend the next two weeks cleaning/packing, annotating my open tickets, etc.

What are some other things I should make a point to do? specifically, what are some things I wouldn't think of, or overlook?

UPDATE: After I put in my notice and signed my offer and contract, I just got called today, saying that my offer is still contingent on a background check.. I'm not exactly worried about it, (I currently hold a secret clearance), BUT my credit is kinda shitty. now, I'm back to anxiety-city.
