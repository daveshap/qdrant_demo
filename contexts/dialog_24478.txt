KABUO: Sheriff said right off, I was under suspicion. I didn't have a lawyer...
HOOKS: But even <u>after</u> you had an attorney. You still claimed to know <u>nothing</u>. Claimed <u>not</u> to have seen Carl. Am I correct?
KABUO: Yes. Initially.
HOOKS: Well, 'initially' is an interesting word, sir. You'd <u>been</u> arrested, you <u>had</u> a lawyer, and you <u>still</u> claimed ignorance!
KABUO: I should have told everything right away. I know that now, and I regret it.
HOOKS: Should have told 'everything'. Meaning, you should have told the <u>truth</u>.
