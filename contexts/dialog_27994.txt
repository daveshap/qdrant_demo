HAL: Honey?
SARAH: Yes, baby?
HAL: Do you think you could ever shoot someone?
SARAH: What?
HAL: Do you think you could ever think of a set of circumstances that would just cause you to haul off and shoot someone?
SARAH: I could shoot your cousin Eddie.
HAL: Why?
SARAH: Because he's an inconsiderate asshole.
HAL: I'm asking you seriously, Sarah, a stranger?
SARAH: I don't know, honey. I guess it would depend.
HAL: On what?
SARAH: Well, maybe if they were trying to hurt you or one of the kids. I'm sure I could shoot someone if they tried to hurt one of the children.
HAL: Yeah, I could too. But... I don't know why I'm even asking you this. It's just... we can't place anybody at the scene but these two gals that everybody swears is sweet as pie. I don't know. I keep hearing words -- impossible -- inconceivable. If just one person would say...
SARAH: Honey. Nothing's impossible. You just don't shoot someone like that for no reason. Maybe he was askin' for it. Anyway, somebody's husband probably got ol' Harlan.
HAL: That's what everybody says. Only problem is nobody's husband was unaccounted for that night... Could you shoot Eddie in the face? At point blank range?
SARAH: In the leg.
HAL: I gotta go to Little Rock.
