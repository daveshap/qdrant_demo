ROSE: What?
MARSHALL: I miss you. And I miss her.
ROSE: But that's the point, Jim. We're right here.
MARSHALL: I wish it were that easy...
MARSHALL: I'll make it up to you, I promise.
ROSE: I should trust that promise? Because you know the voters are still waiting for that middle class tax cut.
MARSHALL: This promise isn't subject to Congressional approval.
ROSE: How did your speech go?
MARSHALL: Well, they aren't burning me in effigy. That's always a good sign.
