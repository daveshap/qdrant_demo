Single word for all knowledge? I'm looking for a word that means all human knowledge.Preferably, the word would be a noun and could refer to knowledge abstractly, inclusive of that which is written and not. It means all that which is known, not that which is not yet known, or can never be known. (The unknown unknowns.)To clarify, I mean only all known knowledge.This excludes encyclopedia as a word.In context:\u201cAll knowledge\u201d is like a balloon in space. The more it fills with gas, the more it touches on the void: the unknown. Such is the paradox of \u201call knowledge\u201d.
