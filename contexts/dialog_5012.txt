BUFFY: Just stay away from me, okay?
MERRICK: Did you ever dream that you were someone else?
BUFFY: Everybody does.
MERRICK: In the past. A girl. Maybe... A Magyar peasant. An Indian princess. A slave.
BUFFY: I was a slave.
MERRICK: In Virginia.
BUFFY: I don't know. It was... There was a big gram or something. And there's one, I'm like a prostitute...
MERRICK: China.
BUFFY: Oh, my God. I never told anybody about this. I remember the one about the peasant, too. God, there's a bunch. Is this, like channeling or something.
BUFFY: I had a dream once where I was... There was like, knights in it, and I worked in this bar. And I... was fighting. I'm always fighting. And there's a guy... He's not always there, but he's horrible, all white, and he's always... trying to kill me.
MERRICK: Lothos.
BUFFY: How do you know all this?
MERRICK: I have to show you.
BUFFY: I can't believe I'm doing this. I can't believe I'm in a graveyard with a strange man hunting for vampires on a school night.
MERRICK: Why didn't you ever tell anybody about your dreams?
BUFFY: Oh, yeah, tell everyone I'm crazy. Beauty ida.
BUFFY: Ow.
MERRICK: Cramps?
BUFFY: None of your business. God.
MERRICK: This is it.
