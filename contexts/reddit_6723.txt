Do you bother with firms that have a bad reputation on the review websites?
So I get contacted through job websites but as it stands most firms who approach me have worrying reviews online. The last job I took had all points listed on a review that were problematic for me as well so I feel like I should listen more to those reviews. Yet again maybe I should see for myself. Basically I don’t want to waste my time but I’m also unemployed. How do you go about it?

For reference, the last firm to contact me sounded interesting as it actually matched my qualifications. But from the reviews the culture is hell, pay is low, people are leaving. There are no follow ups from the company on those reviews, no „we’re sorry you feel that way and constantly striving to be better bla bla“. Looks to me like they don’t care and just cram in new graduates like me who supposedly don’t know better.
