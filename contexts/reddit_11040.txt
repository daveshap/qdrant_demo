A note from the quiet kid in the back of the class
Yes, we exist.
Please stop making jokes about us shooting schools, we would never do such a thing. We're just shy.
We want friends but social interaction is fucking impossible for us in whatever scenario. A compliment will do. So will opening a conversation about whatever game we're playing at the time instead of doing our schoolwork.

We are capable of being normal.
Without other people around. This is why Discord exists, people.


This has been your daily talk.


Edit: I did not expect this to blow up.
