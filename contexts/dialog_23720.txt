BETTS: ...probably nothing at all. It's probably just a bunch of, I don't know, fatty cysts. You can have them removed in a doctor's office. Has Nick seen a doctor?
JANINE: He hates doctors. Doctors and lawyers. He never goes to doctors.
BETTS: Well, look. How's this? You go on down to the clinic and tell that nice Dr. St. Luc... ...you tell him that Nick's ill, he's got these lumps, and he can't get out of bed. Tell him to come when you're sure Nick'll be home. And don't tell Nick anything. Let the two of them fight it out.
JANINE: He'll be really mad.
BETTS: So? You'll find out what's wrong and then you'll be able to relax a little bit. Let him be the uptight one for a change.
