Got Fired, looking for advice
Hi, so here is a brief run down on why I was fired from Taco Bell: One day, I tried to clock in, but the system said I was terminated, so I worked 3 hectic hours (because he was busy on phone calls) before I told my boss that the system said I was terminated. He told me to just go home because 27 people were randomly removed and he would need to get me back in the system. So I wait 24 hours and text him. No response. I text him again... and call. No response. I came in today thinking I had the wrong number when the manager told me I was fired. He said the reason was because during the time I was working , I apparently took 3 fake 20 dollar bills and add that to the fact I was already accident;y terminated. Here is some background info: It was my 4th day working cash register (probably 5th at Taco Bell) and there was twice as many customers as normal because of broken drive thru. Also, I was never told or trained to check 20 dollar bills at all -- I was only told to check for fake 50s and 100s.

Should I complain or do something about getting fired for this? I have had friends who have lost more money and kept their jobs.

TLDR; Lost 60 bucks from register and got fired despite being extremely new and not being trained to check for fake 20s. Should I complain to corporate and do something or is this common in fast food jobs?
