DISRAELI: The cartoon or Her Majesty's absenteeism?

DISRAELI: My dear Stanley, a Prime Minister with only a handful of friends must respect public opinion.
DISRAELI: Gossip counts. Lord Aberdeen was right. This country is not governed by wisdom but by talk. Granted, it wouldn't take much to winkle the old girl out of mourning, but if public opinion is against her, then it doesn't do to appear too close.
STANLEY: So?
DISRAELI: We'll see which way the wind blows.
