Who to send a follow up email to: the decision maker or committee?
I had my first interview at my dream job back in June with the search committee. I had the second round interview with the three people who “make the decision” since they’re the higher ups a couple weeks later.

The second interview group - Vice Chancellor, Head of the Unit, potential supervisor - said they are hoping to make an offer in two weeks.

It’s now two weeks and I plan on following up next week during week 3. My struggle is do I email the three I interviewed with during the second round and 1) make the hiring decision 2) told me they will be making an offer in 2 weeks and 3) I sent a thank you email to? OR do I send it to who I’m 95% sure is the committee chair but who I haven’t had any interaction with since my first interview a month ago when I sent my thank you email to the committee?  OR do I ask the woman who called me to set up the second interview and who I gave my reference waiver to? OR do I just send it to all of the above?

I’m not sure what’s appropriate and what’s not.
Any help would be greatly appreciated!!

Update: ended up sending it to the most senior person who interviewed me and the admin who’s be consistently involved. Send the email on Friday and as of today (Wednesday) I hadn’t heard back. I called HR and they informed me that position was offered to someone else and that I should be hearing from someone soon. 😕

Thanks for the feedback!
