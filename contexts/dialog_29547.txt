HEATHER: Hi, guys, what you been up to?
VAL: Ran into the new college student, Rona.
EARL: Rhonda. Rhonda LeBeck. She's getting some kind of strange readings on her things.
BURT: Damn, you know, those kids turn up oil or uranium or something out there...next thing the Feds will be at our door. Sorry
HEATHER: Down, honey, down.
VAL: Yeah, Burt. The way you worry, you're gonna have a heart attack before you get to survive World War III.
PHAM VAN: Hey Val, listen. Bearing going out, you think?
VAL: Could be.
EARL: Catch it later, Pham. Gotta get over to Nestor's.
VAL: Right. We plan ahead. That way we don't do anything right now. Earl explained it to me.
BURT: A beauty, isn't it? We bought three of them for the rec room.
VAL: We sell 'em to you for three bucks a piece!
PHAM VAN: And I appreciate it.
VAL: You don't get it, Pham. The idea was: we were ripping you off.
