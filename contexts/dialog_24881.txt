BUZZ: Yeah, and make it extra muddy, I didn't sleep a zee last night. Sheila fills a cup. Buzz lifts it to his mouth, his hands trembling.
SHEILA: You don't need coffee, Mr. Fazeli; you need a vacation. Sheila catches sight of Theo pulling into the parking lot. She puts a Ken head earring in her right ear. Buzz follows Sheila's gaze.
BUZZ: Some people will do anything for an autograph. Theo enters the diner and walks over to Buzz.
THEO: Millie left to stay with her sister in Ronkonkoma.
BUZZ: You know what a mixer ball is? It's like you, you come out of nowhere and upset things, scattering everything all over. Buzz grumpily waves at him to sit.
THEO: What are you doing over at the lanes that's so dangerous, Buzz?
BUZZ: You shouldn't listen to her, she's a nervous old Nellie.
THEO: She thinks someone's trying to kill you.
BUZZ: I couldn't pay someone enough to try to kill me. Sheila comes over to take their orders.
