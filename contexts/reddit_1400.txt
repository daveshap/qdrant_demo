Increased anxiety/ruminating thoughts when your life isn't as busy?
Does anyone else have increased anxiety, especially ruminating thoughts, when you're not "busy" with life and have too much time on your hands? How do you deal with this? I've been seeing a therapist lately and through our discussions about my anxiety she has pointed out that it seems like my anxiety is at its worst when I'm not busy at work, not busy dating people or seeing friends, no extracurricular activities etc.

I used to love the idea of staying home and relaxing but not anymore.
