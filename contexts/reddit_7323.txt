No training at new job.
I'm a technician in a start up company that was created in 2015, so far in the past 2 months, I learned that there's no training or documentation of any sorts(schematics, inventory list, build of material, quality), we are financially struggling and that got my monthly pay delayed for 14 working days. I asked my family and they insist that this company is testing me for some reason I don't comprehend yet.

Is it really normal for companies not to have training or documentations?
