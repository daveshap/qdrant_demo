VAUGHN: I'm showing summer rentals. We got a helluva season going.
BRODY: We have got to talk, and we have got to talk alone.
VAUGHN: We're alone.
BRODY: Larry, I don't know how to say this, but I think we got a shark problem. A real one.
VAUGHN: Are you serious?
BRODY: Of course. Look -- I've got some missing persons, fatalities, evidence of a large predator....
VAUGHN: No one has seen a shark -- no fin, no bites, nothing. Be realistic.
BRODY: I got a feeling. I have to act on it -- you can understand that, can't you?
VAUGHN: Of course I can, but can't it wait? These things cost money, and this town doesn't have much money.
BRODY: We have to do something.
VAUGHN: We have done something -- hell, we damn near went broke putting up a shark watch tower on the beach -- it's the only one in 2000 miles, y'know.
BRODY: I know, I know....
VAUGHN: And I stood by while you told the people from Ramada and Marriott that if they put up a hotel they'd need $800,000 worth of steel net around their beaches! In New England? We all lost on that one.
BRODY: It's still a good idea.
VAUGHN: Martin, when we build up our tax base a little, you can have every- thing you want; right now, the town's broke.
BRODY: Please, Larry -- there's good reason. Those water skiers....
VAUGHN: A tragedy. But that was a boating accident; no bites, no sharks, nothing but a boating accident.
BRODY: Two of them are still missing!
VAUGHN: There's always deaths in these waters that never turn up. Are they all shark victims?
BRODY: Maybe they are!
VAUGHN: Bullshit.
BRODY: Bullshit? I'll give you bullshit -- there's a dead whale out there with bites all over it!
VAUGHN: What am I, an ass? When you called me, I called Elkins, and her bosses. Nothing she saw is proof of anything.
BRODY: Someone has to do something.
VAUGHN: Don't push it this time. If you do, it won't turn out the way you want, I guarantee you that.
