GEORGE: I'm thinking about getting out of town this week. You want to come with me?
KRISTINA: Where are you going?
GEORGE: I don't know. Maybe California.
KRISTINA: You swear?
GEORGE: Yeah. Go out there, check it out, see what it's like. I've got some stuff to do this week, but I'm thinking maybe Thursday. Thursday after school.
KRISTINA: You know I can't. Mom will never let me go.
GEORGE: You let me take care of your mother. You just pack your bags.
KRISTINA: But I've got school.
GEORGE: There's schools in California.
KRISTINA: You swear?
GEORGE: That's right. Three o'clock. Thursday. At your mother's. You and me. It's a date.
KRISTINA: I don't believe you.
GEORGE: I swear. On my life.
KRISTINA: Swear on my life.
GEORGE: I swear on your life.
KEVIN: Are we good?
GEORGE: Are we good? Yeah, we're good. We're beautiful. We're perfect. This is A grade, one-hundred percent pure Colombian cocaine, Ladies and Gentlemen. Disco shit. Pure as the driven snow. Good riddance.
GEORGE: You saved my life, Dulli. You'll never fucking know. All you guys. Everyone just got a raise. Instead of ten percent, you get fifteen.
LEON: Jesus, George, fifteen percent. That's an extra two-hundred large.
GEORGE: I don't give a shit. Split it up. Have a great life. I'm done. I'm out. Starting over. Cheers.
