Depression is getting worse
So I've been stuck inside now for almost a week, I'm always so tired and every little thing seems trivial. I've been trying to keep my self occupied with crafts but everything seems to suck and no matter how hard I try I just look at my work and think I can't do one thing right. At this point i just wish I could go to work but I live with my 80+ year old grand parents and my fiance has only 80% function in his lungs due to scar tissue. If they get sick I know I'll blame myself and so I've had to take all this time off work. I feel worthless pathetic stupid and whiny for posting this. I'm really not trying to get attention I just am asking for some help. What do you guys do at times like this and I'm I just bitching? I honestly can tell but it feels like I am. Anyway I've ranted enough, if anyone has advice please let me know.
