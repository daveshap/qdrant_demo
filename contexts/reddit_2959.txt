I’m pushing 30. How can I learn a trade or a skill? UK
I’m 29 and feel I’ve sat behind a desk too long and allowed my comfort zone to get the better of me.
Me and my partner are moving to Manchester in the next couple of months and I see this as a great opportunity to kickstart a career change and learn something that will open doors and last me throughout my working life. 
Any career guidance or words of wisdom would be greatly appreciated!
