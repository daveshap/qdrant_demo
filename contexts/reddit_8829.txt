How does the Philippines' potential "separation" from the US affect the power dynamics in Asia and the dispute over the South China Sea?
After more than a year of souring relations, Philippine president Rodridgo Duterte publicly [announced his "separation" from the US last week:](http://edition.cnn.com/2016/10/20/asia/china-philippines-duterte-visit/)

> "America has lost now. I've realigned myself in your ideological flow," he told business leaders in Beijing on Thursday. "And maybe I will also go to Russia to talk to Putin and tell him that there are three of us against the world: China, Philippines and Russia. It's the only way."

This shift is largely seen as revolving around the [South China Sea dispute,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Territorial_disputes_in_the_South_China_Sea) which has China claiming a large portion of the area, while neighboring nations of Brunei, Taiwan, the Philippines and Vietnam have disputed the claim. Regional players like Japan, the US, Australia and South Korea have also [expressed concern.](http://www.news.com.au/world/asia/should-we-be-concerned-about-the-east-china-sea-dispute/news-story/b6313eaaa407927b9969525d530e9feb)

In July, an UNCLOS tribunal ruled against China, which does not acknowledge the tribunal and rejects its ruling. Immediately afterwards, it looked as though China might be diplomatically isolated, but with the Philippines now potentially aligning with China, and Brunei, Cambodia and Laos quickly supporting China in the dispute,](http://www.morningnewsusa.com/south-china-sea-dispute-asean-falters-brunei-cambodia-laos-side-china-2384010.html) the situation is looking far more balanced. In addition, [Russia and China ran joint naval exercises in the region](http://edition.cnn.com/2016/09/12/asia/china-russia-south-china-sea-exercises/index.html) just last month.

With the Philippines presumably realigning itself, what leverage do the concerned nations like the US, Japan and Taiwan have to ensure continued free navigation through the South China Sea? With China now having the support of various neighboring nations and the Russian military, are its territorial claims over the disputed areas a *fait accompli*? Is a regional realignment towards China now inevitable? What can the various players do to reduce tensions?
