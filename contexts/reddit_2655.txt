My boss told me there was no growth for me at the company. After putting in my notice, they posted a job position in a position one-rank above me. Advice?
I have worked at this job for almost two years. When I first began my career here, they were incredibly encouraging that I would have career growth and development. Throughout the two years, my boss kept saying they were either going to hire someone alongside me or a manager (for reference, I'm a marketing coordinator. I have no marketing manager. Just a Director of sales, marketing and business development). I was told about six months ago that unless I wanted to move into sales or business development, I would have no career advancement there. Thus, began my job search and found another similar marketing role with a clear growth path.   


After putting in my notice, my boss was very kind and understanding, and said "Congratulations! I'm sorry we don't have a career path for you."  Just this morning with a week left in the role, I get a call about someone asking for contact information for the marketing manager job opening. I knew nothing about this and mentioned I didn't, just directed them to apply online.

Part of me is hurt, humiliated and angry. I don't want to just walk out and be petty, but I wish I didn't find out like that. Part of me wants to mention all of this in my exit interview and ask our recruiting manager why there wasn't this opportunity for me. Any career advice would be appreciated.
