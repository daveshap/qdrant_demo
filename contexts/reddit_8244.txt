Brexit Megathread
#The United Kingdom has voted to leave the European Union.

---

Highlights:

* The UK has voted to leave the EU, with voters in England outside of London being the bulk of the Leave vote.  Wales was very closely split with a slight lead for Leave.  Northern Ireland was also close with a slight lead for Remain.  Scotland was strongly for Remain.

* Global markets have been shocked by the news, and stocks are down markedly around the globe.  The British pound has had its single largest fall in at least the past four decades and is at levels not seen since 1985.

* The vote begins a negotiation period between the United Kingdom and the European Union over the terms of departure which may last up to two years.  The UK may seek to retain access to the common market, but it is not assured that can happen.

* Prime Minister David Cameron has vowed to resign his office by October.  He had been a vocal proponent of "Remain" but had called the referendum based on a campaign promise to do so.

* There are substantial calls for Scotland and possibly Northern Ireland to consider referenda on leaving the United Kingdom.  Scotland recently voted to remain in the United Kingdom in 2014 by about a 10 point margin in favour of staying in the UK.

Polls have shown a very tight vote with maybe a small edge to Remain.  In betting markets, Remain has a pretty big edge.

This royal throne of kings, this scepter'd isle,

This earth of majesty, this seat of Mars,

This other Eden, demi-paradise,

This fortress built by Nature for herself

Against infection and the hand of war,

This happy breed of men, this little world,

This precious stone set in the silver sea,

Which serves it in the office of a wall,

Or as a moat defensive to a house,

Against the envy of less happier lands,

This blessed plot, this earth, this realm, this England,
