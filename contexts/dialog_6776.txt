GILES: I thought it was you. It's the hair!
JACK: I'm working on that soccer story.
GILES: Right. Look, I must get back to Habib.
JACK: Habib?
GILES: My author. He's a Terrorist. He's written a kill-and-tell book. Take care.
GILES: Jack, look, next weekend I'm having a house party. Here... It's near Oxford. Why don't you come? It'll just be social. No business. Bring a friend. I've plenty of room.
JACK: I'll try and make it.
GILES: Looking forward!
