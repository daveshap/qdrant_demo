ubuntu not booting! Well thanks a lot everybody for help. I played around with my computer and installed Ubuntu in UEFI. I have never seen such an energetic forum. But now, there is another problem. Sorry :PNow in my boot menu I have 3 options:Windows boot managerLinus something. I figured out, it only appeared if when my bootable usb was plugged.ubuntuWell, a good new before, i successfully installed ubuntu and it asked me to reboot. When I did so and clicked on the 3rd option, it booted into windows. When i clicked 2 and tried to use try without installing, it says \"Unable to find a medium containing live file system\"What should i do?Thanks in advance and sorry for bothering u guys
