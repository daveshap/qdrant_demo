How to replace the currently selected text in Applescript? How does Devontechnologies WordServices' do it? Devontechnologies offers a collection of services that let's the user perform some common tasks on text (upper case, lower case, ROT13 and so on). They do it without (as far as I can tell at least) using the clipboard (pbpaste/pbcopy).I have googled a lot about this but the only solutions I have found are based on pbcopy/pbpaste and I want to avoid that. Any suggestions?I am creating my own service similar to Devon's WordServices that takes an editable piece of text, manipulates it and finally replaces the original text.
