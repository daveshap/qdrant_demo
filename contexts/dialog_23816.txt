MAYA: So what gems do you have in your collection?
MILES: Not much of a collection really. I haven't had the wallet for that, so I sort of live bottle to bottle. But I've got a couple things I'm saving. I guess the star would be a 1961 Cheval Blanc.
MAYA: You've got a '61 Cheval Blanc that's just sitting there? Go get it. Right now. Hurry up...
MAYA: Seriously, the '61s are peaking, aren't they? At least that's what I've read.
MILES: Yeah, I know.
MAYA: It might be too late already. What are you waiting for?
MILES: I don't know. Special occasion. With the right person. It was supposed to be for my tenth wedding anniversary.
MAYA: The day you open a '61 Cheval Blanc, that's the special occasion.
MILES: How long have you been into wine?
MAYA: I started to get serious about seven years ago.
MILES: What was the bottle that did it?
MAYA: Eighty-eight Sassicaia.
MILES: Wow. We gotta give it a moment, but this is tasty. Really good. How about you?
MAYA: I think they overdid it a bit. Too much alcohol. Overwhelms the fruit.
MILES: Yeah, I'd say you're right on the money.
MILES: Is this Stephanie's kid? Sure is cute.
MAYA: Yeah, Siena's a sweetie.
MILES: Is she sleeping or...?
MAYA: She's with her grandmother. She's with Steph's mom. She spends a lot of time over there. Steph's... well, she's Stephanie.
