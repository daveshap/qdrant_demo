Better. I am better.
Just wanted to put it in writing. I played football today and studied well. I am meant to be dead but I stayed. Introduced meditation exercise and immense focus on my thoughts. 

This is a war but I am starting to win a lot more battles. I donâ€™t see this as the end, but the beginning of something better.
