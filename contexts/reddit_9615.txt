New Academic Advisor, Looking to Improve Office Space
Hey everyone, 

I was recently hired as an Academic Advisor and Coach, and I want to make my office space welcoming to the students I'll be working with. What elements of an office space have worked for you or have you admired about a colleague/mentor? What kinds of signs/posters? Did they have stress balls? Snacks?
