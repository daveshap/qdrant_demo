JUD: Poor Missy. God, I was sorry to hear. I remember when she was no older'n Ellen there, walking down to the store with her Raggedy Anne doll draggin' behind her in the dust. I don't know why God takes someone like her, who should have a bunch of years still in front of them, and lets an old shit like me just go on and on.
LOUIS: My father used to have a saying, Jud-- God sees the truth
JUD: Ayuh...how is your cat, Louis?
LOUIS: It's Ellie's cat.
JUD: Nope. He's your cat now.
LOUIS: Ellie? What's wrong?
ELLIE: No more chocolate chip cookies.
LOUIS: Huh?
ELLIE: Missy made the best chocolate chip cookies in the world--even Mom said so. Now there won't be any more because she's gonna be dead forever!
