Can an employer discipline for social media?
My coworker is in several Facebook groups made up of installers in our same industry who all work for different companies. We have some products in common, and it has been a good place to find tips and support from other people who have hands-on experience.


He made a post about an issue we have noticed with a product that originates in our company. He asked the group if anyone else had seen the same issue. Within minutes, our manager came and told him to take the post down, because it had caused a "big uproar" at corporate. They are talking about disciplinary action because he was "bad-mouthing" our products on social media.


Is there a legitimate case for discipline here? I did a Control+F on our employee handbook .pdf and "social media" isn't anywhere in there
