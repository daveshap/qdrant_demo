Life is shit and we all know it, I wish I could stop existing
Life is a meaningless piece of shit. I hate everyone and everything. Life is so fucked and unfair, and yes people say "But you are not doing this, you're not doing that, you feel like shit, because of yourself and all that crap.", but let me tell you something: I've been doing everything that people have been telling me such as consistently working out, running, creating a schedule, affirmations, self-help books which are worthless and doesn't help, take a walk, listen to podcasts, doing nofap, etc.

Nothing is helping and I don't want to live. The only reason I'm still alive is my new friends, they're my only inspiration, besides I don't give a shit, this world is full of crap. I'm tired of existing, it's so painful and meaningless, and maybe I'm lashing out right now and start to cry, but it feels good. Sorry all you people who've read it.
