REGGIE: Well, of all the mean, rotten, contemptible, crooked --
CRUIKSHANK: Crooked? I should think you'd be glad to find out I wasn't crooked.
REGGIE: You couldn't even be honest about being dishonest. Why didn't you say something?
CRUIKSHANK: We're not allowed to tell. May I have the stamps, please?
REGGIE: Here -- Wait a minute -- how did Carson Dyle get an office in here, anyway?
CRUIKSHANK: When did you see him -- what time, I mean?
REGGIE: Around one.
CRUIKSHANK: The lunch hour. He probably worked it out in advance. He found an office that was usually left open and just moved in for the time you were here.
REGGIE: Then how do I know this is your office?
CRUIKSHANK: Mrs. Foster -- send a memo to Bartholomew at Security recommending that --
REGGIE: Bartholomew?
CRUIKSHANK: -- recommending that all Embassy offices be locked during the lunch hour.
REGGIE: Starting with his own.
CRUIKSHANK: Okay, now -- hand over those stamps.
REGGIE: What's your first name today?
CRUIKSHANK: Brian.
REGGIE: Brian Cruikshank -- it would serve me right if I got stuck with that one.
CRUIKSHANK: Who asked you to get stuck with any of them?
REGGIE: Is there a Mrs. Cruikshank?
CRUIKSHANK: Yes.
REGGIE: But you're -- divorced?
CRUIKSHANK: No.
REGGIE: Oh.
CRUIKSHANK: My mother -- she lives in Detroit. Come on now -- give me those stamps.
REGGIE: Only if you can prove to me that you're really Brian Cruikshank.
CRUIKSHANK: How about if next week some time I put it on a marriage license -- that ought to --
REGGIE: Quit stalling -- I want to see some identification -- now!
CRUIKSHANK: I wouldn't lie on a thing like that -- I could go to jail.
REGGIE: You'd lie about anything.
CRUIKSHANK: Well, maybe we'd better forget about it, then.
REGGIE: You can't prove it, can you? You're still trying to -- marriage license! Did you say -- ?
CRUIKSHANK: I didn't say anything. Will you give me those stamps?
REGGIE: You did too say it -- I heard you. Oh, I love you Adam -- I mean Alex -- er, Peter -- Brian. I hope we have lots of boys -- we can name them all after you.
CRUIKSHANK: Before we start on that, do you mind handing over the stamps?
