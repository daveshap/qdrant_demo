PHILIP: We'll shoot this with an .18, boys.
SHELLY: That bugger moves fast.
PHILIP: Give me a 400-foot magazine; we may be down there for a while.
SHELLY: I wouldn't mind going down with her.
PHILIP: She is a lovely bit of crumpet at that.
IKE: Aren't you suiting up, mate?
MIKE: No.
IKE: Well, don't worry about your fiancee. We'll watch over her.
MIKE: She can take care of herself. She doesn't need you.
IKE: Never know down there. Helps to have a friend, sometimes.
MIKE: How many sharks have you killed?
IKE: Me? I don't know. Twenty, thirty. I love them, think they're the greatest.
