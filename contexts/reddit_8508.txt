Would Turkey Be Justified in Kidnapping or Drone-Killing Fethullah Gulen in Pennsylvania?
Good morning everyone. I lifted the subject of this discussion directly from [an article by Glenn Greenwald that appears this morning on *The Intercept.*](https://theintercept.com/2016/07/18/would-turkey-be-justified-in-kidnapping-or-drone-killing-the-turkish-cleric-in-pennsylvania/) 

To summarize- in this article Greenwald argues a kind of moral equivalence between the United States' use of military drones to kill suspected terrorists in the ME and a hypothetical action by Turkey to assassinate Fathullah Gulen in Pennsylvania. (Gulen is the cleric Erdogan claims is responsible for Friday's failed military coup in Turkey. He has been living in the USA since 1999, despite repeated requests by Erdogan that he be extradited.)

Greenwald concludes his article with a harsh rebuke of what he describes as an American "pathology":

>U.S. drone kills of terror suspects (including its own citizens) are extremely popular among Americans, including (in the age of Obama) those who self-identify as liberal Democrats. Yet itâ€™s virtually certain that Americans across the ideological spectrum would explode in nationalistic outrage if Turkey actually did the same thing in Pennsylvania... 

> Indeed, so ingrained is this pathology that the mere suggestion that the U.S. should be subject to the same laws and rules as everyone else inevitably provokes indignant accusations that the person is guilty of the greatest sin: comparing the United States of America to the lesser, inferior governments and countries of the world.

So clearly this is a pretty provocative piece of writing, which not only touches on the news of the day but also addresses a persistent undercurrent in the national debate regarding how the United States should prosecute the offensive against terrorists abroad. 

Here is some background reading that might be helpful:

And I guess that's it. I found this to be a pretty interesting question and I've been mulling it over all morning. What do you guys think?
