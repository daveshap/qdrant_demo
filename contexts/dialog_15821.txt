PAULETTE: After you went to all that trouble?
ELLE: Well, what am I supposed to do? He's engaged! She's got the family six- carat on her bony, unpolished finger.
PAULETTE: You're asking the wrong girl. I'm with my guy eight years and then one day it's I met someone else. Move out.""
ELLE: What'd you do?
PAULETTE: Cried a lot and gained twenty pounds. Dewey kept the trailer and my precious baby Rufus. I got jackcrap.
PAULETTE: I didn't even get to go to his birthday party.
ELLE: No!
PAULETTE: What could I do? He's a man who followed his pecker to greener pastures. I'm a middle- aged high-school dropout with stretch marks and a fat ass. Happens every day. At least to women like me.
ELLE: That's terrible!
PAULETTE: So, what's this Sarah got that you don't? Three tits?
ELLE: She's from Connecticut. She belongs to his stupid country club.
PAULETTE: Is she as pretty as you?
