JENNIFER: What happened to his tooth?
FRIDA: I should call the police. Oh no Peter. Peter is the police!
JENNIFER: DON'T call the police.
FRIDA: Why not? There's been a murder.
JENNIFER: First of all, you're my alibi. I told George I was with you last night.
FRIDA: What? Why'd you do that?
JENNIFER: There's kind of this guy I'm seeing.
FRIDA: You're cheating on George? Jennifer, how could you?
JENNIFER: How could I? I'm helping you clean up Mark's remains and you ask how could I cheat on George?
FRIDA: You're right. It's just, I can't cover up a murder so George won't know you're cheating.
JENNIFER: You say murder, but you have no idea what happened. You don't remember doing it, so it's out of your control.
FRIDA: I think I turned into a werewolf and killed him.
JENNIFER: Why the fuck would you do that?
FRIDA: I could smell another woman on him.
JENNIFER: If you ask me, the fucker got what he deserved. I'm glad he's dead.
FRIDA: That's a terrible thing to say. Frida goes back to scrubbing the floor.
JENNIFER: Okay, let's say that this is PMS- related. You think those male cops are going to understand that? You'll either be locked up for murder or locked up in the looney bin. We have to keep this hidden until we figure it out ourselves.
LLOYD: Nah, East Village poseur was grosser than the dude in the park.
PETER: The park dude was missing an arm.
LLOYD: Poseur was missing a chunk of his neck. And his eyes were open. That always bugs me out. Do me a favor, if some mutherfucker's about to blow me away, remind me to close my fuckin' eyes.
PETER: Deal. And if some mutherfucker's about to blow me away, shoot him.
LLOYD: Yeah okay. I still say Frida's involved. She's the last one to see two dudes alive...
PETER: She wasn't the last one to see them alive. Whoever killed them was.
JENNIFER: At least I finally saw the reason you couldn't get over Mark.
FRIDA: You should have seen it erect.
JENNIFER: You expecting someone?
FRIDA: No.
JENNIFER: Ignore it.
FRIDA: Fuck it's the cops. Peter saw me, now I have to let him in.
JENNIFER: Tell them you'll meet them outside.
FRIDA: Uh.... hi!
PETER: Frida, can we come in? We need to talk to you. It's important.
FRIDA: Uh... the buzzer's broken. I'll be down in a second.
FRIDA: What the fuck are we going to do?
JENNIFER: Hide him.
