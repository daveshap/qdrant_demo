JENNIFER: Yeah?
BETTY: Can I ask you a question?
JENNIFER: Sure.
BETTY: What goes on up at Lover's Lane?
JENNIFER: What do you mean?
BETTY: Well, you hear all these things lately. You know--kids spending so much time up there ... Is it holding hands? That kind of thing?
JENNIFER: Yeah ... That--and ...

JENNIFER: It doesn't matter.
BETTY: No. I want to know.
JENNIFER: ... Sex.
BETTY: Ah.
