FREDDY: What's that tune that you're playing
OLD VIOLINIST: Zis is an old Transylvanian Lullaby.
FREDDY: How sweet! Such a quaint little tune.
FREDDY: May I see your violin?
OLD VIOLINIST: It's an honor for me, sir. You play the violin?
FREDDY: Oh, just a little.
FREDDY: Nice! Nice little balance to it.
OLD VIOLINIST: Ja, ja.
