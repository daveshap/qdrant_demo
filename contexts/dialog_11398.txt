MRS. ROBINSON: Hello.
BEN'S VOICE: Mrs. Robinson?
MRS. ROBINSON: Yes?
BEN'S VOICE: It's Benjamin.
MRS. ROBINSON: Yes?
BEN'S VOICE: Benjamin Braddock.
MRS. ROBINSON: Benjamin -- where are you?
BEN'S VOICE: Can you look through the glass.
BEN'S VOICE: Can you see me now?
MRS. ROBINSON: Yes, I can.
BEN: I got a single room.
MRS. ROBINSON: That's fine.
BEN: But there's one thing. The desk clerk seemed to be a little bit suspicious. I mean -- I don't know what their policy is -- but --
MRS. ROBINSON: Well -- do you want to go up first?
BEN: Yes -- I think that would be good.
MRS. ROBINSON: I'll be up in five minutes.
BEN: Well -- goodbye then --
MRS. ROBINSON: Benjamin.
BEN: Yes?
MRS. ROBINSON: Isn't there something you want to tell me?
BEN: To tell you?
MRS. ROBINSON: Yes.
BEN: Well -- I want you to know how much I appreciate this -- really --
MRS. ROBINSON: The number.
BEN: What?
MRS. ROBINSON: The room number, Benjamin. I think you ought to tell me that.
BEN: Oh? You're absolutely right. Absolutely. It's 512.
MRS. ROBINSON: Thank you.
BEN: You're welcome. Well -- I'll see you later, Mrs. Robinson.
