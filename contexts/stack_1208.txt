How to structure table in MySQL for group chat application? I'm making a messaging application, and I need a way to organize and store messages. I was thinking something like a table that had all the group chat IDs and who was in which group chat, but MySQL doesn't have a list functionality. For the actual messages, I was thinking one large table with the group chat IDs and the message ID. To be honest, I really don't have a good way to approach this. I was even considering making a table for every group chat. How should I structure a database for a group messaging application?
