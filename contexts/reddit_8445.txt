Are work requirements for welfare effective, and how should we measure welfare success?
[Last year the Trump administration moved to restore work requirements for welfare recipients](https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/aug/30/trump-moves-restore-work-requirement-welfare/), bringing law back in line with the 1996 welfare reforms. 

This begs the question, are welfare work requirements effective? 

Two states seem to have done studies. [Maine produced this report](http://www.maine.gov/economist/docs/TANF%20Report%20Final%205-25-17.pdf) after instituting work requirements for food stamp recipients who were fit for work and found significant growth in incomes and decreases in joblessness. [The state of Kansas produced this report](https://thefga.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/PowerOfWork-KansasWelfareReform.pdf) which produced similar findings after instituting work requirements. 

However, [The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities produced this report](https://www.cbpp.org/research/poverty-and-inequality/work-requirements-dont-cut-poverty-evidence-shows) which found that, while joblessness decreases initially, the effects may not persist. 

I think another fair question to be asked in this discussion is, how should we measure the effectiveness of our welfare programs? Is it the number of people which we are able to enroll, or is it better measured by the enrolee's likelihood of finding a job which more than accounts for the welfare they were receiving?
