I found some articles from events that happened when I was in school.
Article One: My primary school teacher was killed shortly after I left to go to high school.

The article was published five years ago but seeing it just felt weird. I remember going back to the school in year 7 to pick my brother up and she wasn't in her usual place outside the doors of the year 5-6 classrooms. My aunt was good friends with one of the teachers, who could tell something was wrong and tried to help.

Article Two: One of the year 11 students jumped from the top floor balcony when I was in year 9.

One of my best friends was in the building at that time - about five minutes before I arrived - and she saw it happen. The school went into lockdown and classes continued like normal after two hours but everyone was hysterical and refused to do anything. Most of us ended up sitting in classrooms listening to people screaming and crying about what happened. His sister had to be taken out of her lesson and sit in the office for a while. No one got sent home but no one really had lessons that day, either. The year 11 student did live past the event but I don't know what happened to him after we both left high school.

I don't know, I just saw the articles again today and it felt weird reading them again since I knew both of those people and I'd talked to them or seen them around.
