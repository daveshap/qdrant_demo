Unpopular opinion: It's possible to catch feelings for absolutely anyone. Either you control your feelings or your feelings will control you.
I believe that you can fall in love with anyone who is somewhat attractive. I think the more time you spend connecting with a good looking person, more feelings are created. I believe we have the power to control who we're into. I don't think soul mates exist.

EDIT: This post blew up more than I anticipated... Thanks for all your answers.

EDIT 2: When I say attractive I'm not just talking about physical attraction, I'm talking about all the characteristics that make the person attractive. I know you need more than physical attraction to fall in love. That's super superficial lol. All you need is attraction
