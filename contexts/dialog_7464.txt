JABEZ: What's the matter with you?
STEVENS: You are afraid!
JABEZ: Afraid ... of what?
STEVENS: -- of what happens after we die!
JABEZ: Are you plumb crazy, man! What do you think happens? We're buried -- that's all.
STEVENS: But what becomes of our souls?
JABEZ: Why do you fret about something that isn't there?
STEVENS: Don't say that -- I know it is --
JABEZ: All right -- so it's buried with you!
STEVENS: What if one hasn't a soul any more? What of that?
JABEZ: Huh? -- What's that? Well -- what about it? Who cares, anyhow?
STEVENS: I do -- and I think you should too.
JABEZ: Stevens -- what's all this leading up to? You know something. Come on! Out with it -- you know something about me!
JABEZ: Who are these people?
BELLE: They are all friends of mine -- from over the mountain. Welcome! Help yourselves to drinks! Glad you could come! Have a good time.
