RENAULT: Well I was right. You are a sentimentalist.
RICK: Stay where you are. I don't know what you're talking about.
RENAULT: What you just did for Laszlo, and that fairy tale that you invented to send Ilsa away with him. I know a little about women, my friend. She went, but she knew you were lying.
RICK: Anyway, thanks for helping me out.
RENAULT: I suppose you know this isn't going to be pleasant for either of us, especially for you. I'll have to arrest you of course.
RICK: As soon as the plane goes, Louis.
STRASSER: What is the meaning of that phone call?
RENAULT: Victor Laszlo is on that plane.
STRASSER: Why do you stand here? Why don't you stop him?
RENAULT: Ask Monsieur Rick.
