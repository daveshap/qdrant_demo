This is to all the people who are jobless, skipping classes, or completely hopeless in life because of anxiety disorders
My life is far, very far from perfect. But I want to share something.

I graduated high school in 2014. I was a terrible student. I skipped classes like nobody else did. Not because I am “lazy”, but because my anxiety was so high that it totally hindered my ability to stay in class. 

After I graduated, I spent 2015 and 2016 housebound. Agoraphobic,  depressed and fucked up, with no perspective in life. I never imagined I could even enter the room where an university entrance exam would be applied. And I mean it. I couldn’t imagine myself there. I couldn’t even go to the supermarket that is literally in front of my house. 

A miracle happened by the end of 2016. I decided to take an exam, just to TRAIN. To see if I could stay locked in a room with other people for hours. I never expected to pass the exam. I never expected be able to get into the *best university of the continent I’m from*. I still don’t believe in it... kind of. 2017 was like a dream or something to me. I still can’t believe I made it.

I still have problems. Many problems. I am still anxious, and my anxiety is still an obstacle in my daily routine. However...

I am not hopeless anymore. I can look to the horizon and see a brighter future. I can see myself graduating, I can see myself in a job, and I can see myself slowly getting more socially confident. I feel I can make it.

Please, never, never give up on yourself. Even if you are housebound or jobless, skipping all of your classes, even if nobody else around you believe in you, keep going. You are much stronger than you think you are, I guarantee it. I experienced it. Just put yourself in a situation where you have the possibility of improving and making some kind of progress.

EDIT: I’m so glad this message somehow helped and inspired some people. I wish the best for all of you. You can and *will* dominate anxiety.
