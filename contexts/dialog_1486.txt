BATEMAN: Are you telling me you've never gotten it on with a girl?
ELIZABETH: No! I'm not a lesbian. Why do you think I'd be into that?
BATEMAN: Well, you went to Sarah Lawrence for one thing.
ELIZABETH: Those are Sarah Lawrence guys, Patrick. You're making me feel weird.
BATEMAN: Did you know that Whitney Houston's debut LP called simply Whitney Houston had four number-one singles on it? Did you know that, Christie? Whitney's voice leaps across so many boundaries and is so versatile-though she's mainly a jazz singer-that it's hard to take in the album on a first listening.
ELIZABETH: You actually listen to Whitney Houston? You actually have a Whitney Houston CD? More than one?
