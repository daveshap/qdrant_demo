Is it possible to request a mapped diagram of electricity usage from your provider? Whenever I see our electric bill, it just shows the amount owed, and the amount used (in kWh).However, it would be really nice if we could request or pay a premium per month, for a service that shows a diagram of which outlets are being used the most. This would be very beneficial in determining which appliance in the house we could be more conservative with.Is it abnormal to call  the energy provider and request something like this? Or is it even a thing?Thanks for reading :)
