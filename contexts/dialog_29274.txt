LORI: Well...What do you say?
QUAID: I'm late.
LORI: Sweetheart...I know it's hard being in a new town, but let's at least give it a chance here. Okay?
QUAID: Lori, don't you understand? I feel I was meant for something more than this. I want to do something with my life.--I want to be somebody.
LORI: You are somebody. You're the man I love.
QUAID: Bye.
