JESSIE: My heart can't take much more of this. Look, if we climb down from here, it'll take two hours to get back to the station.
GABE: That's exactly what I want you to do.
JESSIE: What about you?
GABE: What do you think? Maybe I could reach the ledge without falling. No, forget it.
JESSIE: Oh, good. For a minute I thought you'd lost your mind.
GABE: But maybe with a good start I can hit those hand-holds.
JESSIE: Hand-holds?! I can barely see them.
GABE: We don't have time to argue about it!
JESSIE: Are you crazy? Has the altitude shrunk your brain, Gabe?
GABE: Take the rope.
JESSIE: I won't do it. No way.
GABE: Take the rope.
JESSIE: Enough's enough. How could anybody in their right mind... then again, you never were in your right mind.
GABE: Wrap it around that rock twice.
JESSIE: I'm going to wrap it around your throat!
GABE: An' if I miss, dig in and try your best to slow the fall.
JESSIE: Forget it! I refuse!
GABE: Fine, it shouldn't bother your conscience.
JESSIE: Don't lay any guilt on me. Suicide's a personal thing, best done alone.
