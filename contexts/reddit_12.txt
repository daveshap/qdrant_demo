I’m 13 and I still play with toys, and everyone (including my family) makes fun of me for it. What do I do?
Hello!! I am a big fan of Littlest Pet Shop, but everyone makes fun of me for it!! No matter what I’m into, they make fun of me for it. I like FNaF, they say that game is for kids. I like Invader Zim, they say I’m too old for cartoons. I say I want to cosplay, they say I’m too old for dress up. I like video games, they say I’m a girl and I need to act like it. I just feel like I’m not good enough for them and very immature. What do I do?
