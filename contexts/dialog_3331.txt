ALLENBY: ... Were you going somewhere?
CHANCE: No, Robert.
ALLENBY: ... Oh. ... My God, I only wish that Benjamin had your recuperative powers... Anyway, the President offered to sit in for Ben at the meeting, quite a nice gesture, I felt. He's due here soon, I believe.
CHANCE: Yes, Robert. I know about the President.
ALLENBY: ... Oh? You've heard?
CHANCE: Yes. Ben called me. He wants me to meet the President.
ALLENBY: He does, does he?
CHANCE: Yes, Ben told me to be in his room at ten o'clock.
ALLENBY: Why, that's terrific, Chauncey.
CHANCE: How do I know when it's ten o'clock?
ALLENBY: ... It's five of, you'd best get on in there.
CHANCE: Thank you, Robert.
CHANCE: I would like to walk today.
ALLENBY: Hell yes - walk. You're meeting the President, aren't you?
CHANCE: Oh, really?
SMYTHE: May I help you, Mr. Gardiner?
CHANCE: Yes. I would like to go to Rand Memorial Hospital.
SMYTHE: ... Sir?
CHANCE: Yes.
SMYTHE: ... Did you wish to see someone, sir?
CHANCE: Yes, I would like to see Ben.
SMYTHE: Oh, Mr. Rand, of course. Right this way, sir.
RAND: Chauncey, up and around this morning, are you?
CHANCE: Yes, Ben. My leg is not very sore.
RAND: Well, that's good news, my boy.
CHANCE: You're looking much better today, Ben.
RAND: Hah! It's all make-up, Chauncey... I asked nurse Teresa to fix me up, I didn't want the President to think I was going to die during our talk.
CHANCE: I understand.
RAND: No one likes a dying man, my boy - because few know what death is. All we know is the terror of it. But you're an exception, Chauncey - that's what I admire in you, your marvelous balance. You don't stagger back and forth between fear and hope - you're a truly peaceful man.
CHANCE: Thank you, Ben. ... The nurse did a very good job, Ben.
