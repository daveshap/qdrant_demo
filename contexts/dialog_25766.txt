CHEKOV: Actually, Captain, your precise target area was thirty-five meters that way.
KIRK: Thanks for pointing that out.
KIRK: Oh
SCOTTY: I've warned ye about that back of yours. You should have a doctor take a look at it.
KIRK: Tomorrow I want to make a tri-elliptical jump. That's where you jump out over Northern China and make three complete orbits before you start re-entry.
CHEKOV: Captain. Perhaps you have forgotten that tomorrow is the christening ceremony.
KIRK: I'm not going Scotty, help me with this chute.
SCOTTY: What do you mean, you're not going? We promised.
KIRK: When I retired, I swore I'd never set foot on a starship again, and I meant it.
CHEKOV: Captain=8A
KIRK: I don't want to hear anymore about it. I'm not going, and that's final.
