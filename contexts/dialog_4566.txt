VIOLET: What's wrong?
CORKY: Nothing.
VIOLET: Yes there is. I felt it this morning when I brought you the coffee.
CORKY: Shit, here we go.
VIOLET: You didn't want to see me, did you?
CORKY: If there is one thing I can't stand about sleeping with women, it's all the fucking mind reading.
VIOLET: What are you afraid of?
CORKY: I'm not afraid of anything.
VIOLET: I don't understand - ?
CORKY: I know! You can't understand, because we're different, Violet. We're different.
VIOLET: We're not that different, Corky.
CORKY: How can you sit in that bed and say that?
VIOLET: Because it's the truth.
CORKY: Let me guess. This is where you tell me that what matters is on the inside. That inside you, there is a little dyke just like me?
VIOLET: Oh no, she's nothing like you. She's a lot smarter than you.
CORKY: Is that what her daddy tells her?
VIOLET: I know what I am. I don't need to have it tattooed on my shoulder.
CORKY: What are you saying? That you don't have sex with men?
VIOLET: I don't.
CORKY: For Christ's sake, Violet! I heard you! Thin walls, remember?
VIOLET: What you heard wasn't sex.
CORKY: What the fuck was it?
VIOLET: All my life, everyone has been telling me that when I have sex, I'm not really having sex. Not real sex. But they're wrong. I know what is and isn't sex and what you heard was definitely not sex.
CORKY: What was it then?
VIOLET: Work.
