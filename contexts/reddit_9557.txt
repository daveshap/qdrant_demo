The "age" of your money
I mention the app You Need a Budget quite often, so I thought I'd share a win as-of-today. But this also involves describing what it means by the "age" of your money. The concept doesn't really work for all situations, but basically what it means is:

"How long ago you earned the money you're spending today."

YNAB uses an average of your last 10 transactions. As in, you get a deposit from work on July 1. And for the sake of ease, let's say your bank account and savings were at $0 on that day. If you spend $50 on groceries today, your money you spent is 9 days old. YNAB recommends stretching things until your money is at least 30 days old, as in you're using last month's paychecks to pay this month's bills. It also means you're not living paycheck to paycheck.

Well my win today is that my money is **60 days old as of today**. So, I'm using my paychecks from May to pay my bills for July. I don't make much money, but scrimping $5 here and there has added up to a bigger buffer than I've ever had before.
