CRAWFORD: ...twenty-eight minutes. Cryptography at Langley?
SARAH: They got shot a Telex. They're on if now...
BOWMAN: No. The numbers aren't right for a jailhouse alphabet code. It's a book code. And your message has to go out in it, or he'll know it's not Lecktor talking to him.
CRAWFORD: Book code?
BOWMAN: 'One hundred prayers' could be the page number. The paired numbers and the scriptural references could be line and letter. But what book?
CRAWFORD: Not the Bible?
BOWMAN: No. Galatians 15:2? Galatians has only six chapters. The same with Jonah 6:8 -- Jonah has four chapters. Lecktor wasn't using a Bible.
GRAHAM: Then the Tooth Fairy named the book in the part Lecktor tore out.
BOWMAN: Right. What about sweating Lecktor?
GRAHAM: They tried sodium amytal on him three years ago to find where he buried a Princeton student. He gave them a recipe for potato chip dip.
BOWMAN: It has to be a book the Tooth Fairy would know Lecktor has in his cell.
GRAHAM: He'd know it from articles he's read about Lecktor...
CRAWFORD: Willingham, when he tossed his cell, took Polaroids so they could get everything back in place...
BOWMAN: Have him meet me with pictures of Lecktor's books...
CRAWFORD: Where?
BOWMAN: Library of Congress.
GRAHAM: Twenty-five minutes. We won't make it in time.
CRAWFORD: We let Lecktor's message run as is and decode it after. Or we pull it, work our the code and put ours in next week.
GRAHAM: Can we still get Lecktor's message out of the paper?
CRAWFORD: Yes. And I'm leery of running Lecktor's message without knowing what it says.
GRAHAM: And if we pull it, we lose a week... We only have two to the next full moon.
CRAWFORD: It's your call, Will. What do we do?
GRAHAM: Run it.
CRAWFORD: What if it encourages the Tooth Fairy to do something besides write?
GRAHAM: We will feel sick for a very long time.
GRAHAM: Who is it?
CRAWFORD: Will, Bowman just broke the code. It was a James Beard cook book. You need to know what it says right now.
GRAHAM: What'd it say?
CRAWFORD: I'll tell you in a second. Now listen to me: everything is okay, I'm taking care of it, so stay on the phone when I tell you.
GRAHAM: Tell me now.
CRAWFORD: It says: 'Graham home, 3860 DeSoto Highway, Marathon, Florida. Save yourself. Kill them all. It's your home address, Will. The bastard gave him your home address.
GRAHAM: Get me a plane...
CRAWFORD: Wait, Will...
GRAHAM: Get me a plane!
CRAWFORD: I'll pick you up in...
GRAHAM: I won't be here.
