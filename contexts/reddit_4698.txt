I feel like I'm spiralling again.
Things should be good now but I can't seem to stop thinking about how I always manage to ruin my relationships and people let go of me once they realize I'm a mess who requires far more support than anyone could reasonably give. I spend as much time at work as I can just to be around my coworkers, who are pretty much my only friends at this point. I don't even know what I want anymore, I'm just upset. I try not to expect too much from people but then I feel hollow and disconnected. 

I've tried therapy. It was alright until I got scared and felt I was wasting everyone's time with my complaining. I'm sorry. Things are going well in my life, really. But I'm still such a mess inside and that's so scary. 

I really want to be loved but I don't know how. I really want to love myself, but I don't know how.
