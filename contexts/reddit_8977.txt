Fact check Obama vs. NRA on gun control? (specific quotes included)
I came across the following statement from the NRA in [this article](http://www.npr.org/2016/06/15/482156355/donald-trump-teases-that-he-could-buck-the-nra-on-one-aspect-of-guns):

>"The NRA believes that terrorists should not be allowed to purchase or possess firearms, period. **Anyone on a terror watchlist who tries to buy a gun should be thoroughly investigated by the FBI and the sale delayed while the investigation is ongoing**. If an investigation uncovers evidence of terrorist activity or involvement, the government should be allowed to immediately go to court, block the sale, and arrest the terrorist. At the same time, due process protections should be put in place that allow law-abiding Americans who are wrongly put on a watchlist to be removed. That has been the position of Sen. John Cornyn (R.-Tex.) and a majority of the U.S. Senate. Sadly, President Obama and his allies would prefer to play politics with this issue."

There was also [a video](http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/obama-to-gun-owners-im-not-looking-to-disarm-you/) making rounds a few days back (before the Orlando shooting) in which Obama said:

>I just came from a meeting today in the Situation Room in which I got people who we know have been on ISIL Web sites, living here in the United States, U.S. citizens, and we’re allowed to put them on the no-fly list when it comes to airlines, but **because of the National Rifle Association, I cannot prohibit those people from buying a gun**. This is somebody who is a known ISIL sympathizer. And if he wants to walk in to a gun store or a gun show right now and buy as much — as many weapons and ammo as he can, nothing’s prohibiting him from doing that, even though the FBI knows who that person is.

Emphasis added in each quote. The statements appear contradictory. My best guess is that both sides are interested in passing legislation to prevent these situations, but both sides also want to package such bills with other more controversial legislation. Can someone give me the full story here?
