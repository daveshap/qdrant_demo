What would need to be cut to achieve the rumored $10.5 trillion in cuts proposed by the Trump administration?
[The Hill is reporting today](http://thehill.com/policy/finance/314991-trump-team-prepares-dramatic-cuts) that the Trump administration's first proposed budget will include $10.5 trillion in cuts over a 10 year period.

The article lists a few programs which are on the chopping block:

* $900 million from economic development programs

* $286 million from [community policing programs.](https://www.justice.gov/jmd/file/821491/download)

* A maximum of $489 million from [violence against women act programs.](https://www.justice.gov/jmd/file/822296/download)

* [$385 million from legal aid programs](http://www.lsc.gov/media-center/publications/fy-2017-budget-request)

* [$147 million from the National Endowment for the Arts](https://www.arts.gov/sites/default/files/nea-fy16-appropriations-request.pdf)

* [$445 million from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.](http://www.cpb.org/files/appropriation/justification-FY17-and-FY19.pdf)

* [$3.28 billion](https://energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2015/01/f19/DOE%20FY%202016%20Budget%20Fact%20Sheet.pdf) from renewables programs at the Department of Energy.

* $33 million by reducing nuclear energy research to 2008 levels. [$875 million in 2008](https://energy.gov/articles/department-energy-requests-243-billion-fy-2008-budget) vs [$908 million in the most recent budget I could find](https://energy.gov/sites/prod/files/2015/01/f19/DOE%20FY%202016%20Budget%20Fact%20Sheet.pdf)





There are a couple of other cuts whose amounts I can't calculate, but they don't seem to be to large programs.

Adding up the above, it gets to about $5.5 billion in cuts.

To achieve $10500 billion in cuts over 10 years would arithmetically require about $1050 billion in cuts in the first year.  Maybe a bit less if we account for inflation.

The specified cuts are ~0.5% of the total necessary to achieve the stated target.  What would plausibly be the other 99.5% of the cuts?  Have specific proposals been made in the past which identify particular programs?  The article mentions a 2015 Republican Study Committee budget, but I can't find if that proposed specific cuts to specific programs, or if it was just a general level target.
