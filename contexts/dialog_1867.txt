BUD: Are you all right?
FRAN: Sure. What's that funny smell?
BUD: Gas. Didn't you turn it on?
FRAN: Yes. I was boiling some water to get the coffee stains out of my dress.
BUD: You turned it on -- but you didn't light it.
FRAN: Are you supposed to?
BUD: In this house, you're supposed to.
FRAN: Oh.
BUD: What are you doing with that?
FRAN: I was washing my stockings, so I decided I might as well do your socks.
BUD: Thank you.
FRAN: It's very curious -- I could only find three and a half pair.
BUD: Well, things are a little disorganized around here.
