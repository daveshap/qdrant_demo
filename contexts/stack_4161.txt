UK EEA Family Permit for Iranian wife and her parents I am German and live in the United States with my Iranian wife. We would like to spend our holidays in the UK this June, and also want to invite her parents from Iran to come along with us.My wife should be good with the Family permit as a spouse of an EEA person, but are also her parents (as parents-in-law of an EEA person)? If yes, would we have to enter the UK together?Thanks for any advice.Dominik
