SAUNDERS: Did you like the first act?
DIZ: Yeah. What about the second act?
SAUNDERS: That's taking place outside now.
MCGANN: Did I hear right? Did he say *Willet Creek*?
PAINE: Let's get away from here.
MCGANN: That's dynamite, Joe!
PAINE: --amazing coincidence! Of all places in the world--to choose Willet Creek for his boys' camp!
MCGANN: Joe--I'm getting leery of this guy. We keep calling him dumb--and he keeps winding up in our hair! I'm telling you--when he finds out there's a dam going up where he wants his camp, he's gonna start asking questions six ways from Sunday--
PAINE: Be quiet, Chick--I'm trying to think-- This Deficiency Bill is going to be read in the Senate tomorrow.
MCGANN: Tomorrow! Joe--he'll hear the section on Willet Dam. He can't be there!
PAINE: I know that.
MCGANN: Listen--tomorrow I take him to see monuments--if I have to hit him over the head with a couple!
PAINE: That won't work, Chick. This boy's honest, not stupid.
MCGANN: Susan!
PAINE: My daughter isn't here to carry out assignments like that for *anybody*.
MCGANN: Well, then--this is too much for *my* lame brain. I'm calling Jim Taylor.
PAINE: Jim's methods won't do in Washington.
MCGANN: Joe--listen--all Susan has to do is turn those big eyes on him--he'll fall all over himself--just keep him out of there *one afternoon*--while they read that bill--
