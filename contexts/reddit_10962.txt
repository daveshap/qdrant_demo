I wish i could go to sleep to never wake up again.
I'm only 20 years old and I'm already pretty tired. It's like everyday i go through the same shit and a painful feeling of loneliness and depression hits me too. I have heavy social anxiety and I'm shy af, also no friends, no gf, and my future seems even darker. I cry myself to sleep every night and i reached the point where i wish i could go to sleep and die, because i know i don't have the balls to actually kill myself.
