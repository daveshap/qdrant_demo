MARY: Oh, there you are--
DAN: That's right--you're the one I was looking for. You'll excuse me. How about you and I being alone?
MARY: Not now, Toots--Which is the right way to say this? You're dumber than me--or--you're dumber than I?
DAN: Let me see now--Don't tell me-- You're dumber than me and I'm dumber than you. I don't get it.
MARY: Never mind.
DENBY: H'mm ... no wonder I have trouble rounding up this show--Don't you know there's a rehearsal going on?-- And you wanted a raise.--Come on--get going or you'll get it!
MARY: Oh, all right-- See you later, Toots.
