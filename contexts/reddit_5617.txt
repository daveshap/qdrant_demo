99% Sure my first employer is giving me a bad refrence.
 I've only have one "real" job with a company. I worked as a nanny before that and did some volunteering and work with my dad for his business. My first (previous) job lasted 5 months. I worked in a daycare and was cocerced into resignation for reporting child abuse (it's super common in this field). I've offically decided not to pursue a career in early childhood education and I want to take my previous company off because I think the director is giving me a bad refrence. 

How can I get a job if I take my only real job off? I'm 21. How can I make me resume good?
