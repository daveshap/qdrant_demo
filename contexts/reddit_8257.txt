What evidence is there for or against the claim that Tulsi Gabbard is being unduly influenced by the Russians?
Note: My first post here, sorry if any mistakes, am happy to edit anything to comply with rules.

Context: Hillary Clinton [insinuated](https://edition.cnn.com/2019/10/18/politics/hillary-clinton-tulsi-gabbard/index.html) that Tulsi Gabbard is a Russian asset. There have been insinuations she is supported by [Russian bots](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/oct/18/hillary-clinton-hints-russia-is-grooming-tulsi-gabbard-as-third-party-candidate), and is an [apologist](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/global-opinions/tulsi-gabbards-syria-record-shows-why-she-cant-be-president/2019/08/01/f804c790-b497-11e9-8949-5f36ff92706e_story.html) for Syria's Basher al-Assad.

What evidence has there been so far that may support or debunk such a claim?

Thank you!
