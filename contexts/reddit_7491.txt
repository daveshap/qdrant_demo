Should I do a second master's or a doctoral program?
Currently a full-time grad student in education (curriculum & instruction), before I came back to school I taught third grade for several years. I'm interested in leadership, management and organizational behavior as they relate to public schools. I'm not interested in becoming a principal or superintendent, but I am very interested in helping improve leadership practices in schools/districts, improving workplace culture, etc. Ideally, after I finish school I'd work as a consultant, help shape policy, or work at a think tank. I also wouldn't mind working to develop professional development and training for companies

When I first started my master's in the fall, I had the idea that I'd do a PhD afterwards, but after a lot of reflection and talking to some professors/friends, I realized this wasn't a good idea. I'm passionate about what I'm studying, and I enjoy researching, but I'm not interested enough to sustain a 4-5 year PhD program and all the stress that comes with it. Plus, I have no interest in academia whatsoever, which renders the whole idea moot

I feel like I've got a few options, I'm just not sure which would be the best:

**Option 1**: I just go back to teaching after I finish my master's, teach for a couple of years, then see how I'm feeling and if I want to go back for another degree. This is the one I'm least excited about

**Option 2**: I could go into an EdD (Doctor of Education) program. From what I understand, these are geared towards people who want to continue working in non-academic roles, whether it's in a school/district, for a non-profit, in government, etc. This would still involve research and a dissertation, but is more about practical solutions. It would also take only three years to finish. The downside is that, for the most part, these degrees seem more intended for people who want to be principals/superintendents. While I'm sure I could find a different career, I also don't want to get into a program and then find out my non-administrator career options would be limited. On top of that, not all of these programs offer funding. Still, I found a few schools that are promising and worth looking into more

**Option 3**: I go into another master's program. One of the professors I talked to about this encouraged me to think in terms of "return on investment". In his words: "If you can find a master's degree that gets you what you need and lets you finish in two years as opposed to several, why not do that? It gets you back in the workforce faster". I was hesitant at first about getting another master's, mainly because I thought it'd look weird on my resume to have two rather than an MA and PhD/EdD, but the more I think about it, the more it makes sense (and I could be wrong, but I don't think too many employers would mind what the degrees are if the skills and knowledge are there)

I'm also finding a few interesting options if I go this route. For example, [UPenn offers dual degree programs](https://www.gse.upenn.edu/academics/dual-joint-degrees), and I'd be interested in pursuing the dual program through Wharton and the Grad School of Education there (either Education Policy or Educational Entrepreneurship), though a couple of the others are also interesting 

**Option 4**: I go back to the workforce, but do online certifications through something like Coursera or EdX. No, these aren't full fledged degrees, but they'd still teach me valuable skills, and it'd probably be the most cost/time efficient way, especially if I could get whatever district I work for to reimburse my tuition. It makes sense in a number of ways, but I'm really not big on the idea of returning to teaching

This has been on my mind a lot recently, especially since I've been spending so much time at home. I'd like to make some kind of decision relatively soon, just so I can start studying for the GRE if I need to, and so I can have a bit of peace of mind regarding my future. Would appreciate any advice and opinions, so long as they are constructive
