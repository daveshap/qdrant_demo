Is it bad to use the recruiting company that helped me find my current job, to help me get a new job?
I got hired at a company 6 months ago via a recruiting company. The company I now work at is going down the tubes and I need to find a new job. 

I liked the recruiting company that helped me get this job and I was wondering if (1) it's a bad idea to ask them for help finding a new job, and (2) if there's any chance they might tell my current company I'm looking for a job?

Thoughts?
