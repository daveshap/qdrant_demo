moving for the summer with no job prospects
hello! i'm a (20f) senior college student majoring in marketing/graphic design, with a small freelance photography job on the side. i live in an incredibly small town. i had an internship lined up for me in dc, but due to covid, it unfortunately fell through.

my mental health has declined incredibly during the last few months being in my hometown. at the moment, i am genuinely considering/planning moving to dc for the next couple months until school starts with no real job/internship prospects. as it is this late in the year, most internship deadlines have closed, but i have nevertheless been searching endlessly and applying. 
would moving for two months to a city with no steady income be a bad move? i know for a fact that it would help with my mental health and motivate me. i have enough money saved to sustain myself, and believe that i would be able to find some opportunities with the photography, as i did last year. i'm just worried that covid has totally taken a lot of my chances away. what would you suggest? at the moment, i've been searching for jobs through indeed and linkedin, and have found some apartments.
