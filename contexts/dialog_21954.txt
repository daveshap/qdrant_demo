JIM: I think his first name's Ray--I have to see him. It's very important.
SERGEANT: What's the charge?
OFFICER: Assault with a deadly weapon.
JIM: Listen--
SERGEANT: He's not here. He's not at Juvenile Hall. I don't know where he is. He's out on a call and he'll be out all night. How old are you?
JIM: My parents know I'm out. They know I'm here.
SERGEANT: Come back tomorrow.
JIM: I'll wait for him.
SERGEANT: Why don't you come back tomorrow, son? Ever been booked before?
