CARTER: Johnny! Where the hell have you been?
BOOK: Never mind. I'm coming in to take care of business. How hot am I?
CARTER: Too hot. Don't do it. Don't come in.
BOOK: I'm coming.
CARTER: Listen, Johnny, don't do anything stupid. You couldn't get within a mile of Schaeffer right now. So stay put... Stay in touch â€“ I'll let you know when maybe it makes sense.
CARTER: You hear me?
BOOK: I hear you. I'll stay in touch.
CARTER: That's more like it. Where are you at, anyway?
BOOK: Where I'm at is maybe 1890.
CARTER: Say again?
BOOK: Make that 1790.
