KLUTE: I got a call from Ross this morning. Cable owned a plot of woodland -- he'd go there on weekends. They found Tom Grunemann's body buried there. They've notified his wife.
BREE: Oh. Well it wasn't us city people that did it -- your fine rosy-cheeked country boy.
KLUTE: Mm.
BREE: You're going back?
KLUTE: Mm.
