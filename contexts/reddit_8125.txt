What specific new information did we learn from the indictment and guilty plea released by Robert Mueller today?
Today Special Counsel Robert Mueller revealed [an indictment](https://www.justice.gov/file/1007271/download) against Paul Manafort and Richard Gates.  Manafort [was then-candidate Trump's campaign chairman in the summer of 2016.](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/30/us/politics/paul-manafort-indicted.html?_r=0)  Gates was [his close aide and protege.](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/16/us/politics/rick-gates-russia.html)

Also today, [a guilty plea](https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/4163402/Papadopoulos-Statement-Offense.pdf) by George Papadopoulos for lying to the FBI was revealed.  Mr. Papadopoulos was a foreign policy adviser to the Trump campaign.   [He was arrested in July 2017 and this case had been under seal from then until today.](https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/4163479/7-28-17-Motion-to-Seal-Papadopoulos.pdf)

What new facts did we learn from these documents today?  The Manafort/Gates indictment is an allegation yet to be proven by the government.  The factual statements in the Papadopoulos plea however are admitted as true by Mr. Papadopoulos.

Are there any totally new revelations in this?  Prior known actions where more detail has been added?

**Edit 4:23 PM EST:** Since posting this, an additional document of interest has become available.  That is a [court opinion and order](http://online.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/redacted_unsealed_opinion_20171030.pdf) requiring the attorney for Manafort and Gates to testify to certain matters around their statements to the government concerning foreign agent registration.
