After searching for about a year, I finally got a job! I'm really happy, but am intensely worried about office politics. A slight hint of it stresses me out so much. Any advice for the mindset to adopt or a way to present myself to move away from politics?
I generally exude a friendly and easygoing disposition, as that is the person I am trying to be. I was a very judgemental and aloof person in the past and want to change that, have been changing that. I don't ever wanna go back there, but I worry that office politics is gonna occur, and I worry I don't know how to handle feelings of injustice or indignance. I want to enjoy being hired by a company I admire (even though I have heard that it's quite political, but these are all hearsays), and enjoy finally not being unemployed and not having a chaotic routine. I just wanna have a great time there. All these fears crept up to me today as I interacted with an employer via email and felt that ache in my chest.
