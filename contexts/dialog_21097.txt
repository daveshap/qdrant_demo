STEW: What's the idea, Anne?
ANNE: The idea is simply this - that I want those people to leave here immediately.
STEW: Now wait a minute. Aren't you being a little unreasonable?
ANNE: Unreasonable! Have you any idea what the place looks like downstairs? Do you expect me to stand here and see this place turned into a cheap barroom?
STEW: Now wait, don't get excited, Anne. There's no reason for that. Perhaps the boys have had a little too much to drink. That's all right. I'm sorry. I'll go right down and throw them out. That's no reason for you to take this attitude. After all, I certainly have a right to invite a few of my friends to my house, haven't I?
ANNE: Your house?
STEW: O-o-oh, I get youâ€” All right. All right. I don't blame you. I kinda forgot myself for a moment, there. That's what I call getting me told, isn't it, Anne?
