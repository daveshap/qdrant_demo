Unemployment and Scam Interviews
Hi everyone! I’m a little freaked out as I applied to a role on linkedin not realizing that the company is a known scam. Accompanied by a different name texted me (which is already really sketchy since I think that’s incredibly unprofessional unless I agreed to it in an application) saying that I’ve been invited to interview, however it was not one I’ve ever heard of I have no record of an application to this company name.

When I asked them about my application they gave me details that made me suspect the app were taken from the company I thought I had applied for on LinkedIn as if they were the same people. I’m currently on Massachusetts unemployment and I’m worried that if I don’t interview with what is looking to be a scam/MLM that this will disqualify me.

Does anyone have an idea of how best to go forward?

Edit: The one I reported online is the one I thought I had applied on linkedin not the one that supposedly is texting me.
