How are two wifi adapters handled in ubuntu 17.10 by default? The PCI wifi card in my laptop is rather underwhelming, and unti I fix it, or get an another one, I decided to use a USB wifi adapter that I found lying around.And I noticed that I can actually use both at the same time out of the box to connect to the same network. The question is, what happens if I don't disable the PCI card, which one is used by what? And if one of them fails to connect for some reason, does it switch to the other one? Also is there load balancing by default? That would be awesome.I'm asking all these, because I can't always carry the USB adapter around, and it would be really convenient if I didn't have to disable the PCI adapter every time I plug the USB one in.
