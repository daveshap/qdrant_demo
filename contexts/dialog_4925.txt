TOM: Maybe I haven't been here long enough. But, hey, congratulations on the promotion.
JANE: How can you say that to me?
TOM: Sorry. I can't stand here feeing bad that I don't feel worse. This has happened at every station I ever worked for. Look, I think it's crazy for you to come in here tomorrow and start a new job. I have a week to get to my job. Let's get the hell away to some island fast and find out how we are together away from this.
JANE: Well, I just think that' an extraordinary proposal.
TOM: That's yes?
JANE: That's more than 'yes' -- that's 'you bet.'
