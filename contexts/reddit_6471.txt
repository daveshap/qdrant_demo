Why is my company “suggesting” us to take a day off on Easter Monday?
Hi all,

I work in a large publicly traded media agency and we’ve received an email from our global ceo who suggested us to take a vacation day on Easter Monday. So we already have Friday off as a stat holiday but they’re suggesting we take the Monday off as well (using our own vacation day). Today we had a team meeting and my director mentioned that the reason for that is for “book keeping” and that publicly traded companies typically do these things to put them in a better financial position and without actually having to pay people off? They’re saying that if we all take a bit of sacrifice this will all be better for us in the long run..

Does anyone understand this at all? I am super confused on the reasoning but there seems to be a an underlying business strategy they are doing to protect the company? Someone please explain! :/ 

Thanks :)
