Email Help
For those email masters out there.  How do you organize your outlook, google, or other work emails accounts?  I always end up with 50+ folders and its a nightmare.  I know there are email guides and books for organization, but little specifically for the field.  I would love to read about any strategies you use or method.  Also include your functional area please
