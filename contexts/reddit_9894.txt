I am working on a competition to get students to create their alma mater song. Anyone out there with experience?
The school I am at right now is fairly new, and they are still creating a lot of their traditions. One thing they need is an alma mater song. We want the students to be the one to create it. So we were thinking about having a competition at the beginning of this year that would wrap up at the end of the spring semester. I am just wondering how some of you have gotten students to engage in this.
