DR. RUMACK: Elaine, you're a member of this crew. Can you face some unpleasant facts?
ELAINE: No.
DR. RUMACK: All right. Unless I can get all these people to a hospital quickly, I can't even be sure of saving their lives. Now, is there anyone else on board who can land this plane?
ELAINE: Well...
ELAINE: No. No one that I know of.
DR. RUMACK: I think you ought to know what our chances are. The life of everyone on board depends on just one thing: finding someone back there who not only can fly this plane, but who didn't have fish for dinner.
CAREY: Hello, I'm Paul Carey from the airline. I'm here to pick up Captain Kramer.
MRS. KRAMER: Oh, yes. Come in, Paul. Rex will be right out.
MRS. KRAMER: Shep, sit...sit! So, I understand you've got a real emergency down there.
CAREY: Well, to tell the truth, they really didn't fill me in on many of the details. Just told me to pick up Captain Kramer.
MRS. KRAMER: Something about a plane with no pilot?
CAREY: Yeah, something like that, but as I say, they didn't have time to tell me very much.
MRS. KRAMER: Shep, no! I'll bet you have exciting things happen all the time down there.
