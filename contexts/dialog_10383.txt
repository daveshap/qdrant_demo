VINCENT: Okay, how tall did you <i>used</i> to be?
EUGENE: Six one.
VINCENT: He's too tall.
GERMAN: You can wear lifts.
VINCENT: Even with lifts I'm never that tall.
GERMAN: There's a way.
VINCENT: You okay, Jerome?
EUGENE: Yeah. You want to go dancing tonight?
VINCENT: What's wrong with it?
EUGENE: I think I'd better choose the menu. After all, you're learning how to be me, I'm not learning how to be <i>you</i>.
VINCENT: Suit yourself.
EUGENE: Listen, I don't want you to think I'm ungrateful --I know you and that little broker--what do you call him?
VINCENT: German.
EUGENE: You're both going to a lot of trouble-- Maybe you can con somebody into believing you're me to get your foot in the door--but once you're inside, you're on your own. I'm sure you're sincere... ...but I was being groomed for something like this myself. Even without the accident I don't think I would have made it. My point is--how the hell do <i>you</i> expect to pull this off?
VINCENT: I don't know exactly, Jerome.
EUGENE: At least you're honest. Call me by my middle name--Eugene--If you're going to be Jerome, you may as well start getting used to it.
