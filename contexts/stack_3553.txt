For a \"normal\" computer user, does it make a difference to have a good entropy source? Let's take, for example, Linux. From my understanding, there are different sources and different ways that can be used to gather entropy (RNG daemon, Intel rrandr, TPM, etc). Some produce entropy that is of \"better quality\" than others. But, does it actually matter for a \"normal\" user? (Let's say a user that only uses web browsers, office programs, and a password manager).In which cases does the computer use entropy from the pool?Does it uses it when browsing https websites?Does it uses it when encrypting a file with 7zip or with a password manager?
