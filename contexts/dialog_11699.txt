KERI: Bruce... what's going on? The kids are here to pick out their costumes for the festival.
DEPUTY CLARK: Better take 'em to Virgil's downtown. We got a dead body in there.
KERI: A dead body?
DEPUTY CLARK: It's Amy Kramer.
KERI: My god...
DEPUTY CLARK: Pretty messy. Parents have already been notified. Our office has been trying to get a hold of you...
KERI: Do you know who did this?
DEPUTY CLARK: Well, Eddie Catero didn't show up for work this morning... parents say he never came home last night. Car's still missing.
KERI: Think Eddie had something to do with it?
DEPUTY CLARK: Doesn't look good.
