JEFF: From his landlord -- once a month.
LISA: It's utterly beautiful. I wish I could be creative.
JEFF: You are. You have a talent for creating difficult situations.
LISA: I do?

LISA: Surprise -- is the most important element of attack. And beside, you're not up on your private eye literature. When they're in trouble, it's always their Girl Friday who gets them out of it.
JEFF: The same girl who keeps him out of the clutches of seductive show girls, and over-passionate daughters of the rich.
LISA: The same.
JEFF: But he never ends up marrying her. Strange.
LISA: Weird. Why don't I slip into something comfortable?
JEFF: You mean -- like the kitchen? And make us some coffee?
LISA: Exactly what I had in mind -- along with some brandy.
