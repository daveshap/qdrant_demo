Avoiding visa refusal and travelling to a different Schengen country I am currently studying in Germany. My friend wants to apply for a Schengen visit visa to visit me in Germany. But with an increasing number of refugees in Germany, visitors from Pakistan are also facing similar visa rejections (that the concerned person will never return).Now to avoid this issue we are considering applying through another European member state with lower visa rejection ratio (eg Iceland) as entry port and then travel to Germany (staying there 1 month or so). and then going back from the same port used for entry. What issue could we face?
