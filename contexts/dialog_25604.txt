SHERMIN: There's nothing... No reports of sightings or landings or anything... in the other parts of the country or overseas... Seems like a totally isolated incident.
MAJOR BELL: It was only an accident that we discovered them.
SHERMIN: I know, but...
SHERMIN: You married, Major?
MAJOR BELL: Twenty-eight years.
SHERMIN: To the same woman?
MAJOR BELL: Yes.
SHERMIN: I tried it once... Fourteen years ago... 'I was a lousy husband and a worse father. The only thing I'm good at is this... At least until yesterday.

MAJOR BELL: It was kind of like clicking, maybe a language wasn't it?
SHERMIN: Listen to this. A woman was kidnapped in Eau Claire this morning. When a citizen went to her rescue the kidnapper threatened him with a gun and shouted at him in a strange 'clicking gibberish'...

SHERMIN: The police think he was high on drugs...
