NANCY: This is nice.
NEIL: Never been here before?
NANCY: Must have opened while I was away at school.
NEIL: Most authentic Mexican food in Springwood, which isn't saying much. your parents still live around here?
NANCY: My mother's dead. Died in her sleep.
NEIL: Sorry.
NANCY: My father an I...well, the family just seemed to fall apart.
NEIL: Sounds like a rough time.
NANCY: It was. Neil, do you believe in other realities?
NEIL: I've been to Pittsburgh. Does that count?
NANCY: I'm serious.
NEIL: Okay...I believe in different levels of conciousness, that sort of thing...but if you're into UFO's or Atlantis, you've lost me.
NANCY: What if I told you your patients are in real physical danger from their dreams?
NEIL: That's a new one. Is that what they're teaching now at Stanford?
NANCY: That's what I know.
NEIL: The nightmares are nothing but a symptom of their real problems.
NANCY: All right. Then let's eliminate the symptom for the time being.
NEIL: With Hypnocyl?
NANCY: That's right.
NEIL: You want me to prescribe an experimental psychoactive drug to a bunch of suicidal teenagers?
NANCY: Just until we get things under control.
NEIL: Dream deprivation is nothing to fool around with. you have no business taking it yourself.
NANCY: I used to be like them, Neil. I know what they're going through.
NEIL: So do I.
NANCY: Do you? You told me they're survivors...and they are. But how much longer they survive is up to us.
NEIL: I'm sorry, Nancy. The answer is no.
