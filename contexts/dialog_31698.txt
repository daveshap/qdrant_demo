FRAU BLUCHER: I hope you find this comfortable. This was Baron Victor's room.
FREDDY: It seems fine.
FRAU BLUCHER: You'll fine the keys to all the rooms in my cas... all the rooms in your castle on this ring. I'll leave it on the table here.
FREDDY: Does that include the key to the laboratory?
FRAU BLUCHER: You mean... the laboratory??
FREDDY: Yes!... the laboratory.
FRAU BLUCHER: No! Dr. Frankenstein always kept that separate.
FREDDY: May I have it, please?
