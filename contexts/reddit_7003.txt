Just got fired but I can’t leave the office?
I just got fired but my manager says he has to wait for HR to tell him what my last day is... but he says if I just leave now it’ll be considered quitting voluntarily. I’d rather be officially fired since I’m more likely to get unemployment then (this is in NY). 

Should I just leave now? I have an email and a recording proving that i was indeed fired. I was always under the impression that if someone got fired they had to leave immediately...
