Planned to kill myself today
January and February was the darkest time in my life and I decided that 18 April would be the most suitable day to end my life. Just like the stupid human I am, I made reminders on my calendar to remind me that it's time. The second reminder was to make an appointment with a psychiatrist for my family. Everything was sorted. 
But when the day came, I don't even remember what I had planned until I saw the reminder. 
Life gets better, it will go downhill too but only to rise again. This gave me hope to continue. Maybe I'll be stronger the next time a wave of sadness hits me.
