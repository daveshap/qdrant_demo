VALIANT: Yeah. I think Maroon plays the part of the sound mind, your wife the sound body.
ROGER RABBIT: I resent that innuendo! My wife is completely innocent.
VALIANT: Your wife may be a lot of things, pal, but innocent isn't one of them.
DOLORES: So what's the scam, Eddie?
VALIANT: Maybe Baby Herman was right. Somebody wants Acme's property. Cack the old man, pin it on Roger, and destroy the will.
ROGER RABBIT: The habeus corpus is thickening.
VALIANT: Yeah. Except they screwed up. I don't think they got the will.
ROGER RABBIT: How do you know that?
VALIANT: Well, Acme had the will in his pocket that night at the club. It was gone in the morning when the cops found the body.
DOLORES: Maybe they just took it out of his pocket.
VALIANT: Then why'd they bother to crack the safe? You can drop a Mosler 90 from Mount Baldy and it won't open.
ROGER RABBIT: Well, Mr. Smarty-Pants Detective, your logic is specious. What prevented Mr. Acme from putting the will back in the safe before they killed him?
VALIANT: Because he's not forty feet tall. The safe was up on the ceiling, remember?
DOLORES: Eddie, you still got it. Hey, tomorrow maybe I'll go down to probate court and see who's sniffin' around Acme's estate?
VALIANT: Yeah, do that. I'm gonna go rattle Maroon's cage.
