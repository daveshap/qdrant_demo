Could the Library of Alexandria have survived until today? The Royal Library of Alexandria was one of the greatest library of the ancient world. However it was destroyed during the 3rd century after years of decline.  Was such a library doomed to destruction sooner or later or could it have survived, with a bit of luck, until today ?To be clear, I am more interested in the content of the library (i.e., the papyrus scrolls) than the building in itself.
