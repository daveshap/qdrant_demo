My parents asked me to kill myself
I have always heard how if one is suffering they should reach out. So i reached out to my parents after a meltdown. Its been years since i am in depression nd suicidal nd have anxiety issues. I don't share the best relationship with my parents but some part of me still had hopes from them. Anyway yesterday i cried all day trying to explain to them my situation but they said i am lying nd i have no reason to be depressed about. My own parents told me if i am depressed then i probably want to kill myself too so y don't i do it if i really am depressed. Great solution actually. Now i might as well go ahead nd do it finally. Maybe i won't be a liar anymore...maybe i can finally find peace
