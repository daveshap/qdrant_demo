Position posted I'm interested in and qualified for....I already applied. Recuiter contacted me about it. Should I use them?
A position was posted for a role I am interested in. A recruiter contacted me about this same position. What are the pros and cons of using them vs applying on my own?

I'm assuming my chances of getting the role are higher using them but the pay is less? Any feedback would be great!
