Should I Accept Job Offer Even Though it is VERY Bad Timing?
TL;DR - Mixed feelings about accepting likely job offer since it is very bad timing for my current company. 

I have been at a large F100 company for about four years and I am hoping I will receive an external offer tomorrow for my dream job at a fast growing start up (different industry). I had a great round of interviews yesterday and the recruiter told me I was the only candidate who made it to this stage. 

I am worried I am going to burn bridges at my old company, even with a two week’s notice, since my last day would be the same as our top contributing team member, who is going on maternity leave.

I have been training with my pregnant team member to take over a portion of her role while she is on leave. This is going to be very difficult for them, but I am so excited about this potential position, I don’t think I can turn it down without major regrets.

To make things more interesting, I also just received a promotion and a 10% raise one month ago.  And they paid for my MBA (clawback expired earlier this year). 

Is there any way I can avoid burning bridges with my current team?  I feel like I am being incredibly selfish and experiencing major guilt.  Any advice on how to handle this sticky situation would be greatly appreciated.
