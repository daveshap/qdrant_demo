Arizona and California Join the Small List of States In Which a SNAP Recipient Can Purchase Food Online With Their EBT Card
>U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue today announced approval for  Arizona and California’s request to provide online purchasing of food  to SNAP Households in the States of Arizona and California. This  approval will allow the states to expedite the implementation of online  purchasing with currently authorized SNAP online retailers with a target  start date later this month.

>The [SNAP online pilot](https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/online-purchasing-pilot)  is currently operational in Alabama, Iowa, Nebraska, New York, Oregon,  and Washington State. Nebraska joined the pilot on April 1, 2020.  Maryland and New Jersey remain non‐operational pilot states. The  authorized retailers working with all pilot states are Amazon and  Walmart, while Wrights Market and ShopRite are working with Alabama and  New York respectively. Dash’s Market, Fresh Direct, Hy‐Vee, and Safeway  are authorized retailers, which are not currently operational.

>Though the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Food and Nutrition  Service (FNS) is receiving interest to expand the SNAP online pilot  program, the responsibility is on state agencies, their third-party  processor, and any retailers who wish to participate. To ease the  process, FNS put together a simplified template for states who wish to  enter the online pilot which is provided as an attachment to this  letter.

I don't know where to find the attachment that is the template for states.

I do know that it's imperative that anyone receiving SNAP in states that aren't currently on the list of online purchasing to contact your state elected officials to urge them to implement this capability ASAP.

Not only because of coronavirus, but for always.
