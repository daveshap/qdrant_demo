CHRISTY: Goddamn it!
MARY ROBERT: Mary Clarence!
MARY ROBERT: Oh my Lord!
CHRISTY: Experience!
MARY ROBERT: What was all that? Who was that man? Why would he shoot at us?
CHRISTY: I don't know, some people just don't like nuns. I wish I had a ruler.
MARY ROBERT: We could have been killed! But you saved me! Thank you, Mary Clarence!
