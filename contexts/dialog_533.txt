SANDRO: Then you should also be able to tell me where a young girl might stay in Noto; are there any hotels or rooming houses?
MIDWIFE: There's the Trinacria Hotel... or the Regina, near the municipal building. As for rooming houses, I don't know...
SANDRO: Thank you.
MIDWIFE: Don't mention it... Pleased to be of service any time.
