QGIS does not export heatmap SLD-files At the moment I am creating a webmap with PostGIS and GeoServer. I want to style the data using SLD-files, because my data keeps updating.I have made SLD-files for Points and Polygons and that worked. (I imported the data in QGIS, then styled the data and exported the SLD-file, which I then imported as a style in GeoServer. When I changed the data in the database, then (for example) the color changed of the polygon in the WMS-layer created by GeoServer.)Now I did the same with a heatmap. I imported the data in QGIS, made a heatmap and tried to export a SLD-file. Unfortunately, this does not work. The file contains the following sentence:FeatureRendererV2 heatmapRenderer not implemented yet-->I cannot use this SLD-file now for GeoServer.What do I need to do to make this work?
