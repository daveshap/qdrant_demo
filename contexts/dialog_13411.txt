RAND: It seems we are having dinner by ourselves, Miss Connell. But I may as well introduce everyone to you, anyway. There -- in the master's chair, sits the master -- my half-brother Paul Holland. But you've already met him.
BETSY: Yes -- on the boat.
RAND: And that chair -- is the particular property of Mrs. Rand -- mother to both of us and much too good for either of us. Too wise, in fact, to live under the same roof. She prefers the village dispensary.
BETSY: Is she a doctor?
RAND: No -- she just runs the place. She's everything else -- amazing woman, mother. You'll like her.
BETSY: I like her already.
RAND: And that -- is my chair. And this -- is Miss Connell -- who is beautiful.
BETSY: Thank you. But who sits there?
RAND: My brother's wife.
