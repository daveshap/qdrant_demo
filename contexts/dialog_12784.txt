HILDY: Come on, Mollie. This is no place for you.
MOLLIE: They're not human!
HILDY: They're newspaper men, Mollie. They can't help themselves. The Lord made them that way.
MOLLIE: It wasn't the Lord! It was the devil!
MURPHY: You guys wanna play some more poker?
ENDICOTT: What's the use? I can't win a pot.
WILSON: Who? Hildy Johnson? She just stepped out. She'll be back in a second. Who? Oh, Mr. Baldwin. Well, if you'll hang on a minute, she ought to be right in. All right.
WILSON: Baldwin. The blushing bridegroom -- himself.
SCHWARTZ: What's he want?

WILSON: Phone for you, Hildy.
HILDY: Who is it?
WILSON: Oh, some insurance man. Are you in?
HILDY: Give me that!
