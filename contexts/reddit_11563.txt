Trivial girl problems
I have this thing that has been nagging in the back of my mind since the beginning of the summer.  

I've known this girl for a couple of years now and we are good friends.  I have never really seen her as a friend until she got off a bad relationship and I was by her side from the fallout.  We would have talks and such and I really think we had our "moments".  My feelings got the best of me and I started liking her and would think she would feel the same way.  Well flash forward to this summer and she starts dating another guy.  I don't know if I should tell her I had these feelings for her while she is dating this guy as I would be considered a home wrecker.  A part of me wants to tell her how I feel but another part tells me to not do it.  However, if I don't tell her then I will loathe myself for not getting my feelings out.  It's just weird and I haven't talked to her in a month since then.  Sorry for the paragraph
