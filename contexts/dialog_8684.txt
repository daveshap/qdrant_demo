CLEMENTINE: Oh God, how horrid.
JOEL: I'm Joel.
VOICE-OVER: No, it was lovely.
CLEMENTINE: Hi, Joel. So no jokes about my name?
JOEL: You mean, like... Oh, my darlin', oh, my darlin', oh, my darlin', Clementine... ? Huckleberry Hound? That sort of thing?
CLEMENTINE: Yeah, like that.
JOEL: Nope. No jokes. My favorite thing when I was a kid was my Huckleberry Hound doll. I think your name is magic.
CLEMENTINE: This is it, Joel. It's gonna be gone soon.
JOEL: I know.
CLEMENTINE: What do we do?
JOEL: Enjoy it. Say good-bye.
JOEL: So you're still on the Zoloft?
VOICE-OVER: Next thing I remember we were walking down near the surf.
CLEMENTINE: No, I stopped. I didn't want to feel like I was being artificially modulated.
JOEL: I know what you mean. That's why I stopped.
CLEMENTINE: But my sleeping is really fucked up.
JOEL: I don't think I've slept in a year.
CLEMENTINE: You should try Xanax. I mean, it's a chemical and all, but it works... and it works just having it around, knowing that it's there. Like insurance.
JOEL: yeah?
CLEMENTINE: I'll give you a couple. See what you think.
JOEL: Okay.
CLEMENTINE: Have you ever read any Anna Akhmatova?
JOEL: I love her.
CLEMENTINE: Really? Me, too! I don't meet people who even know who she is and I work in a book store.
JOEL: I think she's great.
CLEMENTINE: Me too. There's this poem --
JOEL: Did this conversation come before or after we saw the house?
CLEMENTINE: I think, before.
JOEL: Seems too coincidental that way.
CLEMENTINE: Yeah, maybe.
CLEMENTINE: Do you know her poem that starts Seaside gusts of wind
JOEL: Yeah, yeah. It goes Perhaps there is someone in this world to whom I could send all these lines"?"
CLEMENTINE: Yes! I love that poem. It breaks my heart. I'm so excited you know it. Look, houses in which we don't live.
CLEMENTINE: I wish we did. You married?
JOEL: Um, no.
CLEMENTINE: Let's move into this neighborhood.
JOEL: I do sort of live with somebody though.
CLEMENTINE: Oh.
CLEMENTINE: Male or female?
JOEL: Female.
CLEMENTINE: At least I haven't been barking up the wrong tree.
CLEMENTINE: Cool.
JOEL: What are you doing?
CLEMENTINE: It's freezing out here.
JOEL: Clementine.
VOICE-OVER: I couldn't believe you did that. I was paralyzed with fear.
CLEMENTINE: C'mon, man. The water's fine. Nobody's coming here tonight, believe me. This place is closed up. Electricity's off.
JOEL: I hesitated for what seemed like forever.
CLEMENTINE: I could see you wanted to come in, Joel.
