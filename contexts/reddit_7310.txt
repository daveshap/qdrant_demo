What to expect and prepare for in Training
After looking for a job for a while I finally start training for my new job tomorrow. They have what I consider "Formal" Training because it's at a different facility going over procedures/policies/etc and then the following week I will be at my assigned location getting more hands on training. I've only ever had Informal training/hands on. Would anyone have an idea of how to prepare for this kind of training, what to bring besides the necessary paperwork and what to expect?.          I'm going into this feeling slightly unprepared and very nervous. Would appreciate any insight on this topic.
