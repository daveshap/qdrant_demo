JOANNE: Yes.
DULANEY: Well - I'm a little confused. This is a charge receipt from Rosen's Drug Store where Mr. Marsh had an account. It's dated the day of the murder. Is this your signature?
JOANNE: Yes.
DULANEY: There's an item you picked up that's marked. Will you read it?
JOANNE: Dristan nasal spray.
DULANEY: Would you read for us the time of the purchase?
JOANNE: Three fifteen.
DULANEY: A.M -- or P.M.?
JOANNE: P.M.
DULANEY: You see that's what bothers me. No other bottle of nasal spray was found in the house. The police looked. There was only the one bottle. But you say you didn't arrive until after Mr. Marsh was dead -- yet we know he was using the nasal spray prior to his death. How do you think it got there?
JOANNE: I don't know.
DULANEY: Isn't it true that you stopped by the house after you left the drug store and dropped off the items you bought?
JOANNE: No.
DULANEY: Isn't it true that you put the cocaine in the bottle?
JOANNE: No! Why would I want to kill him?
DULANEY: Because you were jealous. Because he cut you out of the will. Because you have a cocaine habit to feed -- because you know that if Rebecca Lawson is found guilty the new will is void -- and there's a very good chance the old one would be honored.
