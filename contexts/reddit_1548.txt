Unpopular Opinion: a lot of y’all don’t belong at top schools.
Alright so basically what I’ve noticed about people who get into top schools that I’ve been friends with is that they’re all nice people and actually have a life. If you have to study 24/7 and don’t have time for a social life just to maintain good grades and good test scores, you don’t belong at a top school. The people who belong at t20s are the people who actually have a life and passions beyond ‘I need a 4.0 GPA and 36 ACT’ they’re just smart enough to get the 4.0 and 36 on top of that. Y’all really need to chill because frankly not having a life is ruining your chances. When you look back and think ‘why did I get deferred/denied? I had a 4.0, I studied every single hour, I joined 7 different ECs just for this college’ then that is exactly why you got deferred/denied. Sure, there are some exceptions. But colleges don’t want people with no outside competence and no perspective which so many of you display them wonder why you’re not getting in to your top choices.

Edit: just because you didn’t get into a top school doesn’t mean that you necessarily have no personality! Top schools are always hard, getting rejected even with good scores could be a lot of reasons

Edit2:  I’m apologize to any 1 specific person who read this and got upset. I am sure you have a life. I never tried to say that you didn’t, you can have exactly 7 ECs but still have a life. The number was arbitrary, I didn’t mean to offend anyone with the post it was just my opinion.
