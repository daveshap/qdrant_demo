CLUETT: I was crazy, I tell you, Mr. Dickson. I didn't know what I was doing. I wandered around in a daze. All I could think of was that they were going to kill me . . . You'll stand by me, won't you, Mr. Dickson? You won't go back on me now, will you? I'll die if they send me to prison!
INSPECTOR: Don't forget there's a dead watchman downstairs.
CLUETT: I didn't kill him! I had nothing to do with that, I tell you! I was home in my apartment last night - I can prove it!
INSPECTOR: Claims he was there with a married woman. Doesn't want to mention her name.
CLUETT: He won't believe it, Mr. Dickson. But it's the truth - honest it is. I was in my apartment last night - ask your wife - she—
DICKSON: My wife? What's she got to do with you?
INSPECTOR: No wonder he didn't want to mention her name.
DICKSON: What was my wife doing in your apartment last night?
CLUETT: Nothing, nothing, Mr. Dickson. Don't pay any attention to me. I don't know what I'm saying.
DICKSON: You just mentioned her name. What was she doing there? What was she doing in your apartment?
CLUETT: She just came up for a drink. Just for a few minutes.
DICKSON: You're lying!
INSPECTOR: Don't worry, Mr. Dickson. We'll find out whether he's telling the truth. I'll have a man from headquarters check up on it right away.
DICKSON: You don't want to check up on anybody. I'll do all the checking up. Wait a minute.
DICKSON: Helen!
HELEN'S VOICE: Yes?
DICKSON: Get Mrs. Dickson on the phone.
DICKSON: Listen, dear. I want to ask you something. I know it's a silly thing for me to ask you, but . . . I want you to tell me the truth. Where were you last night?
MRS. DICKSON: Last night? Er - why - uh, last night . . .
DICKSON: Listen, dear. Now tell me the truth about this. Were you in Cluett's apartment?
MRS. DICKSON: In Cluett's apartment? Well dear, you see, I . . . I . . .
CLUETT: She wasn't to blame, Mr. Dickson. It wasn't her fault. Honest, it wasn't. I begged her to come up. She didn't—
DICKSON: Get out, get out!
