Why aren’t a lot of people majoring in Supply Chain Management?
I live in LA and I always wondered why not a lot of people aren’t majoring in supply chain? From using google and searching up CSU and UC why are the majority of people majoring in Business Administrator/ Management. I mean I read articles how supply chain is a growing field and it will be growing even more in the next decade and beyond. However, Im thinking you don’t have to major in supply chain in order to work in supply chain right? I‘ve seen people in accounting and finance working in supply chain And even becoming logistics mangers. So my question is does it matter if you have a supply chain degree or not in order to work in supply chain?

Forgot to mention I am majoring in both Accounting and Finance and wanted to see if it was better to major in Supply Chain Management or Business Management to work in supply chain.
