MELANIE: Ouch!
MITCH: I'm sorry. What are you doing up here?
MELANIE: Didn't you see the lovebirds?
MITCH: You came all the way up here to bring me those birds?
MELANIE: To bring your sister those birds. You said it was her birthday. Besides, I was coming up anyway.
MITCH: What for?
MELANIE: To see a friend of mine. Will you please be careful?
MITCH: I'm sorry. Who's your friend?
MELANIE: Why...
MITCH: Yes?
MELANIE: Annie. Annie Hayworth.
MITCH: Well, well, small world. Annie Hayworth.
MELANIE: Yes.
MITCH: How do you know Annie?
MELANIE: We... we went to school together. College.
MITCH: Did you! Imagine that! How long will you be staying?
MELANIE: Just a few... just a day or two... the weekend.
MITCH: I think we'll have to shave the hair. Deke, have you got a razor?
MELANIE: Oh, no you don't!
MITCH: It's still bleeding a little. Here, let me put this on.
