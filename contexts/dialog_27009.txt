LUKE: Do you need me anymore? Cause I'm going to bed. They can stay up talking another 45 minutes if they want, but I gotta try to get some sleep.
MARROW: Go ahead.
THEO: If this was some sort of joke, I'm going to kill him.
NELL: You know it wasn't a joke, Theo.
MARROW: The cold sensation. Who felt it first?
NELL: Theo I think. You've asked us that three times, Doctor Marrow. What's going on?
MARROW: How do you feel about Luke's suggestion that it was just the old plumbing? Water hammer, something like that?
