I was sexually assaulted at work and I want to leave the firm, but I have only been working there for 6 months. How do I handle the “why are you leaving?” question while interviewing?
Basically what the title says. I am a 24yo woman in finance. This is/was my dream job. I love my team.

Unfortunately, I was sexually assaulted by a partner at my firm a few weeks ago. I anonymously reported the incident and there was some investigation, but nothing came of it. I don’t feel comfortable coming forward publicly — though this isn’t the point of this post.

Despite therapy and medication, I don’t think I can deal with the anxiety anymore and I want to find a new job. I have recently put out a few applications and have a handful of calls coming up.

How do I deal with the question of why I am choosing to leave my current firm, especially when 6 months in?
