MARVIN: That fucking bastard! That fucking sick fucking bastard!
MR. ORANGE: Marvin, I need you to hold on. There's officers positioned and waiting to move in a block away.
MARVIN: What the fuck are they waiting for? That motherfucker cut off my ear! He slashed my face! I'm deformed!
MR. ORANGE: And I'm dying. They don't know that. All they know is they're not to make a move until Joe Cabot shows up. I was sent undercover to get Cabot. You heard 'em, they said he's on his way. Don't pussy out on me now, Marvin. We're just gonna sit here and bleed until Joe Cabot sticks his fuckin' head through that door.
FREDDY: Say hello" to a motherfucker who's inside. Cabot's doing a job and take a big fat guess who he wants on the team?"
HOLDAWAY: This better not be some Freddy joke.
