We’re familiar with the idea that porn obscures one’s views of relationships, but I think rom-coms have altered my views of love and relationships!
As far as porn, many are probably familiar with the idea that it is not realistic and can give its viewers an unrealistic idea of what to expect during sex, or in a relationship. However, I think my love for rom-coms has altered my views of what to expect of men. 

I am realistic, but at the same time I think I may be expecting too much. I just love how in the movies, the men are chivalrous, kind, and caring, and will usually have something going for them. Whether it is they have established themselves in a good career, or they learn the error of their ways and excel at whatever it is they become passionate about. They’re usually somewhat attractive, and take care of themselves and aren’t afraid to come forward when they are interested in a woman. 

I don’t expect all of this, but it’s just something I love seeing in the movies, and hope to get something similar but not 100%, eventually. What do you all think?
