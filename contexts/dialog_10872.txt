DANA: I want you inside me.
VENKMAN: I don't know. You've got two people in there already. It could get a little crowded. I want you to close your eyes and relax. Now I'm going to speak to Dana and I want Dana to answer.
DANA: I am Zuul. I am ...
VENKMAN: Right ... You're the Gatekeeper. But I want Dana. Dana, speak to me ...
DANA: There is no Dana. I am Zuul.
VENKMAN: Whoa!! Nice voice.
