Does Yubikey 4 support multiple OpenPGP encryption keys or only one? When my OpenPGP encryption key expires, and I want to generate a new one, can I keep the old one on my Yubikey 4, or will I have to reencrypt all of my encrypted files/emails with the new key?  If I do have to reencrypt everything to the new key, is there documentation on how to do this? Note that I am using a key that is generated directly on the device itself, so that it is more secure.
