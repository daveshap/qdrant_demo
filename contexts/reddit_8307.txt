What are the pros and cons of the US building a wall along the entirety of the US/Mexico border?
One of Donald Trump's core campaign promises [beginning from his very first campaign event](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/trumpometer/promise/1397/build-wall-and-make-mexico-pay-it/) has been to build a wall on the southern border of the United States and make Mexico pay for that wall.

In 2006, Congress enacted a law which provided for [approximately 700 miles of fencing along the US/Mexico border.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Fence_Act_of_2006)  That program was the basis for [Trump's executive order relating to constructing a wall.](https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/01/25/executive-order-border-security-and-immigration-enforcement-improvements)

What estimates have been put forth for the cost of constructing a wall?  How effective has border enforcement been recently?  What can we learn from the Secure Fence Act in terms of the logistics and pitfalls of a project like the one Trump has proposed?
