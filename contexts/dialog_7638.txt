DR. THURMAN: And when I clap my hands together twice, you will wake up. Do you understand?
DONNIE: Yes.
DR. THURMAN: So, your parents... why did you disappoint them?
DONNIE: I... I was playing with fire.
DR. THURMAN: Is it Frank who wants you to destroy the world, to set the world on fire?
DONNIE: People get hurt.
DR. THURMAN: But it was an accident. The house was under construction.
DONNIE: People get hurt. I don't want to hurt anyone.
DR. THURMAN: But you were punished.
DONNIE: Yes. I went to jail.
DR. THURMAN: Do you wish that you were punished by your parents instead?
DONNIE: They... didn't buy me what I wanted for Christmas that year.
DR. THURMAN: What did you want for Christmas that year?
DONNIE: Hungry Hungry Hippos.
DR. THURMAN: How did you feel... being denied those Hungry Hungry Hippos?
DONNIE: Regret.
DR. THURMAN: What else makes you feel regret?
DONNIE: That I did it again.
DR. THURMAN: You've done it again?
DONNIE: Yes. I flooded my school... and I burned down that pervert's house. I think I only have a few days left... before they catch me.
DR. THURMAN: Why did you do these things, Donnie? Did Frank tell you to commit these crimes?
DONNIE: I have to obey him... because he saved my life. He controls me and I have to obey him or I'll be left all alone... and I'll never figure out what all of this means...
DR. THURMAN: If God exists?
DONNIE: I think now that he might...
DR. THURMAN: Why?
DONNIE: Because I'm so horny.
DR. THURMAN: God exists because you're horny.
DONNIE: I think so. I think that's one of the clues. It's a clue that tells us... to keep going.
DR. THURMAN: Where are we going?
DR. THURMAN: Where are we going, Donald?
DONNIE: I have the power to build a time machine.
DR. THURMAN: How is that possible?
DONNIE: Grandma Death will teach me how. Soon.
DR. THURMAN: Then how is time travel possible?
DONNIE: It would have to be God's portal. They will lead me to it. Then I will go back in time... and I won't feel regret anymore.
DR. THURMAN: When will this happen?
DONNIE: Soon. Time is almost up.
