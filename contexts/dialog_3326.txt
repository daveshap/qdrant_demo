RAND: ... We're prisoners, Mr. Gardiner - we're prisoners of tubes and technology.
CHANCE: I agree.
RAND: ... You will join us for dinner, won't you, Mr. Gardiner?
CHANCE: Yes. I am very hungry.
RAND: ... So am I, my boy - so am I.
RAND: I know exactly what you mean. Today the businessman is at the mercy of kid-lawyers from the SEC. All they want to do is regulate our natural growth! It's happening across the country!
ALLENBY: To everyone, I'm afraid. The Government controls are so restricting that the Medical Profession, as we know it, is being legislated out of existence.
RAND: Of course! By kid-lawyers!
EVE: Won't your injury prevent you from attending to business, Mr. Gardiner?
CHANCE: No. It won't do that.
EVE: ... Would you like us to notify anyone for you?
CHANCE: No. The Old Man died and Louise left.
EVE: Oh. I'm very sorry. Well, if you have any need for any of our facilities, please do not hesitate to ask.
RAND: Do you need a secretary?
CHANCE: No, thank you. My house has been closed.
RAND: Oh. When you say 'Your house has been closed', you mean to say that your business was shut down?
CHANCE: Yes. Shut down and locked by the attorneys.
RAND: What'd I tell you? Kid-lawyers! The S.E.C.! Damn them!
EVE: I hope that staying here won't be an inconvenience for you.
CHANCE: No. I like it here.
RAND: That's good, Mr. Gardiner. Or may I call you Chauncey?
CHANCE: Yes. Chauncey is fine.
RAND: And I'm Ben.
ALLENBY: ... And please call me Robert.
CHANCE: Yes, Robert. I will.
