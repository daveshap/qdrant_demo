Men who define masculinity by stereotypes are the most pathetic people on the planet.
Beer drinking, sports watching, cat calling, blue collar jobs, cigars, poker, hatin' queers, bar fights, huge steaks, giant trucks, and slammin' hot chicks.

Literally none of these things make you masculine. They make you a tool, because you're letting somebody else dictate your identity to you, usually advertisers. 

These people spend their whole lives living in the boundaries of "If you don't do **X**, you're not a REAL MAN and I'll fuckin fight you!"

Just be yourself, for fucks sake.
