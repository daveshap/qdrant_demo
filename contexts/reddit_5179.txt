One thing I have consistently learned the hard way: the only way to know if you have gotten the job is if you get an offer
I have attended way too many interviews where I felt I nailed the interview and I was sure I had gotten the job. I have been told my written assignments were the best. Only to get a regret letter. Pro tip: after the interview no matter how good it went, move on and act as if you did not get the job. I just received my latest rejection letter and just moved on to my next application. 

EDIT: whoa, you guys have had worse experiences than myself. To update, the only way you know you have gotten the job is get an offer letter, have it in written formed and signed, and getting paid the first salary.
