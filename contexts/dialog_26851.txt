RIPLEY: I keep wanting to do that -- fling open the door -- let the light in, clean everything out. If I could get a huge eraser and rub everything out... starting with myself... the thing is, Peter, if...
PETER: No key, huh?
MARGE: Hello Peter, so good to see you.
RIPLEY: Hello Marge!
MARGE: Tom.
MARGE: So you found Peter...
PETER: I think we sort of found each other.
PETER: Where's Dickie's father?
MARGE: He's not coming till the morning. Evidently his stomach -- I don't think the food here is agreeing with him.
RIPLEY: I was looking forward to seeing him.
MARGE: Dickie hasn't killed himself. I'm sure of that. There's a private detective on the case now -- a Mr MacCarron -- Dickie's father's employing him.
RIPLEY: That's a terrific idea.
MARGE: He's American. He's already discovered Dickie cashed checks for $1000 the day before he disappeared.
