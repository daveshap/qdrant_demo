CHRISTINE: Oh, great. I just hitched a ride with a bunch of potheads... I'm hooking up with some people at this funky place in downtown Detroit called Disco Inferno. Mind droppin' me there?

CHRISTINE: What the hell is that supposed to mean?
JAM: It doesn't mean anything. Don't pay attention to him.
HAWK: Disco Inferno? Disco's infernal morelike.
