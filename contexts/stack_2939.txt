When a point particle moves with a certain vector instantenous velocity along a curve, does it have a vector instanteneous acceleration? I'm sorry I'm just getting started with Physics, I'm not an expert. I've been stuck with this question.When a point particle moves with a certain vector instantenous velocity along a curve, does it have a vector instanteneous acceleration? My professor said that it depends on the vector instanteneous acceleration. Though I don't understand why.When I look at the graph I always see that the acceleration is the slope of the graph. Any hints?
