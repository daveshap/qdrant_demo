WADE: I can see what you looked like as a kid.
MARGIE: You knew me as a kid.
WADE: Yeah, but never what you looked like. Not really. Never really studied your face, like now. I was never able to see you as a kid when you were a kid until now, this way.
MARGIE: What way?
WADE: After making love. I like it. It's nice to see that in a grown-up person.
MARGIE: It's nice.
MARGIE: Don't you think, do you still think it's a good idea to press this custody thing -- just now?
WADE: I'm her father -- supposed to be, but I'm not able to. Yes. Yes, I am. It may be the only thing in my life I've been so clear about wanting. Even if it takes a big fight.
MARGIE: Then... I guess you have to.
WADE: There's another thing I've been thinking about. I don't know how you feel about the idea, Margie, because we've never talked about it. But I've been thinking lately, I've been thinking we should get married sometime. You and me.
MARGIE: Oh, Wade.
WADE: I've been thinking about it, that's all.
MARGIE: You've been married twice --
WADE: It was to the same woman. I was just a kid... It's not like a marriage proposal or anything, just a thought. Something for you and me to talk about and think about. You know?
MARGIE: Alright. I'll think about it.
WADE: Good.
