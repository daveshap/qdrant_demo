VIOLET: Shelly was skimming from the business. He came to see me yesterday because he was afraid Caesar figured it out. He wanted to run but he wanted me to come with him.
CORKY: Even though he knew about you?
VIOLET: Yes.
CORKY: He was in love with you, right?
VIOLET: That's what he told himself. But it wasn't even about me, it was about Caesar. He wanted what Caesar had. That's how they are. I understand them.
VIOLET: For Shelly, taking the money was a way to take from Caesar. He could have run at any time, but he didn't because he didn't want out.
CORKY: Sounds like he wanted to get caught.
VIOLET: Maybe he did. He would brag to me all the time. He was never afraid of Caesar because he didn't know him. Not like I do.
VIOLET: Caesar lives for these moments. He tells me it's just the business, but I know it's more than that. He likes it. The violence. I'll catch him in the bathroom mirror touching his scars. He says they remind him who he his. They're all like that. Except maybe Mickey.
CORKY: Mickey?
VIOLET: He's the part of the business that the rest of them pretend to be. |But Mickey doesn't like it like they do. I suppose that's why he's good at it.
