How do I know if I already have disenchanted a trait? In ESO, you can disenchant traits on armor and weapons for creating that same trait on new armor and weapons.Is there a way to know if I've already disenchanted the trait on an item? I'd like to know if I can go ahead and sell the item or hang on to it to disenchant it later.
