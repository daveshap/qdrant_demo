FRANK: Bank out us a couple more men to run the cattle.
TOM: We should be fine, then.
JOE: Teacher asked me why we raise Black Angus-Herefords 'stead of Pure Herefords.
FRANK: Tell her they suit the weather better. Their udders are black, 'stead of pink.
TOM: They don't get burned by the sun bouncing off the snow. And they're good mother.
FRANK: Our daddy raised Pure Herefords.
ANNIE: You know, that's interesting. I always wondered when I went into a restaurant what was the difference between a regular steak or a Black Angus steak. I couldn't taste any difference although I could swear one was more tender. I didn't know there was that big a difference between cows... I've never been on a cow farm before. I must say, the bulls seem to have the best time of it. Just laying around the fields all day until they're asked to... do their... work.
FRANK: Well, get born a bull, got a ninety percent chance of getting castrated and served up as hamburger. On a balance I reckon I'd choose being a cow. Would you mind passing that salad young lady?
DIANE: How's Peterson's holding up for you?
ANNIE: It's fine. Comfortable. I still can't get used to how dark it gets around here, though. When we leave the ranch, I always hold my breath until I can see the motel.
