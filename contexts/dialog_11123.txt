BETTY: You picked up that girl right in front of me.
CLAY: Hey, no strings, right? That's what you always said. Just good pals who have the hots for each other.
BETTY: It still hurt. A lot.
CLAY: I didn't mean to...
BETTY: No, I'm actually kind of glad it happened. It made me wonder what the hell I was doing with my life. Letting you pull me into bed whenever the spirit moved you.
CLAY: You liked it too.
BETTY: Sure. I loved it.
CLAY: If you enjoy it, you should do it.
BETTY: You know, I just can't do that anymore. I still have time to get things right. Get married again --
CLAY: You mean us?
BETTY: The look on your face! You're not marriage material. You're not even boyfriend material. You're a kid. A big, fun, slightly irresponsible kid.
CLAY: I'm not a kid.
BETTY: What are you then? What will you be ten years from now? Still cutting lawns? Still banging horny divorcees in your trailer?
CLAY: I like my life. I'm a free man.
BETTY: Sure you're free, for now at least. But how long before you're just alone? Pathetic and alone.
CLAY: So you don't want to fuck. That's what you're telling me?
BETTY: Is that all this conversation means to you? Am I going to put out or not?
CLAY: Damn straight. I'm sick of playing games.
