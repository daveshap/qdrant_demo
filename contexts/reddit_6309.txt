Question about Social Security Card as an Identifier?
Many companies today want to actually see your actual Social Security Card as part of their hiring process.  I get it:  "Under his Eye".

I heard on talk radio that some companies/agencies will not accept the older Social Security card that states on the bottom "Not to be used for identification purposes". These are typically cards from your parent's generation.

Can anybody bring me up-to-date and either confirm or deny this?  Thank You.
