Nearly 30 and still unsure what I would like to do as a career that I enjoy. Can anybody give me advice based on my situation?
So as the title states I’m nearly 30 and having trouble finding something I would like to do that I enjoy. Currently I’m working at a call center as an escalations supervisor. I graduated with a degree in business admin (definitely something I regret).

When I was in college I really enjoyed my accounting classes and heavily considered changing my major to that. Also,I do like employee to employee Human Resources work. I’m interested in doing something in the medical or tech field as well but wouldn’t want to go back to school if it would take more than two years.

I’ve been doing a ton of research and introspection to get a feel of what I would be interested in but I’m really overwhelmed.  Any good sources or advice on how get going in the right direction?
