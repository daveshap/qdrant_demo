Company asked me to make a template for them but ghosted me right after. Was I scammed?
Had a phone interview at a startup last Thursday and it was the weirdest thing ever. She never really asked me about what I can do for their company or even tried getting to know me. I felt like they were milking information off me such as asking, "So at your company, what programs or tools do you use for x and x" and even asked me to make THREE templates that their company can use to reach out to influencers/businesses. She told me to get it done ASAP and so my stupid self did. I made a two page template plus a detailed explanation on why I think this would work for them. I submitted it Thursday, followed up yesterday (Tuesday) but never got a reply.

I felt like they just wanted to use me to to make a template so they can use it themselves for their own good. It's kinda annoying when you get rushed into creating something you're not getting paid for and then just get ghosted after. Smh.  

context: I work in marketing with an emphasis on social media. Only a year of experience
