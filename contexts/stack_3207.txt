Chimps save the life of a crewmate Read this novella a while ago. I think it was on Asimov magazine. It was about a trial where the sole survivor of a spaceship was trying to end a program where chimps were traveling with humans and they had cut the arms and legs of the crewman in order to save his life. The chimps spoke using sign language. It has an epic ending where he realizes that they sacrifice themselves in order to save him. Anybody know the name and/or author?
