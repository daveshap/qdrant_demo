DENNIS: You got something to say?
MARS: I like it here, Dennis. I'm never going to leave.
DENNIS: Fuckin' A.
JENNIFER: What do you want?
KEVIN: Keep your voice down. I'm taking you and your brother out of here.
JENNIFER: What happened?
KEVIN: Do you want to go or not? I'm offering you a way out of here.
JENNIFER: I can't go without Thomas.
KEVIN: All three of us will go, but we have to move fast. Mars and Dennis don't know I'm doing this.
JENNIFER: How can we get out?
KEVIN: Dennis and Mars are in the den. I'll get your brother, then come back for you. We'll go down the stairs and out the front door, you understand?
JENNIFER: Yes.
