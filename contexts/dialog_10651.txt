MURPHY: Ever heard of the Mary Celeste?
EPPS: Nope.
MURPHY: She was a two-masted brig boat sailing out of New York in 1872. One day she was sighted off the coast of Portugal by a merchant vessel, the Dei Gratia. As the crew of the Dei Gratia got closer, they discovered that no one was at the helm of the Mary Celeste. On boarding, they found her completely deserted. The captain, his wife, their daughter, and the entire crew, all gone. The last entry in their log made no mention of any trouble. The table was even set for dinner. And in the nine days after the last entry, she sailed 700 miles without anyone aboard.
EPPS: So what did happen?
MURPHY: Nobody knows. There've been a lot of theories, of course. But we'll never really know for sure.
EPPS: You think she's sailing without a crew?
MURPHY: I think we'd be surprised where a drifting ship might wind up with a little wind and the right current.
EPPS: You're more practical than superstitious.
MURPHY: Only way to be.
MURPHY: What's this?
DODGE: Turbine rotor's shot.
MURPHY: I thought you said it was just a blade.
DODGE: Metal's crystallized. Gotta replace the whole deal.
MURPHY: How much longer's that gonna take?
DODGE: Like I always say --
MURPHY: I know I know, two ways to do anything --
DODGE: The right way and the wrong way.
MURPHY: But how long?
DODGE: Hard to say.
MURPHY: We gotta get outa here, Dodge. A storm blows up and we're history.
DODGE: I'm telling you, you don't want to be running that fan like it is.
MURPHY: What about running number two by itself?
DODGE: It's a full 2500 horses down. We couldn't drag that boat down hill on ice with it.
MURPHY: How long, then?
DODGE: I gotta pull the blades and re-seat everything in a new rotor -- .
MURPHY: How long?
DODGE: Three, four days.
MURPHY: Goddamit, Dodge.
DODGE: What do you want me to tell you, that we can throw this sucker back in and start pulling her like nothing happened? Can't do it, skipper.
