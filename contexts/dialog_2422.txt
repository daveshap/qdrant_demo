DEBBIE: What do you think's gonna go on at the guys' party?
BOBBIE: They'll probably get drunk, and watch dirty movies. But don't worry about the dirty movies.
DEBBIE: What do you mean?
BOBBIE: I forgot to tell you. Yesterday I found a bunch of pornos in the back seat of O'Neill's car.
DEBBIE: You're kidding.
BOBBIE: Nah. Everything's cool... I took care of 'em.
