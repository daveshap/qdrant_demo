SEAN: This is where to be. High and dry.
KELLY: And alone.
MIKE: What's wrong?
KATHRYN: Nothing.
MIKE: ... If nothing's wrong, why are we stopping here?
KATHRYN: ... Electrical connection malfunctioning.
MIKE: You sound like Houston Mission Control. What the hell does it mean?
KATHRYN: That we swim.
MIKE: Swim where? Out there? Oh, no, forget it, not me! You go, I'm staying.
KATHRYN: Michael, the sub's dead.
MIKE: Yeah, and so will I be if I start swimming in that blackass jungle.
KATHRYN: Okay, stay. We'll come back for you.
MIKE: Where are you going?
KATHRYN: Up.
MIKE: And leave me down here???
KATHRYN: Make up your mind.
MIKE: What mind? If I had a mind, I'd never have let you talk me into this.
KATHRYN: I talked you into this?
MIKE: I'd have fallen in love with a pilot or a mountain climber.
KATHRYN: Are you coming...?
MIKE: No, I don't want to leave now. I'm having too good a time... Of course I'm coming! You'd think you're gonna leave me?
MIKE: You would, wouldn't you? I'd end up whale shit, you wouldn't care.
KATHRYN: Get your reserve bottle and let's go.
KATHRYN: You all right?
MIKE: I think so. I'm not sure... Are you?
KATHRYN: I'm okay.
KATHRYN: Michael...
MIKE: It's all right, baby. We're safe...
