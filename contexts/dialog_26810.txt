STEVE: Colonel. He had no sisters, no brothers, only a lot of love affairs.
DYMSHITZ: Anyway, Major, why should he leave his country, his mother tongue, his family, his history, his past, his future, just because now, suddenly, there is a dictatorship? Why?
STEVE: But what... before that turns rotten... What if they surround the space with barbed wire, Colonel?
DYMSHITZ: Don't talk about things you know nothing about. He was in a dictatorship!
STEVE: Yeah, yeah, art and politics, yeah, yeah, I heard all about that.
DYMSHITZ: In a dictatorship, art belongs to the Party. If you want to be a conductor, you have to have an orchestra. And you can only get an orchestra if you have contact with the power. All over the world you need the right contacts and you have to make the right compromises.
STEVE: This is what I'm saying. He must have had Party contacts.
DYMSHITZ: There are good Party members who help, and there are dirty non-Party members who inform on you. Of course, they gave him privileges.
DYMSHITZ: And suddenly, Steve, suddenly you notice that they like you. They honour you, suddenly you are the director of the best museum in the world, for example.
STEVE: What museum?
DYMSHITZ: I'm sorry. Museum? Not... I said orchestra. Sorry. Believe me. Help me, Steve. You say you answer for someone from high up. I, too, have orders from high up. Very high up. We want Furtwängler. I'll give you in return the whole orchestra, four, five conductors. I need him, Steve.
STEVE: No can do.
DYMSHITZ: Let Furtwängler go. Please.
STEVE: I have a duty.
DYMSHITZ: Duty? I am sorry, duty? Duty fucking duty. Trouble is, you Americans want everybody to live like you. We liberated Berlin, Major Steve, not you. Our duty also is to bring back the best of German culture.
STEVE: I'm gonna get that fucking bandleader, Colonel. No deal. No fucking deal.
DYMSHITZ: Then you're going to kill me.
