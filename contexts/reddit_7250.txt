Job training is taking way too long
My manager is basically the only one who trains me. In past jobs I was trained not only by the manager but others who were either the main person who did the specific process, whomever was the most proficient or whomever had the time. This manager has not made enough time. I have been there several months and should have been trained in most areas of the job description. The team I work with understand the slowness but it doesn't help that I cannot help them at the level I should be. 

This boss has many meetings during the day and has lagged a lot on my training. And lately when I have been trained it is during my lunch time (east coast time sucks). No apologies that it is my lunch time. Then, I miss certain things within the office when they have a social gathering for a celebration. Although this is minor, I have missed the lunch because I could not get up. I had to ask someone to save me something. I have been through this before when meetings and training has been on my lunch time. But I wish managers would let others train me who are actually in the office. It shows no trust in others. I work with people who have been their a long time. I think it is also a control issue. I get frustrated when I am still doing the same thing day after day. My bosses manager called me one time to apologize that my training is taking too long. I think she was nervous that I would get fed up and quit. I read the reviews on Glassdoor that training was slow but not like this. I had wondered if this manager was doing it on purpose but they need me way too much. I am good at what I do. I just wish they had a more formal training structure. 

I like the office, the work an the people, but the training needs to be changed. I would think if my manager's boss called that things would pick up. Nope. Nothing happened for two weeks. I just feel like it is not prioritized.
