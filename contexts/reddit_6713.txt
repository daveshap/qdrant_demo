Saying no to a candidate when they have more interviews scheduled?
Hey all,

So, say a candidate has 7 interviews scheduled but after 3 everyone agrees it's a no. How do you handle this? What would you tell to the candidate?

Thanks in advance!

Edit: thank you all for your thoughts! To clarify, I’m referring to a situation when a senior person has 1 day of interviewing, only with different people, managers, peers, so it’s technically multiple meetings. 

As someone in the comments said, some of these are more for the candidate to figure out if they want to work there just as much as it is for the company. It needs to be a match on both ends.
