I hate my life right now as an American.
There's no more structure.  There's no more rules.  There's chaos everywhere and there's no end in sight.  All the positive momentum I had built up before shit hit the fan is now gone.  I'm barely keeping it together.  I'm running out of money and I'm running out of medication.  I'm terrified to go back to work because I know they won't protect me.  I've become pre-diabetic in quarantine because of a culmination of bad habits, and I have no money to see a doctor about it.

I honestly don't know how to proceed.  I'm frozen in fear of every option.  I barely eat.  I have no sleep schedule anymore.  I don't know what to do with myself.  I don't want to be here anymore.
