Huge tip for people who don’t seem to ever attract interest from people
I’m soon to be 22 (M) and I’ve always gone into social situations the same way every single time until a couple of months ago. I always used to get barely any attention from girls at all no matter the situation and I’ve only just worked out one of the huge mistakes I’ve been making for years. 

Every single time I used to meet up with people, I would always have this mindset that I was interested in a girl and wanted to go out of my way to talk to them. Every time I socialised, my primary focus was on a girl. I’m a fairly awkward guy, conversation and normal shit doesn’t flow great most of the time and flirting ain’t easy. I’d leave every social event/situation depressed and upset that nothing happened between me and whoever the girl was. Recently, I’ve been going out and actually enjoying myself. Forgetting about the fact there may be a girl I’m attracted to there. Being around people is so much easier now that my main goal for the night is simply to have a good time with no agenda, and surprise surprise, I’m getting some interest from girls now. 

Moral of the story is, I don’t give a fuck how long you’ve been single for. The only people that do are family members. I was single for 5 years, longer when you consider the only relationship before that 5 years was a month long. Go out and have fun with your friends. Doesn’t have to be a club either, just have fun whatever you’re doing. Forget about girls. It seems counter intuitive but think about what they’re seeing. The weird guy sitting in the corner looking nervous or the guy having a good time, laughing, smiling, you get the picture. Go and have a good time guys. You’ll start to enjoy life a lot more and maybe get a bit of interest. 

Good luck and I hope this helps some people. My DMs are always open
