JACKIE: The Jacket. That's what they call it, right?
STARKS: Yeah.
JACKIE: It was banned, you know... and it led to an investigation of Dr. Becker's mistreatment of some of his patients. That's when they found out how badly he was drugging his patients...
JACKIE: But no one knew until after...
STARKS: After I...
JACKIE: [Beat] You bled to death.
STARKS: What?
JACKIE: I don't know how you got the cut to your head, but you died bleeding from it.
STARKS: Do you really believe me?
JACKIE: I don't know. [Beat] I thought I was crazy after you left that day. I died. I still think I could be crazy. But then I replayed that night in my head -- the parts of it I could remember -- and it was like...I don't care if I was, or am. I haven't felt that way in a room with someone my whole life. [Beat] And when you left, all I wanted was...
JACKIE: [Softly] I want to trust you. Should I trust you?
STARKS: Yes.
JACKIE: Then we need to figure out what happened to you. It's the only thing we can do.
STARKS: I know.
JACKIE: Alpine Grove still exists. I looked it up on the net. We should go there and see if there's still anyone around who might have known what happened to you.
STARKS: If they don't take me out before then. [As an afterthought] What's the net?
STARKS: I didn't kill Officer Harrison.
JACKIE: I know.
STARKS: How? Did they figure it out after I died?
JACKIE: No. They never figured it out. I did. Most murderers don't stop to help a drunk woman and her little girl on the side of the road. Not without hurting them.
DR. MORGAN: I'm sorry I can't tell you more about your father's death, Mr. Starks. Our own medical examiners determined only that he died from a blunt trauma to the head but that was right around the time the Alpine Grove's staff changed and I'm afraid we didn't have the best record system before then.
STARKS: His body was found on January 1, 1993, but do you know if that was long after he had died?
DR. MORGAN: No, I don't. I'm sorry. I wish I knew more.
STARKS: What about Dr. Thomas Becker or Dr. Loel Lorenson? There was also a Dr. Gries, I think.
DR. MORGAN: Well, Dr. Lorenson is still here at the hospital. If she was here at the time your father was, then I'm sure she'd be of more help to you.
STARKS: What about Dr. Becker and Mr. Gries?
DR. MORGAN: Unfortunately, I'm not familiar with Dr. Becker and Dr. Gries passed away three, four years ago.
