LIBRARIAN: Come on Brenna, your ass is already in a sling, don't drag me into it.
BRENNA: All I need is for you to check the name.
LIBRARIAN: You talked to your supervisor lately? He's burning up the place about you just dropping out of sight. That on top of the cops bugging him.
BRENNA: I'll take care of that Corey, but I need this now.
BRENNA: Corey, you _owe_ me.
LIBRARIAN: It's that important?
BRENNA: Yeah.
