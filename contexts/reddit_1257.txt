to everyone reading this ...
to everyone reading this, thank you for still being here. anxiety is a bitch! nobody likes the draining feeling in your gut. that shakiness in your hands. that awful self-doubt. YOU ARE HERE! youâ€™re defeating it every time you open your eyes the next morning. 

keep in mind that you are a fierce ass human being! only you can do what YOU can do! you are powerful, you are strong. and you are deserving of love! 

have a wonderful day today, tomorrow, next week, next month, next year, and onward! fuck anxiety!
