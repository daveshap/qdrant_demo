My friend is copying me.
Well I'm pretty young and I think that I have a lot of achievements for my age (14) I know how to write code in c#, I play piano, and I make animations in Maya / Blender / Cinema 4d but I have a friend that can't stop trying to do everything that I do. For some reason in the last year, he decided to do everything I do. He decided to start learning blender, write code in python, learn how to play piano, and I can't stand it. maybe I'm exaggerating but it's awful. it's like he doesn't want me to have my own personality. I don't want to talk to him about my life because every time I do he starts doing it again.
