BERNSTEIN: You think we're being set up?--Christ, Deep Throat tells you last night that the letter came from inside the White House and up traipses Marilyn naming names.
WOODWARD: It makes a crazy kind of sense-- remember that initiation rite they have at the White House? Each new member of the President's staff has to prove his guts by getting an enemy of Nixon.
BERNSTEIN: You think this was Clawsen's initiation?
WOODWARD: Could have won him a fraternity paddle with a White House seal. God knows it worked.
WOODWARD: You claiming it was all a misunderstanding, Ken?
CLAWSEN: Absolutely--Marilyn's gotten it totally wrong--
WOODWARD: She's an awfully good reporter--I can't remember her getting too much wrong before, can you?
CLAWSEN: That's a bullshit question, that's a question straight out of Wichita, Kansas.
WOODWARD: Sorry, Ken; listen, one last thing: where did your talk with Berger happen?
CLAWSEN: Where? What do you mean, where?
WOODWARD: Well, was it in a bar, her apartment, some restaurant--
CLAWSEN: --I've completely forgotten where it was, except I know it wasn't her apartment.
