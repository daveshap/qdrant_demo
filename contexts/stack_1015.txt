How can I create a linux os in ram from a USB without booting it? How can I create a linux os in ram, so it does not have to booted from the PC?I can install linux os in a USB stick, but there is no program to run it from within windows, but I can do this from a CD??If I want it to be transportable, I cannot guarantee I will have access to the boot control, so that is a non starter. But the \"Live\" editions all seem require to be booted!
