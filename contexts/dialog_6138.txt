DANTE: What are you talking about?
SUITED MAN: According to the NJAC-the New Jersey Administrative Code, section eighteen, five, slash twelve point five-a fine of no less than two hundred and fifty dollars is to be leveled against any person reported selling cigarettes to a minor.
DANTE: I didn't do that!
SUITED MAN: You said you were here all day?
DANTE: Yeah, but I didn't sell cigarettes to any kids!
SUITED MAN: An angry mother called the state division of taxation and complained that the man working at Quick Stop Convenience sold her five-year-old daughter cigarettes today at around four o'clock. Division of taxation calls the State Board of Health, and they send me down here to issue a fine. You say you were working all day, hence the fine is yours. It's doubled due to the incredibly young age of the child.
DANTE: But I didn't sell cigarettes to any kid!
TRAINER: To a five-year-old kid? What a scumbag!
HEATHER: That's sick, Dante.
DANTE: I didn't sell cigarettes to any kids! I swear!
SUITED MAN: The due date is on the bottom. This summons cannot be contested in any court of law. Failure to remit before the due date will result in a charge of criminal negligence, and a warrant will be issued for your arrest. Have a nice day.
DANTE: But I didn't sell cigarettes to any kids! Hey!
TRAINER: Forget it. I don't want to deal with a guy that sells cigarettes to a five-year-old. Can I offer you a ride somewhere?
HEATHER: Sure. How about the beach?
TRAINER: I like the way you think.
