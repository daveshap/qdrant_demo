Online Matches
I (F24) see lots of guys on reddit and IRL complain about the lack of matches they get, and how many matches women get. The guys i know, plus the guys on reddit also swipe right on every single girl they see to make their chances better. Understandably so, cast the net wide, you'll be bound to catch something. I cant speak for every girl, the the girls i know dont swipe on every guy, they are a bit choosy, hell, my BFF will send me screenshots of guys profiles and ask me what i think, and we'll talk about it before she makes her decision, thats just before she even swipes right, for all she knows, he might not like how she looks. it got me thinking about how women and men play the online dating game very differently.

If every guy swipes right on EVERY girl, and every girl swipes right on SOME guys, of course women are going to have more matches. It's over-saturated at this point. Also, just because a girl may have 100+ matches, it doesn't meant that shes talking to 100+ guys. 1/2 of them are bots or catfishes, i guarantee it, many dont answer, LOTS are looking for one night stands and hookups, and then there are maybe a handful out of that group of men are are actually compatible with the woman they matched with. i admit, i get lots of matches, and i message them, but not everyone talks to me, because even though they swiped right on me, i'm not their preference. Ive had guys swipe right on me, i say hello, and then immediately unmatch me lol. It happens to us all!

Not to mention, people have different tastes, i know its hard to not compare yourself to some Calvin Klein model looking dude and think, "if he isnt matching with every woman, what chance do i have". But you have to remember, not everyone likes that, people have different tastes and preferences. I'm short, and i am VERY hesitant on going out with guys over 6 feet, because it feels weird to me, i know that guys who are over 6 feet tall are popular online for some reason, but know that not every girl likes it. Yes, online dating is extremely shallow, and i get my ass kicked on it too, i'll be the first to admit it, but it is a good way to meet people, and not every meetup needs to end in a relationship, maybe a friendship can come out of it. If you find yourself getting in a dark place mentally from these apps, take a break from them, its ok, i do it, my friends do it, your peace is the most important part of this

Men, please dont think i am diminishing your struggle with online dating, because that isnt the point of this post. Women have to wade through A TON of bullshit on these apps, and i think its nice if we can see each others perspective from time to time. Please, just safeguard your mental health on the battlefield of love.
