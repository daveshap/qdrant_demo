FOWLER: You got no business snoopin' around --
HELEN: Me snoopin'? I came down here to take a bath.
HELEN: That something I shouldn't see?
FOWLER: No. But it's mine and I didn't want anyone foolin' with it.
HELEN: What is it?
FOWLER: Just a thing I was workin' on.
HELEN: The way you act, it must be something pretty secret.
FOWLER: Go on. Take your bath. I'll beat it.
HELEN: You wouldn't have a smoke on you, would you?
