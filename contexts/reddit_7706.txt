Grad School pathway decision?
Thinking of re-applying to grad school (ph.d and master) eventually, like a year to two.

Just learned my friend got into a Biol-Ph.d program. Which, I am thrilled for him and makes me wonder if I can get into a chemistry ph-d program. Granted, I knew my friend was going to get in regardless due to his accomplishments. (multiple summer research, conferences, grad school support program, Undergrad thesis etc.)

Compared to me who did a couple years of research and will wrap a undergrad thesis.

I was applying last Fall but, stopped after one of my letter of rec writer felt as the letter she would have written wouldn't do much to the application process. (A polite no basically.) She is a professor who sits in our lab meeting and contributes, but is in a different field altogether.

I love the research process, but I believe it wont matter due to my lack of accomplishments compared to my friend who got into his program. So why waste the extra money, even though I already took the GRE.

And, I am going to start a job in the chemistry industry real soon anyways.

I actually want to go to graduate school, but have no way of getting there when looking at what I have done so far as a undergraduate.
