GEORGE: Your nose ring comes out of your nose. If you've got them in your nipples, they come out, too. And there's no make-up at my house. No glue sniffing. Huffing. No pills, no grass.
SAM: If you hit me, I'll call the police.
GEORGE: You've worn out your welcome at this house, Sam. I won't ever hit you. This may well be the worst three months of your life, but you've earned it. So, pick up your suitcase and go get in the truck. Now.
SAM: I'll hate you forever.
GEORGE: You can't even begins to know how much I hate my father. Think of it as a family tradition.
