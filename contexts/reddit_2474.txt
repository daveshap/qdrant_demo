Achieved my dream job, but am now realizing that maybe money is more important to me? Anyone have any advice?
I’m 27 years old and got the job I always said I wanted as a kid. I became a zookeeper. I went to school and got my bachelors degree in Environmental Science and have now been working as a zookeeper for a little over 2 years. I absolutely love the job and wake up most days happy to go to work. Growing up I listened to the advice of “do something you love, and you’ll never work a day in your life”. Which I guess is true but I am now realizing it may not be feasible/sustainable to live off of the amounted income for the rest of my life. There is pretty much no room for growth, very little to no pay raises or promotions, and you make the same amount as someone who has been working there for 30 years. 
I love the job and the work but I think my life outside of work is more important to me. Having to work weekends and holidays isn’t ideal. Paying rent, bills, buying groceries is tough with this pay and I have no savings accumulating. After having worked my ‘dream job’ and knowing what it is like, I have decided that making more money is more important to me to be able to have a better life outside of work. I want to be able to afford a house and a family someday and have enough money in order to be comfortable and not have to stress and worry so much about bills. 
Anyone have any advice as to what I should do? Anything at all would be great.

Edit: thank you to everyone who responded it is greatly appreciated. Looks like I have a lot to think about. What a great community this sub is. Very sound advice from a lot of you.
