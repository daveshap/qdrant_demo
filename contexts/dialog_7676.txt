BUGGIN' OUT: Every single one of those pictures is somebody Italian.
JADE: And?
BUGGIN' OUT: And I--we--want some Black people up.
JADE: Did you ask Sal?
BUGGIN' OUT: Yeah, I asked him. I don't want nobody in there, nobody spending good money in Sal's. He should get no mo' money from the community till he puts some Black faces up on that motherfucking wall.
JADE: Buggin' Out, I don't mean to be disrespectful, but you can really direct your energies in a more useful way.
BUGGIN' OUT: So, in other words, you are not down.
JADE: I'm down, but for a worthwhile cause.
BUGGIN' OUT: Jade, I still love you.
