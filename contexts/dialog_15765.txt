MONTCALM: That's where a lead bullet has torn you.
MAGUA: And this?
MONTCALM: My son has been sadly injured. Who did this?
MAGUA: Magua slept hard in the English wigwams. And the sticks left their mark... Magua's village and lodges were burnt. Magua's children were killed by the English. Magua was taken as a slave by the Mohawks who fought for the Grey Hair. Magua's wife believed he was dead and became the wife of another. The Grey Hair was the father of all this. In time Magua became blood-brother to Mohawk to become free. In his heart he always was Huron. And his heart will be whole again on the day when the Grey Hair and all his seed are dead!
MONTCALM: My son Magua's pain is my pain.
MAGUA: Does the chief of the Canadas believe the English will keep the terms?
MONTCALM: Munro would. But General Webb will not send their soldiers across the salt lake. Having let them go, I fear I will only fight the same men again when I move south. And yet, I cannot break the terms of the capitulation and sully the lilies of France...
MAGUA: Many things my French father cannot do, Magua can.
