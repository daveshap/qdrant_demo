Should I update my waitlist schools with these new circumstances?
So, I have severe life circumstances going on that I never mentioned in my application for any of my schools that I have been waitlisted at.

I was waitlisted at Cornell and Emory (both oxford and emory).

So, I almost died these past few weeks. My former step-father grabbed a gun and shot through our window a few times (he has extreme PTSD and is a former veteran so he gets insanely crazy sometimes). He talks his way out of things and hides his evidence. The reason he's mad is because we have custody of his son (which is my step brother, we have the same mother but diff dads) and he's been trying to do anything to get custody of him, which is why he tried to kill us. Today, Sunday May 10th, my mom is getting arrested (in a few hours when the police are scheduled to come) because of some issues I don't know. This will make me homeless as we're already a very low-income house hold.

Do you think I should mention this in my application? I'm just trying to make sure they have a clear understanding of what is going on in my life right now. I haven't told them anything other than that I live in a single-parent house hold. I've avoided saying this because I didn't want to make a sob story, but I don't know if I should mention this now.
