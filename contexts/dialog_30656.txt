SYLVIA: Did you see it come down?
CLAYTON: Yes...I was fishing up in the hills.
SYLVIA: You must have caught plenty with all that tackle!
CLAYTON: Oh - there were three of us. The others flew back in my plane. I don't understand why a meteor this size didn't make a bigger crater.
SYLVIA: It hit sideways and skidded in.
CLAYTON: What's that fellow over there trying to do - dig it out?
SYLVIA: He's top man in astro and nuclear physics. He knows all about meteors!
CLAYTON: You seem to know a lot about him.
SYLVIA: Well, I did a thesis on modern scien- tists - working for my Masters degree.
CLAYTON: Did it do you any good?
SYLVIA: Why, sure -- I got it! Do you have a match?
CLAYTON: I'm sorry. I don't smoke.
SYLVIA: Forrester's the man behind the new atomic engines. They had him on the cover of 'Time'. You've got to rate to get that!
CLAYTON: Aw, he isn't that good...!
SYLVIA: How can you say that when you don't know him!
CLAYTON: I do know him...slightly.
SYLVIA: What's he like?
CLAYTON: Like...ah...
SYLVIA: Well, you certainly don't look like yourself in that get-up! But I am happy to meet you anyway. I'm Sylvia Van Buren. I teach Library Science over at USC.
CLAYTON: I didn't know how to stop you...!
SYLVIA: I might have recognized you without the beard. And you didn't wear glasses on the 'Time' cover!
CLAYTON: They're really for long distance. When I want to look at something close... I take them off.
