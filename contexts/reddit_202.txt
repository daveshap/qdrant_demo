Shy guy problems
I'm kind of shy so I don't necessarily get my feelings out to the lady folk because I think that they will reject me. I finally did give my feelings out to one person I have a crush on. She liked my back but not the point. I don't know anything about dating. I simply said I liked her and she liked me back. Anything you guys can tell me about first dates? I'm Hopeless!
