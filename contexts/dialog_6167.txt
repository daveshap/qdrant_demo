QUALEN: Talk. No tricks, no codes, no messages. You haven't found us. It was a fake call.
HAL: Jessie, I reached the top of the Tower. So far, no sign of anyone. Looks like a phoney call. Over.
JESSIE: You gotta be kidding me! Do you want me to fly up after you? Over.
HAL: <u>Negative</u>. The winds are too high. I'm going to ride out the storm here. I'll take shelter in the Douglas Exhibition Shaft. Over and out.
TRAVERS: Have her come up.
HAL: The down drafts would wipe her out. It's the only chopper. If it goes, you got no ride out.
