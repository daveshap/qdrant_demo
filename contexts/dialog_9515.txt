WOUNDED BARTENDER: How have you been?
JACK: ... You know me?
WOUNDED BARTENDER: Is this a test, sir?
JACK: Yes... it's a test.
WOUNDED BARTENDER: You were in here last Thursday night.
JACK: What?
WOUNDED BARTENDER: You were standing right where you are now, asking how good our security is. It's tight as a drum.
JACK: Who do you think I am?
WOUNDED BARTENDER: Is this part of the test?
WOUNDED BARTENDER: You're the one who did this to me. You're Mr. Durden, sir. Tyler Durden.
JACK: Please return your seatbacks to their full upright and locked position.
MARLA: Yeah?
JACK: Marla, it's me. Have we... have we ever had sex?
MARLA: What kind of stupid question is that?!
JACK: Because the answer's yes" or because the answer's "no?""
MARLA: Is this a trick?
JACK: Will you just answer me, for Christsake?!
MARLA: You mean, you want to know if I think we were just having sex or making love?
JACK: We did make love?
MARLA: Is that what you're calling it?
JACK: Answer the question!
MARLA: You fuck me, then snub me. You love me, you hate me. You show me your sensitive side, then you turn into a total asshole! Is that a pretty accurate description of our relationship, Tyler?
JACK: We've just lost cabin pressure.
JACK: What did you say... ?
MARLA: What is wrong with you?
JACK: Say my name.
MARLA: What... ?
JACK: Say my name! What's my name!?
MARLA: Tyler Durden! Tyler Durden, you fucking freak. What's going on? I'm coming over there...
JACK: Marla, no, wait...
