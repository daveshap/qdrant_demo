MAUDE: Good afternoon, Officer. Bit of trouble here?
OFFICER: Yes, ma'am. Somebody had some trouble parking.
MAUDE: Well, it's a tricky turn.
OFFICER: Eh, yes, ma'm.
MAUDE: Tell me -- -- is that car parked all right?
OFFICER: Oh yes. That's fine.
MAUDE: Well, thank you. Eh, officer, you might turn off the radio. Saves the battery.
MAUDE: Oh, my. We're too late.
HAROLD: Is he all right?
MAUDE: He's fallen asleep, as usual.
MAUDE: We'll come back in the morning.
HAROLD: What is that he's working on?
MAUDE: An ice sculpture. It's Venus - the Goddess of Love, the completion of which is his unfulfilled dream.
HAROLD: It is kind of rough.
MAUDE: He's never finished one yet. He has around him every kind of hand tool known to man, but the poor dear has difficulty staying awake.
HAROLD: Look, the ice is melting.
MAUDE: Yes.
