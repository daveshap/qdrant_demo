TRAPPER: She had this shiny black hair piled up on her head, but later on she let it hang loose and I'll be damned if it didn't come all the way down to her ass.
DUKE: I've always had a hankering for blonde pussy myself. My wife's hair is a wonderful golden yellow, and this time of year it gets even lighter.
HAWKEYE: I guess that's why you go for Hot Lips Houlihan.
DUKE: You know damn well I nearly puke when I look at her. I don't even think she's a real blonde.
HAWKEYE: How can you say a thing like that about an officer in the United States Army?
DUKE: I not only say it, I'll back it up twenty buck's worth.
HAWKEYE: You got yourself a bet, Georgia boy. You're a witness.
TRAPPER: Okay, I'm a witness, but how do you prove who's right?
DUKE: There's only one way.
TRAPPER: It's five minutes into nurses' shower hour. Where are they?
HAWKEYE: They're coming.
HAWKEYE: Hey, Knocko, I got those pictures you promised to look at of my kids. You too, Wilma. It won't take a minute. You can see them too, if you want.
HOT LIPS: No, thank you. I'm not the slightest bit interested.
