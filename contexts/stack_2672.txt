Join touching lines in QGIS I have a boundary polyline of an island that is broken into multiple short segments. The island is surround by many other islands. What I want to do is delete the mainland island and convert the satellite islands into polygons. I tried dissolve but that merged the entire file into one feature. I then tried the multipart to single part thinking it would separate the smaller islands from the large one but it broke the entire file back up into the short segments again. Effectively I want to merge/dissolve touching lines so that each individual island is its own, one line feature.
