I make an extra $1,000 or more every month with beer money sites AMA!
Hey everyone. I [posted](https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/8asxdk/its_possible_to_make_an_extra_1000_a_month/?ref=share&ref_source=link) a few weeks back detailing how I am making upwards of $1,000 a month through the use of beermoney sites. Beermoney is, according to Urban Dictionary, "Extra money for non-essential payments, available for spending on luxuries, hobbies, or a fresh pint of your favorite draft." I use this definition, because this is (in most cases) not intended to be a primary source of income. This is a way to supplement what you already have. There is no way to know what you will make any given month, so do not count on it. My worst month I only made around $500 and my best I made over $2,000. 

As I have stated in my other posts, this is not a definitive list of everything a person can do online by any means. Do your own research on the subs I list, use Google, ask other people, and find what works for you. What I talk about works well for me, my family, and my schedule. Below I will explain why I chose this as a way to make money, provide a quick recap of the revenue streams that I have found to work, and provide payment proof for what I can. 

Since getting married, I have needed extra money for various bills and saving for things we wanted (down payment on a home). Essentially, I was just tired of barely scraping by every month after tax and savings. Because of this, I have been investing more time in all of these sites over the last 6 or 7 months and the cash flow has been steadily increasing as time goes on. I have been able to get my car paid off a little sooner (I am 3 months ahead on payments), have been able to afford more luxuries like taking the wife out on weekly dates, and have built my emergency fund to six months of bills. I am now also able to wake up and see that money came in while I slept. It has been rad.

I personally invest anywhere from 20 to 30 hours a week doing these sites, on top of my day job. Some days I will make $20 all day, and others I will make over $200. I prefer this, as opposed to a second job, because I can pay partial attention to a laptop and 'clock-out' when I want to focus on family or Netflix, rather than having to listen to another boss everyday, worry about getting fired, and deal with more people. This works better for my temperament and my preferences. 

The tech required: A working laptop, a cellphone (in some cases), an internet connection, and a fairly good amount of patience to learn. If you are in a position where these tools are not available, you can also do many of these from a library. 

I put all of this info into an e-book, plus another 80 pages of content. I tried to make it free, but Amazon requires a $0.99 minimum (still free with Kindle Unlimited). So, if you're interested, it can be found [here](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07HT46CQR?pf_rd_p=d1f45e03-8b73-4c9a-9beb-4819111bef9a&pf_rd_r=RFDQ1E7D2RN3X26A3126).

These are combined numbers over the last six to seven months.  Anyway, on to the revenue streams (some refs):

I know this is a lot of information and a bunch of it is repetitive from my last post, but I wanted to provide as much info as possible right off the bat. If there is anything that is confusing or additional you would like to know, fire away. 

Want to know about me personally? Do I like pineapple on pizza? Want to know other sites that work that I don't use? Want to know why I don't use other big money making sites? Want to know which ones are scams? The main benefits and downsides of any of the listed sites? I will be around most of the day, so... Ask Me Anything!
