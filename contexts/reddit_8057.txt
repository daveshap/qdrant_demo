Financial Advice for International PhD Student Starting in Fall 2019
Hello fellow Redditors, 

I have got accepted for a PhD in the United States with a fellowship that I believe will be very adequate for the monthly expenses. However, I have a couple of questions on the practicality of initially embarking on my studies. I would be thankful to hear your opinion and experience on these questions.

1. When did you move to the US? My classes start in the first week of September. I think I need to settle in before that. How in advance 
2. How did you finance yourself for the first months before getting your first stipend? Did you get stipend in advance for the first month.
3. I understand that there will be costs upfront like housing advance. How did you manage these? I do not have a lot of savings. Did you get any assistance from the university?
4. Did you buy one way tickets or return tickets for the flights to the US?
