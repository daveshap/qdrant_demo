Moments like these make me so happy
I was having troubles sleeping tonight, so I decided I'd just get on the PC and play CS:GO until I felt tired enough to sleep. I went to deathmatch and hit "go", and then I got sent to a game. First thing I noticed when I got to the "terrorist / anti-terrorist" screen was that the entire game was filled with bots, except for one person. When I started playing, I heard a younger boy crying on the mic. I decided to grab my mic and ask him if he was okay. He said he was on a game with a bunch of "big kids", and they made fun of him for his voice, and they booted him out. I started talking to him and told him about my personal story about being bullied and stuff like that. After a while, I asked him if he wanted to join a game with me that had actual players. He said yes, and as we both picked the same team, I said over the mic, "Let's get 'em, dude!", and he excitedly said, "Yeah, let's get 'em!" And... Our team lost. But he didn't care. He was just so happy that he had someone nice to game with that wouldn't make fun of him. We can all learn a lesson from this. At one point in our lives, we all were in his shoes. What we need to do is make sure that we're all taken care of. ðŸ–¤
