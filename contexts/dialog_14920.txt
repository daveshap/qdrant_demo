JOHNSON: There have been a number of reports in reputable news media - Time, Newsweek, our own NBC - that you have gone way beyond the legal means available to a prosecutor, that you've intimidated and drugged witnesses, bribed them, urged them to commit perjury. What is your response?
JIM: Your faith in the veracity of the major media is touching, Jerry. It indicates that the Age of Innocence is not yet over. But seriously, Jerry, people aren't interested in Jim Garrison - they want the hard evidence! They want to know why he was killed and what forces were opposed to...
JOHNSON: Some people would say you're paranoid.
JIM: Well, if I am, why is the Government concealing evidence?
JOHNSON: Are they? Why would they?
JIM: That's exactly my question, Jerry. Maybe I'd better show you some pictures so you can begin to understand what I am talking about.
