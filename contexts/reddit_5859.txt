Is university really that important?
All i hear is "go to university so that you can get a good job or won't amount to nothing", kind of.

But is it really true?

I dont want to spend other 5 years in a scholastic system, I hated "high school" (in my country there's not high school but another name), I want to be a real estate agent and build wealth with it, and then invest my money.

There are things I'm interested in learning like history philosophy or computer science but I prefer studying them by myself instead of spending 5 years at university with no income and being dependent on my parents, i want to live alone.

So, if you have already experienced this, is uni really that critical?

How's your working life been?
