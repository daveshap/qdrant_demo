FRANKIE: I'll be a monkey's kid sister! What d'you want to do a thing like that for?
JOCKO: 'Musta knocked her up.
FRANKIE: What're you gonna get out of it, huh?
DUFF: A whole lot, Frankie.
FRANKIE: Like what?
DUFF: Like a home, for one thing.
FRANKIE: You gonna sit at home the rest of your life? Jesus!
DUFF: Well, it's better than windin' up like a bum.
FRANKIE: What 'you signifyin'?
DUFF: I wasn't thinkin' about you, Frankie.
JOCKO: Ol' Doris sure goin' to miss you.
FRANKIE: Just give him a couple of months. A girl like that, she don't know any tricks.
JOCKO: You know what Doris told me? She say: That Duff's a nice guy. Wouldn't even charge him nothin'.
FRANKIE: I guess you'll be quittin' the railroad, huh, man?
DUFF: That's right.
FRANKIE: Man, you must be plumb outa your mind! You'll be makin' twen'y bucks a week, if you're lucky.
