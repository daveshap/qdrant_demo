Am I too old to find a work at home job?
My employer of 20 years has flipped her lid and been treating me like shit. Its so bad that everyone talks about it. She cut my pay by 50 dollars a week and I still have to work 53 hours a week. Only bring home 375 a week. She has stopped paying all of us with a paper check cause she got mad when she found out we did mobile deposit. Now she pays us cash and yesterday she paid me 375 dollars allin 5 dollar bills and smiled when she gave it to me. This is just a few of many evil things in the past month. But to get to the point I am 53 years old and I am an introvert and do not have reliable transportation so a remote.job would be perfect. I am semi intelligent I and I am a very slow typist but extremely fast reader and can comprehend what I read with ease even While skimming an article. I hate math but love words. I have no tech traing but can figure my way around a computer. I need to make approximately 11 dollars.an hour. I do not have a nest egg as I have to take care of my 84 year old mom that lives with me. So I can not quit until I have another job. I am literally sick to my stomach everyday at this job and I feel like I am running out of options. Are there any remote jobs that I could do at my age that do not involve call centers and great typing skills. I am not afraid of hard work cause its killing me now at my present job. Any suggestions would greatly be appreciated. Thanks
