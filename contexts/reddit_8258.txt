How does the number of resignations and firings during the Trump administration compare to past administrations?
In light of FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe [stepping down today](https://www.axios.com/fbi-deputy-director-andrew-mccabe-is-stepping-down-5e60dee9-3fe4-4b18-bf57-fb037c0faabb.html), adding to the [growing list of firings/resignations](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2017/12/14/white-house-departures-whos-been-fired-and-who-resigned-trump-administration/951641001/) (updated as of 12/14/17) of high-level Trump Administration staff, is this an abnormal amount of high-level job attrition? Or do they actually reflect fairly normal numbers?
