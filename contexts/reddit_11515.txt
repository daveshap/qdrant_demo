my boyfriend’s long list of exes is destroying me
I know people do things they regret, and my [20F] bf [21M] was young when he dated the people he wished he never dated. But how do I come to terms with his past? I’ve never dated anyone before him, so sometimes I look at his dating experience and get jealous. Recently, I’ve been having nightmares about him cheating about me which I know deep down he would never do that to me. He loves me so much but it’s so hard to reciprocate due to my unsorted mental illness issues and insecurities. Sometimes, I get paranoia about someone from his past coming back. I get so sad about the idea of him doing NSFW things with people that weren’t me, and it makes me feel useless. Why can’t I just be okay with it? Does anyone relate to this? I am in so much pain over something that gave him so much suffering (tw: cutting) but my brain likes to manipulate the past and see myself as not good enough for him. I’m so pathetic.
