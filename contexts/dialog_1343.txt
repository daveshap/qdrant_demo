DICKSON: What time did this thing happen?
INSPECTOR: The clock opposite the vault was stopped by a bullet at 12:09.
DICKSON: All right. If the boy proves an alibi, he's all right, isn't he?
INSPECTOR: If he can do it, yes.
DICKSON: Why, certainly he can. Matt, now all you've got to do is tell them where you were last night, between twelve and twelve-thirty, and everything will be all right.
MATT: I already told him I was home.
DICKSON: There you are.
INSPECTOR: That's what he says. I got a man from headquarters checking up on it now.
DICKSON: Good. You've got nothing to worry about. Soon as the report comes in, you'll be released. And listen, don't talk so loud. Take it easy. Coast a little.
