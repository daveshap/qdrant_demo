Exporting text based PDF from ArcMap using ArcPy? I'm trying to create a report style output from ArcMap or ArcGIS Pro. The first page would be a map of a state with all locations of restaurants that are in the state. Then there would be a second page that gets exported that is a list of all of the restaurants from the first page map, sourced from a field in the data table. Before I chew away at writing a python script, does anyone know if the second page is possible from ArcGIS or at least Python?
