Just got laid off. Negotiating severance & job market at end of year
I just got laid off, and the only silver lining is that they're willing to offer more than their standard severance, to 6 weeks (when the standard, according to them and the amount of time I was there, is 2 weeks).

I'm still concerned, though, because this is the end of the year and I understand the job market is usually softer around this time (I've been in CPG digital marketing for a decade). The severance would only take me into mid December. (I have money saved up, but still)

&#x200B;

In this case, #1 what's a good way to go about negotiating severance? My performance record was good, and in all fairness politics is the biggest reason I got laid off.

\#2 Is the job market really that much softer at the end of the year? I haven't applied for jobs at this time of year before.

Thanks!
