How do I help a friend
So yesterday morning I was rald that my friend's dad passed away by a heart attack. My friend and her mom are currently in their home town. 

(Take in account that we havent talked alot recently, since school and drama always got on our ways.) 

I have no clue in what to say to her

What should I do?
