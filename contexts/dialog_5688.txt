JODY: Hi mom.
MARGE: Hi princess.
JODY: Mom?
MARGE: Yes?
JODY: I need to ask you something.
MARGE: You can ask me anything.
JODY: Have you ever heard of someone named Lisa Sherman?
MARGE: Lisa Sherman?
JODY: Yeah. Who is she?
MARGE: I don't know. Where did you hear that name.
JODY: I overheard daddy mentioning her to someone. I he thinks she's the killer.
MARGE: What?
JODY: That's what he said.
MARGE: Did he say anything else about her?
JODY: No but he got really weird. Like I've never seen him act. REALLY angry and super uptight.
MARGE: I've never heard of her. Maybe something else was on his mind.
JODY: No. I think she lived her a long time ago. Like twenty-eight years ago. When dad was eighteen.
MARGE: Not that I know of.
MARGE: Where are you going?
JODY: The library. I'll be fine.
