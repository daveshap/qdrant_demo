Have you ever gotten jealous over hearing about someone's suicide?
Now i did not personally know this guy, I left my town's school in 6th grade, and he moved to my town about a year or two after so I never went to school with him but I knew of him cause he hung out with my friends from town. Anyway, I am 24 now. A few days ago, I started seeing people posting "RIP" statuses on social media, and posting tributes to him with pictures and what not. Apparently, he was really depressed for awhile and finally decided he had had enough. At first I felt bad, and I still do. But then I started to feel really jealous, because since i was 12 i have been clinically depressed and have tried so, so many times in the past decade to kill myself, but it was never successful at it, and not a day has gone by that I haven't wanted to be dead. And apart of me is thinking "it's not fair that he got to die and i'm still here". Has anyone else ever felt like this?
