Does having a second screen/monitor help you be more productive and work more efficiently?
For those that are white-collar, work in 9-5's, or have a desk job that requires the use of a laptop, do you find that having a second screen, monitor, additional real estate help your productivity?

If so, what do you use it for? I currently operate on a laptop for work but I am wondering what could be made from a second screen.

Of course, one screen is required, but is two screens better than one? Does it help your productivity or work more efficiently?
