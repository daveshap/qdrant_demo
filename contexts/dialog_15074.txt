HAMMOND: You don't give us our due credit. Our scientists have done things no one could ever do before.
MALCOLM: Your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could that they didn't stop to think if they should. Science can create pesticides, but it can't tell us not to use them. Science can make a nuclear reactor, but it can't tell us not to build it!
HAMMOND: But this is nature! Why not give an extinct species a second chance?! I mean, Condors. Condors are on the verge of extinction - - if I'd created a flock of them on the island, you wouldn't be saying any of this! have anything to say at all!
MALCOLM: Hold on - - this is no species that was obliterated by deforestation or the building of a dam. Dinosaurs had their shot. Nature selected them for extinction.
HAMMOND: I don't understand this Luddite attitude, especially from a scientist. How could we stand in the light of discovery and not act?
MALCOLM: There's nothing that great about discovery. What's so great about discovery? It's a violent, penetrative act that scars what it explores. What you call discovery I call the rape of the natural world!
GENNARO: Please - - let's hear something from the others. Dr. Grant? I am sorry - - Dr. Sattler?
ELLIE: The question is - - how much can you know about an extinct ecosystem, and therefore, how could you assume you can control it? You have plants right here in this building, for example, that are poisonous. You picked them because they look pretty, but these are aggressive living things that have no idea what century they're living in and will defend themselves. Violently, if necessary.
