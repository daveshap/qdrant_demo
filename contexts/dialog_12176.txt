JAKE: Where is she?
MAST: I don't know.
JAKE: Where did you get that film?
MAST: I bought it at a store in L.A.
JAKE: Who made it?
MAST: I don't know.
JAKE: What do you mean?
MAST: Wait. Slow down. A film like this, 16mm, cost two three hundred dollars, sold outright, shown in peep machines, maybe theatres, maybe not, is almost impossible to track. 'Nobody' makes it; 'nobody' shows it; 'nobody' sees it. It's like it doesn't even exist.
JAKE: What's it called?
MAST: It was called 'Slave of Love' when I bought it. Next time it's sold, it'll be called something else.
JAKE: But the police...
MAST: The police? They know less than you do.
JAKE: Do you think she's safe?
MAST: Yeah. Probably.
JAKE: You like this, don't you. Showing me... this.
MAST: I hate it. But you gotta know, buddy. A lot of strange things happen in this world. Things you don't know about in Grand Rapids. Things you don't want to know about. Doors that should never be opened. I've known more about this sort of thing than a man should. Don't ask me why.
