So a guy buys you a drink....
So I am a female, sitting at a bar all alone, enjoying my afternoon. The guy from across the bar buys me a drink. The bartender brought it over. I look back to say thanks. The guy is actively looking the other way. He never comes over to talk to me. I finally see him go to the bathroom. So I walk over and ask his friend. "So is he ever going to come say hello.” He tells me he will mention it to him. So he comes out, and I can hear him in the background say, "Why do I have to go talk to her.” Long story short he finally does. So Reddit, what is the receptors cue when one buys a drink?
