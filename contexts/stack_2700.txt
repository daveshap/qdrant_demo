Converting Point Feature to Latitude/Longitude Coordinate and GPX? I drew a point feature using the draw tool in ArcMap on a map in an area of interest. I am now interested in extracting the actual latitude/longitude of this point in geographic space so I can actually navigate to this exact area in a car. In addition, I am interested in determining how to export this as a GPX feature and inputting it directly into my Garmin GPS device.
