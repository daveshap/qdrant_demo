Was Obama's Libya intervention that toppled Ghaddafi a good idea? What have been the long-term effects?
I recently read this article

which argues that the Libyan intervention was ill-advised, partly because its scattered arms and personnel from Libya to neighboring countries, which has only furthered instability in the region and the world.

I'm looking for a sound understanding of the reasons and merit of the Libyan invasion and the downstream consequences. Sources like books and articles are especially encouraged, and while they don't need to be politically unbiased I'd prefer they be well sourced and not purely polemical.
