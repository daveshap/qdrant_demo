PAUL: Oh, that one. That's me Grandfather.
GEORGE: That's not your Grandfather.
PAUL: It is, y'know.

PAUL: Oh, that's me other Grandfather, but this one's me Grandfather and all.
JOHN: How d'you reckon that one out?

JOHN: Well we know that but what's he doing here?
PAUL: Well, me mother thought the trip 'ud do him good.
