So I really fucked up at work after working here a year, I owned up to it and am still scared of the consequences
As the title says I made a mistake that basically impacted a few projects for a client of my company’s and I owned up to it immediately. I explained myself and how this was done when I was still fairly new and didn’t know as much, etc. because it did happen when I was new and not as well versed in things. 

Anyway, I’m still worried about all this because it’s a big fuck up but didn’t get the sense from my boss that it’s a fireable thing. I’m just trying to stay calm and not worry much about it but in the back of my head I’m obviously panicking. How should I deal with this? I’m not playing any blame game or anything and I owned up to it without playing dumb so I think I have some points for that at least.
