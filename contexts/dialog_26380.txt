ROSS: Gus, Webco, the Webster industrial complex, is a family-owned cartel. A little magnesium here, a little zinc there. Some railroads here, some farm machinery there. You follow?

ROSS: Gus, do you know what I want now? I want coffee!
GUS: Black or regular?
ROSS: I don't think you understand.
GUS: Man, what is this?
ROSS: Plants. Plants always make an office cozier.
