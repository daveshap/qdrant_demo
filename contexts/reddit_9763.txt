Taking a shot in the dark here. Advice?
Hey everyone, 

Looking for some advice here. I'm down to two schools for my SA masters, lets call them "White" and "Red" (disguising their identities just in case). The deadline to choose between schools is quickly approaching, April 15.

I'm one of three finalists for a Hall Director position at "Red," and I feel preeeety confident about it. I interviewed for five GA positions at "White," and I didn't get any of them. However, I feel more comfortable at White... And it's really where I want to be. But I worry about not having a GA Position, and not being able to find one on campus. 

Anyone have any advice on what to do/where you might choose? Ways to find a different GA or Full-Time position? 

I'll let you know the two schools via PM, if anyone wants. Just didnt want it in public. :) I'll also add more details if anything is missing, I'm admittedly typing on my phone so this may be light on details.
