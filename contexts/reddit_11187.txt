I'm terrified of how people are reacting to Asian people because of the coronavirus
Jokes were bad enough to start with, but I've read a stories of awful things people are doing to completely healthy Asian people. It's not even in Asian countries, just people who are seen as Asian being attacked, harassed and bullied. I've read about a teenager being attacked by classmates, a man having a heart attack being refused help by any passersby and so many things that are honestly awful.

I'm only part Chinese, but I have a Chinese surname and without my glasses, look 'Asian' according to friends/family. I feel on edge whenever I hear someone mention the virus, or joke about it because even at my college I'm just waiting for someone to turn on me. I've stopped wearing contacts so my glasses cover my eyes and I honestly no longer feel safe talking to anyone about my Chinese family or heritage.

I know I'm overreacting, but the things people are doing make me sick. They just want an excuse for blatant racism and they're getting it. I don't want to be scared of everyone around me just because of a virus that has barely come anywhere near our country.
