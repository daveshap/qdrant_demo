KIKI: It's all right. I'm not hurt.
JERRY: It was you, Galbraith!
GALBRAITH: No.
JERRY: It was you.
GALBRAITH: Not! I tell you. No!
JERRY: You shot the leopard. We know that. You killed Consuelo. You killed Clo Clo. Then tonight --

JERRY: Consuelo screamed too -- and Clo Clo. Why did you do it? Why? Quick. Tell me why?
GALBRAITH: It's better you don't know.
JERRY: Tell me.
GALBRAITH: Why do yo&amp;i accuse me? You don't know what you're doing -- you don't understand -- nobody understands --
