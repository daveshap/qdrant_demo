EMC test for PCB board without housing Our company is exporting our product to European market. To sell it to Europe we need CE mark. so we let the test lab test only EMC(EMI+EMS) because our products usually don't equip any RF nor AC power.Now, we are developing a board type product without housing. The board type product's purpose is very same to the Arduino. So the board can be used in lab. But it can be an IoT Gateway product when the end user implement a product by using our board. And the board doesn't include any RF part and it is powered by DC an adapter.I think that we need to the EMC test as same to the products which have enclosures.I have some questions at this point.When we do the electrostatic contact discharge, contact point should be all point where our fingers could be contacted. If we do the contact discharge test to the very important point, for example: MCU lead, it might be failed.Our partner test lab says we need an enclosure for the test of the non-housing board.Is it correct?How do you test for the board type products?cf. I have tried to find Arduino test report for reference but I have failed.Thank you very much.
