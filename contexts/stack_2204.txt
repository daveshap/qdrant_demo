Does your hat change your hitbox? In rocket league, there are a ton of Hats (not as much as TF2, but I digress)Does these hats change the hitbox of the car? Like if I have a big sombrero on, could the ball react differently when hit with the roof of the car that if I have the police light, or no hat at all?EDIT: I don't know if I am unclear with what I'm asking, but it feels so. Anybody get what I'm asking?
