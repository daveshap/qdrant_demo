BLAIR: Clark, did you notice anything strange about that dog? Just anything at all? Any little thing?
CLARK: No. Just that he recovered real quick... That night when I found him in the rec room, he had already scraped off his bandage. Before I put him with the others, I redressed his wound and noticed it had healed up real good...
BLAIR: That night?
CLARK: Yeah.
BLAIR: What was he doing in the rec room?
CLARK: Well, after I worked on him -- thought I'd let him rest. Left the room for a bit. When I came back, he was gone.
BLAIR: Well, where was he? Where did he go?
CLARK: Don't know. Looked for him for a bit... couldn't find him.
BLAIR: You're saying he wasn't put into the kennel until the night?
