Being a decent person shouldn't be seen as a positive, it should just be something you do.
I saw a post about it and other people agree, basic decency when it comes to dating seems to be at an all time low.  Some people act like they're nice and polite and "a good listener" like it's some kind of huge plus, when in reality it's something you should always be doing without thinking about it. 

Like look at it this way - I don't act like wearing a shirt when I leave my house makes me some kind of good person, I just do it.  Decency should be the same way - things like making sure the other person is comfortable with the place you're going, not pushing things on people they don't want to do, manners, not leading people on, letting people know you aren't interested instead of ghosting them - you should do these things because they are the right thing to do, not because you expect something in return from them.

And let me be clear, you can be decent and still keep your boundaries.  Like for example, if a guy doesn't want to go to an expensive restaurant, he can decline that if a girl suggests it and it doesn't make him an asshole, but it does if he does it anyway and expects something in return for it. Does this make sense? I promise you if you do these things, the right people will notice and it will take you far.
