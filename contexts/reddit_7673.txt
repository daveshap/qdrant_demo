Tips for submitting an abstract for a poster presentation at a conference?
Hey there, first time poster, apologies if this isn’t in the right place. 

I am in my second year of grad school (going for my MPH) and currently working full time. I am very interested in women’s health, and one of my colleagues also shares that passion. We found out that there’s a nearby conference later this year about women’s health, and that they’re accepting abstracts for a poster presentation. We decided we might try submitting something together about how our work in education empowers women and girls, and how that improves health equity in our county.

The only issue is that I haven’t submitted an abstract to a conference before. Ive looked at a couple of resources online, but I guess I’m feeling a little nervous about writing something that’s competitive/succinct enough to be accepted. 

Those who have submitted abstracts before, do you have any tips that you could share? What types of information did you include to make your abstract stand out from other submissions?
