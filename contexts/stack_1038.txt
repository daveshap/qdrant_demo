How to quickly minimize all windows for a single application? I know how to minimize/hide all windows in Cosmic Cuttlefish/GNOME Shell using SUPER+D, but I would like to be able to quickly minimize only all windows for a single application (say the one that currently has cursor focus). For example, I would like to minimize all LibreOffice documents, or all Terminal windows.I am not quite seeing or recognizing a way to do this in Settings > Devices > Keyboard. Is this possible?
