NORA: I wish they'd stop that. It makes me fidgety. Do you think they'll find him, Nick? He must be in New York.... Where do you think you're going?
NICK: I'm going to take Asta for a walk.
NORA: He's just been for a walk.
NICK: We're going sightseeing -- aren't we, Asta?
NORA: What's that? What are you up to? Nickie - what is this?
NICK: Looks like a hold-up!
NORA: What are you going to do?
NICK: I've got hunch. I'm going down to look at Wynant's shop, I want to find out why it's closed.
NORA: Why shouldn't be close it? He went away.
NICK: He went away lots of times when I knew him - but he never closed his shop. I've got a hunch something is up.
NORA: You mean, he might be hiding there?
NICK: I don't know... This thing has got my goat. I've got to find out.
NORA: Nick - I won't have you going down there.
NICK: Say you're the one who got me in this!
NORA: I know but this is different. He's a crazy man. He might kill you.
NICK: I'll be all right. I've got Asta to protect me.
NORA: Go on - go on - see if I care. But it's a dirty trick bringing me all the way to New York just to make me a widow.
NICK: You wouldn't be a widow long.
NORA: You bet I wouldn't.
NICK: Not with all your money!
NORA: You dog!
NICK: Goodbye, darling.
NORA: Nickie, take care of yourself won't you?
NICK: Sure I will.
NORA: Don't say it that way. Say it as if you meant it.
NICK: Why, I believe the little woman cares.
NORA: I don't care - I'm just used to you, that's all -- If you let anything happen to him, you'll never wag that tail again!
