I'm that guy in the group of friends
The one who gets dissed and made fun of consistently. It's clear I'm not respected as much as the others. It bugs me a good amount and makes me feel like I'm not on the same level as the rest of them. 

The most obvious answer is to get a new group of friends, which I have done and have started to hang out with more and more. However, the group I live with currently is the same group that makes me feel shitty. I can't move out for another year and half due to signing my name on a contract. 

It really pisses me off that they continue to look down on me.
