HARTMAN: The Governor gave me his word of honor he wouldn't interfere. Two days ago!
MAYOR: And you fell for it, Pete. It frightens me what I'd like to do to you. Who else knows about this?
PINKUS: They were all standing around when he wrote it. It was after they got back from fishing.
MAYOR: Get the Governor on the phone!
PINKUS: You can't get him on the phone. He's out duckshooting now.
MAYOR: Fishing! Duckshooting! How do you like that. A guy does nothing more strenuous for forty years than play pinochle -- he gets elected Governor and right away he thinks he's Tarzan!
HARTMAN: Read it! Insane, he says. He knows very well that Williams ain't insane!
PINKUS: Yeah. But I --
MAYOR: Pure politics!
HARTMAN: An attempt to ruin us!
MAYOR: Dementia praecox Oh-h-h!
HARTMAN: We got to think fast before those lying reporters get hold of this. What'll we tell 'em?
MAYOR: Tell 'em the party is through in this State on account of you.
HARTMAN: Ah, Fred -- Hello... this is Hartman --
MAYOR: And you can tell 'em as an afterthought that I want your resignation now!
HARTMAN: Sssh. Wait, Fred. What?... Where?... Where? Holy Moses!
MAYOR: What is it?
HARTMAN: They got him! Wait a minute -- hold the wire. They got Earl Williams surrounded -- the Riot Squad has -- in his house.
MAYOR: Tell 'em to hold the wire.
HARTMAN: I did. Hold the wire.
MAYOR: Cover up that transmitter!
MAYOR: Now, listen! You never arrived here with this -- reprieve. Get it?
PINKUS: Yes, I did, just now. Don't you remember?
MAYOR: How much do you make a week?
PINKUS: Huh?
MAYOR: How much do you make a week? What's your salary?
PINKUS: Forty dollars.
HARTMAN: No -- don't out me off.
MAYOR: How would you like to have a job for three hundred and fifty dollars a month. That's almost a hundred dollars a week!
PINKUS: Who? Me?
MAYOR: Who do you think!
MAYOR: Now, listen. There's a fine opening for a fellow like you in the City Sealer's office.
PINKUS: The what?
MAYOR: The City Sealer's office!
PINKUS: You mean here in the city?
MAYOR: Yes, yes!
HARTMAN: Well, wait a minute, will you? I'm in conference.
PINKUS: No, I couldn't do that.
MAYOR: Why not?
PINKUS: I couldn't work in the city. You see, I've got my family in the country.
MAYOR: But you could bring 'em in here! We'll pay all your expenses.
PINKUS: No, I don't think so.
MAYOR: For heaven's sake, why not?
PINKUS: I got two kids going to school there, and if I changed them from one town to another, they'd lose a grade.
MAYOR: No, they wouldn't -- they'd gain one! And I guarantee that they'll graduate with highest honors!
PINKUS: Yeah?
HARTMAN: Hold your horses -- will you, Olsen? Hurry up, Fred!
MAYOR: Now what do you say?
PINKUS: This puts me in a peculiar hole.
MAYOR: No, it doesn't. Now, remember: you never delivered this. You got caught in the traffic, or something. Now, get out of here and don't let anybody see you.
PINKUS: But how do I know...?
MAYOR: Come in and see me in my office tomorrow. What's your name?
PINKUS: Pinkus.
MAYOR: All right, Mr. Pinkus, all you've got to do is lay low and keep your mouth shut. Here! Go to this address. It's a nice, homey little place, and they'll take care of you for the night. Just tell 'em Fred sent you. And here's fifty dollars on account.
