KELLY: Will you calm down. Duquette's gonna come to you just like he did to me. You're gonna have to be ready for him.
SUZIE: Yeah, but he can't push you around like he can me. You've got family and they've got clout. With we it's different... with me...
KELLY: Yeah, I've got family and they've got clout and now you have me. Right? And Sam. Believe me, Suzie, this dickhead's not going to send you anywhere. He's gonna try and rattle your cage, and that's it. Stay strong and he can't do shit.
SUZIE: Man, I wanna smoke a joint.
