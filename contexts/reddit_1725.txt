Rejected from Harvard, accepted into the rap game.
Hey guys! It’s Ethan Kim here. I don’t know if anyone is still interested in my story but I thought I’d be the millionth person to tell you that everything happens for a reason. It’s been a couple months since I last posted here and as you already know, I was rejected from Harvard. 

But flash forward to today and so many amazing things have happened that I would have never imagined. I’m going to a great school and have been awarded multiple scholarships (one scholarship actually said I was chosen because of how compelling my story dealing with rejection was). On top of that, the rapper Rich Brian found my page and I have some big things planned! 

I have a younger brother still in high school and he’s starting to feel the pressure about applying to college. I hope him and everyone applying can take my story as an example of what happens when you be yourself. And equally important—that getting into the big name colleges aren’t everything! 

Oh and here’s the link to my second music video if anyone is interested! https://youtu.be/kOiTyoU7ebA
