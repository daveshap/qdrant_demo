EDWARD: Getting the yard all fixed up for your party, Amy. You'd better hurry and get yourself fixed up too.
AMY: Mommy's taking me upstairs to change my dress right away.
EDWARD: Everything all right down there at the school, Mr. Reed?
OLIVER: Yes, everything's all right, Edward.
EDWARD: When I first heard all that talk about you going down to the school to see the teacher I got really afeard. I thought maybe you night call off this birthday party -- and me with the cake already in the oven.
OLIVER: I imagine a child would have to commit murder or rob the Seventh National Bank of Tarrytown to be deprived of a birthday party.
OLIVER: I thought we were going to save those leaves you were burning for the compost bin.
EDWARD: Got more leaf mold now than we'll ever need, Mr. Reed. I thought I'd burn 'em up and get the yard clean.
AMY: Is that my birthday cake? May I see?
OLIVER: You'll see it when it's all lit and ready for you.
EDWARD: You won't have long to wait. In just a few minutes this house will be overflowing with boys and girls. Off with you now, Amy. Go out and watch from the gate for all the children who'll be coming.
OLIVER: Go on -- out with you.
