Book with blue six fingered aliens, Earth is xenophobic So I read this book in 2004. It started with a female character who had six fingers and she wears gloves that hide that. Earth is xenophobic so she has to hide that she is part alien. She plays some kind of dangerous sport where people die all the time and where there is no gravity in a large arena. Later she meets others that are part alien also and they steal a space ship to find the planet that their fathers had come from. Pretty sure that the race of aliens they were looking for was blue skin with six fingers and maybe the race name started with a J?Another thing I remember is that woman and the other hybrids are the children of women that were stolen from their planets by pirates and made to be slaves. I also think that the blue race of aliens is a warrior race? With technology that is more advanced than human technology. That's about all I remember I read this like 15 years ago.
