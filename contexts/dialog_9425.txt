BEER GUY: I have a CB in my truck, we could get some help out here.
BARTENDER: Who the hell would you call?
BEER GUY: Anyone.
BOZO: Do you drive a short beer bus or something? You go out there you get eaten, you stay in here you get eaten, anyone comes to help they get eaten. Don't you see a pattern here, Spuds Makenzie?
BEER GUY: Well then I guess we should just give up.
BOZO: Believe me, I'd love to save the day and get some heroic snatch. But it's not in the cards, partner.
BARTENDER: I think I know where a CB is.
BOZO: Where's that?
BARTENDER: Upstairs.
