WYDELL: And...
CAPT. SPAULDING: And I gave 'em directions out there, up by the old farm row... I figured what's the harm. Stupid kids probably going out to piss up a rope and got themselves turned around backasswards and got lost as shit.
WYDELL: Is that all... think real hard.
CAPT. SPAULDING: Yeah, they weren't here but a few minutes, didn't really have time to get as up close and personal as I do with most of the assholes that wander through here.
WYDELL: How's about you give me those same directions.
CAPT. SPAULDING: Yeah, yeah, sure. You don't have to get all True Grit all over my ass... I'll give'm to ya... you can knock yourself silly for all I care.
WYDELL: Enough talk, write.
