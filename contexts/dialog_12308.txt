VERONICA: What were <u>you</u> trying to do? Sleep?
HEATHER MCNAMARA: Suicide is a private thing.
VERONICA: You're giving your life away to become a goddamn statistic in U.S. Fucking A Today. That's got to be the least private thing I can think of.
HEATHER MCNAMARA: But what about Heather and Ram and Kurt?
VERONICA: If everyone jumped off a bridge, young lady, would you?
HEATHER MCNAMARA: Probably....
VERONICA: Hey now, if you were happy every day of your life, you wouldn't be a human being, you'd be a game show host.
HEATHER MCNAMARA: Let's knock off early. Go to the mall. Something lame like that.
VERONICA: Sure.
