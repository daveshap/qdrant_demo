KYLE: It's only a matter of time before my mom has HIM burned too!
STAN: What has the world come to? This is horrible. We're locked up, burning books, hating other people-
CARTMAN: -no Cheesy Poofs.
STAN: -No Cheesy Poofs... What the hell is happening?
KYLE: I don't know. But it has gone far enough! I'm sick of it! <b>Something must be done! Change has got to come around! They're taking all our laughter and burning it to the ground! Can't you see what this is leading to? A world of chains and ties and glue! We have to fight before they've taken every one! Something must be done!</b>
STAN: I agree! The only way to save our future is to unite and fight! <b>Something must be done! We must take action fast! My parents have gotten so strict they forgot they were children in the past!</b>
CARTMAN: <b>And my mom has become so bu-sy that she's raising heck and ignoring me I agree that there is now a battle to be won! Something must be done!</b>
STAN: But what are we going to do against this entire army?
