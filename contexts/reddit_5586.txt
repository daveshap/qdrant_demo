Recent grad in Sociology and completely lost
Hi, I recently graduated with a Bachelors in Sociology and have no idea what job opportunities I have with it. For the past 1.5 years I was certain I wanted to go into law enforcement but I broke my leg on the second day and can't go back. I feel like the rug was pulled out from under me and I have no idea what to do now. I'm feeling really hopeless and depressed and could use any kind of help/advice because I'm really, really lost.

Edit to add: I don't know why its showing up as Finance and Business and don't know how to get rid of it
