Cannot create SP in Azure SQL Database I am trying to create a stored procedure on my Azure SQL Database, which has joins to other database table in Azure SQL Database.I am getting the following error while creating the Stored Procedure:<blockquote>  Msg 40515, Level 15, State 1, Procedure sp_select, Line 16 [Batch Start  Line 0] Reference to database and/or server name in 'database.dbo.table'  is not supported in this version of SQL Server.</blockquote>I understand we can make cross database queries through Elastic Database Query, but how to create the stored procedure for it?
