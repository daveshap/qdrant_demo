I'm 25 and lost for choice of career, can anyone help?
Im 25 years old, and I can't make my mind up about which career to follow.

Things started to go well, studied literature,art and cinema in high school, and got into art school. I wanted to be an artist ever since I can remember, but sadly the school I got into specialized in conceptual art while I planned to go into illustration. I made the most of it, but only half the students got through to second year and I didn't make the cut. 

They told me I should try another art school but I didn't get into one, so I studied English Literature for a couple of years, then my student loans got cut so I had to look for a job. It took a year of trials doing any job that would take me until I got an apprentiship as a salesman at a makeup and perfume shop. The apprentiship went well, and I took a second apprentiship as assistant manager straight afterwards. I thought it was a great opportunity to learn valuable skills.
When I left, I thought about becoming an accountant, but after some research I realised it wasn't for me.

Recently I got some experience working for a woman who designs bags and accessories, It went great, she said I had a lot of potential, and I'm currently applying for a course in upcycling clothes. But since the quarantine put everything on pause I'm starting to have doubts again.

I don't know what's wrong with me. I can draw, paint, farm, apply makeup, sell a brand or product, manage a shop, write, analyse, research, sew. I want to do it all but I can't commit to one. If anyone's got any advice I'd really appreciate it, because right now I feel lost.
