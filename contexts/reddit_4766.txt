I can’t take this anymore
I can’t take this suffering anymore. Everyday feels meaningless and miserable. I don’t remember who I am, the past few months it feels like I’ve completely lost myself. I look at photos of me and don’t even feel like it was me. I don’t feel connected to anyone anymore, including myself. My mind says awful things everyday, and it’s like I can’t get it to stop. I can’t think normally anymore. I don’t laugh or smile like.. EVER anymore. I don’t find things funny. I’m sad and lonely. I feel like there’s no hope in me getting better. Another thing I’d lik to add is that with all of this I feel like I’ve lost my imagination. I can remember vivid images of things I’ve seen, but coming up with something myself feels impossible. It hasn’t been like this before, I’ve always been creative and had a great imagination, but now it just feels gone. I feel so hopeless and useless. I don’t know what to do. I feel like I’m slowly giving up, I cry everyday about how I’m feeling and the traumas that have happened to me. i can’t stop thinking about how things could’ve been different if I got help and told someone how was feeling when this all initially started. I need help but I don’t know what to do. I just want to go back in time and do things differently. I feel weak. I feel like smiling or being happy makes/made me weak. Loving anyone or anything made me weak. I don’t want to think like that though! When I was in love that was the happiest I’ve ever been. So that doesn’t make me weak.. right?
