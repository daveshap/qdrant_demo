Agency just reposted the job I applied to weeks ago and had an interview with yesterday...should I be worried Iâ€™m not getting it?
I applied for this job back at the end of December through a staffing agency. Meet with the recruiter and signed all the forms. She said sheâ€™d forward my resume and the company should get back to her after the holidays. I checked back on Indeed and the job posting I applied to had been removed/expired so I took that as a good sign.

Sure enough after New Years the recruiter called me saying the company wanted to interview me. Yesterday I went to the workplace met the manager, he showed me the workspace and had an interview. I thought it went pretty well. Recruiter even called me after and asked how I thought it went. I asked when she thought theyâ€™d make a decision she said a few days. 

I was really feeling good about this job but the agency just posted the same exact position on Indeed literally a day after my interview. Now Iâ€™m worried this is a sign Iâ€™m not going to get the job and theyâ€™re already started looking for someone else ðŸ˜°. 

What do you think?
