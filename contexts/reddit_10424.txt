I told my mom I'm suicidal, she forgot.
A few weeks ago I was doing a few chores with her when I broke down and told her that I hated life and that all I ever did when I woke is wishing something would kill that day because I'm not brave enough to do it myself, she called me ungrateful and I snapped and slapped her (It was wrong and I did apologize after it) she cried and that's where it ended. Today I broke down again and told her I needed help, she told me that I can talk to her whenever I want to Wich I answered "Don't you remember what happened the last time we talked?" She said that she did remember, that she remember how I slapped her, when I asked her if she remembers why I did and what we were talking about a that moment she just shrugged her shoulders and asked "What were we talking about"

I'm crushed and seriously in danger of trying to commit suicide again, if my mom doesn't even remember that her own son wants to kill himself then she obviously doesn't care enough and if she doesn't, who does? I'm just a waste anyways.
