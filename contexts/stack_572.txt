Low Latency Kernel Downsides? I'm considering moving from stock Ubuntu to Ubuntu Studio.My only concern is the low latency kernel. I've looked into what exactly it is, and know it will be great for my audio work, but I am wondering if it has any downsides?Does it cause compatibility issues?Does it reduce the lifespan of my hardware?Basically I am aware of the pros of the low latency kernel, I just want to know what the cons are so I can make an informed decision.Thanks in advance :)
