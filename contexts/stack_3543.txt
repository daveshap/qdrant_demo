Need to infect a computer for testing - how do? I'm trying to infect a laptop with malware for testing purposes and I just can't seem to do it. I've been searching for .exes that will just RUN and I can't find anything straight forward. Looking at this site all I can find are raw binaries but nothing really packaged and ready to go--unless I'm not looking in the right place.It seems that a lot of malware research sites are geared towards software development and the actual investigation of the code itself but I just need an .exe that will work.I never thought it would be this hard to deliberately infect a computer. Can someone please give me a link to a malware .exe or give me some tips on how to do this?
