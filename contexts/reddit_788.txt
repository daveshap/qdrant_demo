Family problems
Some times I just want to blow up at my family. For some reason they forget every time that the walls in this house are so thin. Or they just have no clue that I can hear them when they want to talk be hide my back. And I’m down with it I really am, I’ve been feeling like they’ve been pushing me away because maybe they given up on me... I was laying in my room getting ready to sleep. when I over hear my mom, dad and my brother start talking about how he was a higher GPA then me. The only reason why he has it higher then my is because he takes classes that are sooo easy that a third grade could do them. “Because he’s special” they say. We when to the doctors he doesn’t have Autism. He above the scale but my parents treat my brother so much like a kid so he acts like one. He will act like a little kid in a teenage body, yet he smart enough to beat R rated games. I guess I don’t get why they Compare him to me. I take classes that are college credit classes, he takes little kid classes. I just don’t see how that is a fair comparison. I work really hard every day even after school to dinner time some nights. While he comes home and plays video games beats them in a week and want to play a new one. Having no homework, no care, no stress, no nothing because everyone else takes care of him... and yet I’m not good enough for my parents to be proud of me like they are with him.

Maybe some could explain this for me it would help a lot.
