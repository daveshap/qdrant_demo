How Student Debt Affects my Life
I am over 40 years old and still owe $106,000 in student loans. The most significant way that debt impacted my life is that I chose to wait to have children until my finances were under control - that was a mistake because now I can't get pregnant. 

Here is a brief history of my student loans. After taking about a decade to finish my bachelors, 3 years to finish law school, an entire year to pass the bar (I failed the first time) and about 4 - 5 years building my solo practice (which is still not entirely stable) I found myself with $270,000 of federal loan debt.

My original strategy was to use IBR and deal with the tax consequences later, however because I got married and felt it was unfair to my spouse to burden our household for the next 20 years with my financial mistake, I refinanced to obtain a lower interest rate and started paying off the debt. Because my resume sucks, my best financial option was and is to focus on building my practice and earn more money, which meant that when my husband had to relocate 700 miles away for his job, I couldn't move with him - so now we live apart. Indefinitely. And my body doesn't feel like growing another human being and even if I could get pregnant I still owe $106,000 in student loan debt and my partner still lives 700 hundred miles away. And so the world goes on ... 

The moral of the story is that debt repayment is not worth sacrificing the the important sh\*t in your life. I should have learned to live with the debt and learn to live my life.
