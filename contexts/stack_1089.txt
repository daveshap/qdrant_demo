Gparted will not allow me to unmount partitions I am having a problem in Gparted. I am running Ubuntu 16.04. I need to expand my main partition, containg \"/\into unallocated space. I have used a live DVD with 18.04 to try to use Gparted to expand the partition. I believe that I have unmounted the partition because the \"lock\" symbol disappeared and I swich linuxswap partion to Off.Despite my best efforts the partition is not changeable in size. It's shown as Full in Gparted and I am wondering if this condition is somehow inhibiting my desired expansion of the partition.Can anyone suggest what I am failing to do correctly?
