FINCK: I don't remember his name. You must understand it was quite crowded, and when you are called in circumstances like that to look at the wound of the President who is dead, you don't look around too much to ask people for their names and who they are.
JIM: But you were a qualified pathologist. Was this Army general a qualified pathologist?
FINCK: No.
JIM: But you took his orders. He was directing the autopsy.
FINCK: No, because there were others. There were admirals.
JIM: There were admirals.
FINCK: Oh yes, there were admirals - and when you are a lieutenant colonel in the Army you just follow orders, and at the end of the autopsy we were specifically told - as I recall it was Admiral Kenney, the Surgeon General of the Navy - we were specifically told not to discuss the case.
