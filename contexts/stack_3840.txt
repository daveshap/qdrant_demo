If A is distributed uniformly on [8,10] and B on [9,11], what is the probability that B<A? I was asked this question in an interview, and did not initially answer correctly though I still think my interpretation may have been the correct one. The question was:<blockquote>  There are two delivery trucks, A and B. A makes deliveries between 8am and 10am, and B makes deliveries between 9am and 11am. The deliveries are uniformly distributed for both. What is the probability that any given delivery from B will take place before any delivery from A?</blockquote>What is your answer, and why?
