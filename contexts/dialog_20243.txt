FAITH: Because I know who Dwayne is, and he's reliable and stable and wants to marry me.
PETER: He's safe.
FAITH: So?! Is there something wrong with loving somebody who's safe?
PETER: Does he love you?
FAITH: He wants to marry me, doesn't he?
PETER: You didn't answer my question.
FAITH: Why are you asking me this?
PETER: Because I'd like to think at least one of you feels that way. Does he know who you are?
PETER: You stubbed your toe, don't you think that's a sign?
FAITH: What?
PETER: He's a podiatrist. Pain is your body's way of telling you something is wrong. Your toe is trying to tell you not to do it.
PETER: There must be something I can do, something I can say to make this up to you?... Just tell me what it is, I'll say it. I'll do it. I don't want you to hate me.
FAITH: Look, Peter, I don't hate you. But what we had was an illusion. Mutual wishful thinking. We both wanted to believe it for awhile, but it was all founded on a lie.
PETER: So?
FAITH: So it wasn't real.
PETER: What about the oasis in the desert? Are you telling me that was a lie?
FAITH: No, that wasn't a lie. That was... a mirage.
FAITH: Don't you see?.. We're not the ones who are meant to be. You're the man of somebody else's dreams.
PETER: Because I don't have the right name?!
