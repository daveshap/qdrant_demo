Visa ban/ British passport application I have been refused a UK visa because of a fake immigration stamp.The picture attached is the document I was given.However, I am a British citizen by descent but haven't made applications for my passport.. Is this an outright ban and can I still apply for a British passport or does this affect my British passport applications?
