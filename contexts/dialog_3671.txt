CHARLIE: Nick... You up?
NICK: No.
CHARLIE: Nick, have I been a good partner?
NICK: Number five with a bullet.
CHARLIE: I just want you to know... I mean anybody who says you ever took has got to deal with me.
NICK: Go to sleep, Charlie.
CHARLIE: You didn't take, did you...? You hear things.
NICK: I worked the three nine in Queens, Charlie.
CHARLIE: I didn't know.
NICK: The lieutenant was on the pad along with the rest of the squad. I was new, didn't know shit. When the feathers flew, I got called in front of the special prosecutor. It's on the top of my personnel file. They think I'm dirty or I cut a deal. Doesn't leave you with a lot of friends either way.
