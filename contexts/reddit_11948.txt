i am inherently inferior to others. i will never improve, this is determined by who i am. there is no reason to try so hard if my life will never genuinely improve.
i'm 21 and have failed at every corner of my life. lost my job, have no friends that i can see regularly. i moved away from my friends earlier this year, but even they were sick of my shit. i'm a failure when it comes to women. every single person in my old social group had more than 15 partners, and i have had zero. this indicates that i am inherently inferior to them, women sense that and avoid me at all costs. i can't figure out why, but i know for a fact that i am a repellant to women. i don't think that there's anything wrong with me in particular, but i suppose that i am just that kind of person who is constructed in a way that sends messages down to women's brains that says i am just one to be avoided at all costs.

i go to community college for the time being. it fucking sucks. nothing to do but go to class, go home, be alone at home and study.

i can get my degree, land a good job, work. do the things i enjoy alone during my free time, but it will always be shit because i WILL be alone. i know this for a fact because, again, i have never had sex and every other person in my social group has had more than a dozen, easily. the only explanation for this is that i am just, by some quality of my being, sending signals to women's brains that says AVOID HIM AT ALL COSTS.

life is fucking garbage. i am girl kryptonite. it's not my fucking appearance/hygiene/confidence/social skills/lack of hobbies. if you saw my picture you would shower me with comments about how cute i am, if you saw me in real life you wouldn't even talk to me. that's the truth, and i will never know why because nothing awaits me in life but shit and loneliness.
