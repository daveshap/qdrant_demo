Is Graduate school free?
My roommate is going to UWM for graduate school. He said the school is paying for his tuition, in addition, to a $13,500 stipend. Plus, he is getting free insurance through the school as well. All from a part-time teaching assistant position that he will work simultaneously with his grad program work.

I never thought to go to graduate school because of all the expenses, but is it really that easy? It's making me reconsider my options, if it's free to go.

For reference: My roommate got into graduate school with a 3.0gpa and average entrance exam scores.
