MARGIE: Did you tell them? That we were coming?
WADE: Don't you think it's proper for a fella to introduce his girl to his parents?
MARGIE: I know your parents.
WADE: I just want to pick up my divorce papers. For the lawyer. It won't take long.
MARGIE: Are you sure they're home? Did you call?
WADE: The truck's here. Looks like they've stayed inside since the snow started.
WADE: Strange.
MARGIE: Think they're alright?
WADE: Of course! I would've heard.
MARGIE: How?
WADE: I don't know for Christ's sake!
