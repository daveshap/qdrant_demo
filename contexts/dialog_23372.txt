MARY: Yes —— yes, if she made that much impression on you, I'm sure it was Jacqueline.
MRS. ROMARI: She's not been here for a long time.
MARY: But she was here?
MRS. ROMARI: Oh yes, yes. One day a beautiful car comes here. This beautiful lady in furs gets out. There is a handsome man with her, and the chauffeur The lady rents one of our upstairs rooms. The chauffeur changes the lock on the door. Then the lady never comes back --not to live, anyhow. She came back three, four times, but always alone and just to eat.
MARY: You mean she just came here, rented the room, locked it, and left?
MRS. ROMARI: Yes -- and pays the rent every month.
MARY: Could you let me see that room? If it is hers, there might be something there to help me find my sister.
ROMARI: No -- the rent in paid. The lady asked us to promise, I wouldn't open the door.
MARY: Please.
