How can I turn a social media platform into job experience?
So this is a painfully Gen Z question. 

I'm a fashion business student and I recently gained over 100K followers on Tiktok by making videos of me talking about random subjects, making jokes, etc. (nothing vulgar and no dancing or anything). I feel like this platform could be a great addition to my resume if I only knew what to do with it. Does anyone have any ideas for how to turn this into job experience that may be relevant in my field (ex. selling merch, doing brand deals, etc.) and how would you word those types of things on a resume? 

My deepest condolences for contributing to the death of humanity.
