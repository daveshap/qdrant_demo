CREIGHTON: ...You bring a check?
ED: Cash.
CREIGHTON: Cash?!
CREIGHTON: ...Usually we do this kind of thing with a bank draft. But cash--that's fine--it's all the same in the end-- dough's dough, huh?
ED: Sure.
CREIGHTON: I got the paperwork here. Partnership papers here, they reflect our agreement: fifty-fifty on the net, I supply professional services, you supply the capital. I'll give you a receipt on the dough there, huh?
ED: Yeah.
CREIGHTON: Pretty straightforward, but I don't know if you wanna show this stuff to a lawyer--
ED: It's OK.

CREIGHTON: ...Just a second here, I'll give you a receipt on the, uh... Whoa, Nellie... Oh, by the way, we didn't talk about this, I, uh, I think I'm gonna call the place Tolliver's, after me, you know, I didn't think you were much interested in, uh--

CREIGHTON: Yeah, good. Lemme just, uh...
CREIGHTON: ...Yeah, that's it. As per our discussion.

CREIGHTON: *Screw* you--Jesus! Take it to a lawyer! No, I insist! This is *dry* cleaning, this is not some fly-by- night thing here! I must say, I've been an entrepreneur for thirteen years and I've never--
ED: All right.
CREIGHTON: And I've never been asked--Look, you want the dough back? You know who I am! You--
ED: OK.
