SKINNY: Hit your finger, huh?
LITTLE BILL: Huh? Hullo, Skinny. Snuck up on me. How do you like her?
SKINNY: Heard you done the roof yourself.
LITTLE BILL: Roof? Jesus, Skinny, I done practically every damn thing myself. Roberts boy hauled wood, that's all.
SKINNY: What's all that wood?
LITTLE BILL: Porch. I'm puttin' a porch on her so's I can puff my pipe of an evening an' drink my coffee an' watch the sun set.
