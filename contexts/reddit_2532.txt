How can I navigate my education in a society that deems so many degrees to be worthless?
I’m trying to find what path to go in college and of course everything Im passionate about “doesn’t get you a job.” Im unsure on what I should pursue. I am passionate in many areas. I really have wanted to go into psychology these past few years and I think I would do well in a psych career. I just really love research it’s just the issue with that is, it seems like a very soulless cut throat environment. My other passions are advocacy and politics. Another subject I love is sociology I really enjoyed learning about how things work together. If anyone knows which one of these would be best to pursue as a major and has any examples of paths I could take towards decent paying jobs please let me know. I want to learn about things other than psych I’ve already researched all of those for the most part. I just want to help and empower people ultimately whether large or small scale.
