PETER: Sorry. I thought it was empty.
KATHY: It's alright.
KATHY: Is this your first time here?
PETER: Yes.
KATHY: I love this hotel. I stay here every time I visit my parents.
PETER: How come you don't stay with them?
KATHY: Because I love them, but they drive me crazy. You know how parents are?
PETER: No. I don't.
KATHY: Are you with the tournament?
PETER: Uh huh.
KATHY: Are you one of the players?
PETER: Yes.
KATHY: I've always wanted to learn how to play chess. I don't have the patience for it. When did you start playing?
PETER: When I was very young.
KATHY: It seems like such a complicated game.
PETER: Not really. You see your goal and you go after it. Anything that gets in the way is an obstacle and must be destroyed.
KATHY: Sounds very violent.
PETER: Chess is a reflection of life. Life is violent. The strong win. The weak perish.
KATHY: --but you enjoy being the stronger one? You like the control.
PETER: If you're asking me if I'm passionate about what I do, the answer is yes. Without passion, nothing moves us. What's your passion?
KATHY: That's a very personal question.
PETER: I see. This is going to be a very polite conversation. What shall we discuss? The weather? Movies?
KATHY: Are you disappointed that I won't answer you?
PETER: I had just hoped there would be more substance to the conversation.
KATHY: I thought opening too quickly was a fatal mistake in chess.
PETER: It is.
KATHY: Do you always open quickly?
PETER: Are we talking about me, or chess?
KATHY: You.
PETER: Each circumstance requires a different tactic.
KATHY: Well, I hope you remember that tomorrow when you play Krikorian.
KATHY: Well, I think I've had enough.
PETER: Getting too hot in here for you?
PETER: What are you looking for?
KATHY: Nothing. I just came in for a steam.
PETER: No you didn't.
