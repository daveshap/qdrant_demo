Tobit model with flexible censoring point in R I am currently writing my MSc thesis and I am using a Tobit model.My data consists of fleet and sales data. The censored dependent variable is quantity and this quantity is higher than the fleet number. However, this fleet number differs for every line. I found that I could use the crch package in R and use the fleet numbers as a right censoring point. Or I think I can use that.But I am wondering, is there also another option to estimate the regression with a changing number as censoring point?Thanks in advance!
