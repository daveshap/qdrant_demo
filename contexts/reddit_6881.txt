My job layed off everyone only to hire us in a different temporary position!
I’ve only worked at my position since January. I really liked the role (marketing/sales), but the management was always shady to me.

Today we had an emergency meeting where the director of our department announced that all but 10% of our department would lose our jobs and be re-trained in a data entry. While I am thankful to have any job, I am just really confused. This temporary job could last 3 weeks to 7 months depending on consumer need, which then our boss would re-hire and retrain whoever she wanted of us.

There was no choice about this and the 10% was based on seniority/ our boss’ favorites.

Our salary/bonus structure was not really discussed for this new job. I have a day off for weekend getaway planned for Friday and I was told that weather I have that day off is to the discretion of my new boss, who I’ve never met before. 

I am really at a loss of what to do and what are my rights in this scenario? Is it time to jump ship and how do I spin this three months of marketing?
