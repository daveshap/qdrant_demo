CARTER: Let her go. She'll be OK. Sorry about that.
EDDIE: Don't worry. She's bound to be upset.
CARTER: Have another?
EDDIE: No. I'll be off now. I should be at work.
CARTER: Look, look. Get your suit cleaned.
EDDIE: No. It's all right.
CARTER: Thanks for coming.
EDDIE: Frank was a good bloke. It's the least I could have done.
CARTER: You work here, Keith?
KEITH: Yes.
CARTER: Keith, if anybody comes in here and asks for me, you let me know. Right?
KEITH: Right.
CARTER: I'm at the Las Vegas. Behind the dance hall. Do you know a man called Albert Swift?
KEITH: Yeah. He comes in here a bit.
CARTER: Where would I find him?
KEITH: Today? At the races. He always goes.
KEITH: How'd you know Albert?
CARTER: Went to school with him. He was leader of our gang. He'll know what's going on in this town.
