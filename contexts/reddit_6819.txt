I passed my phone interview and she wants to interview virtually tomorrow. Isn’t this kind of too soon?
I told her I’m no longer with my older company. 
I don’t want to start until sept 16.

I feel like I’m gonna get the job. I’m quite nervous. If this is a virtual interview shouldn’t there be a real in person interview atleast a meet and greet? 

So if she asks when I want to start do I say September 16? 
Anyone give me advice for virtual interviews
