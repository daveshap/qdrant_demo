HAL: Viktor, I'm so happy for us!
VIKTOR: Hello, Hal.
HAL: The film. The chemistry. No reflections on Nicola but Simone and I -- we were just so right together.
VIKTOR: You never were together, Hal.
HAL: And still the connection was undeniable. I haven't read Eternity Forever" but I know it's brilliant. And I know I would be perfect for Clive."
VIKTOR: Clyde.
HAL: Yes, perfect. As a matter of fact, I ran into Simone on the lot the other day.
VIKTOR: Really? She didn't mention it.
HAL: I'm sure she's meeting with a lot of people right now. She is just as you described her, Viktor... indescribable. I strongly sensed she thought I was right for it.
