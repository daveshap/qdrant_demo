Do any of you have a mentor who "coaches" you with big career decisions? If so, how did you go about establishing/nurturing this kind of relationship? How often do you get together? How would you measure the impact they've made on you personally/professionally?
I know parents are the go-to for most of life lessons, but with careers I'm curious how many people are involved in more of a professional mentoring relationship?
