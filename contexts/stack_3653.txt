Should I use TOTP when using OAuth2 I'm implementing TOTP in my application to allow users to use two factor authentication with Google authenticator and the like.However I've also implemented \"social login\" using OAuth, should the users be prompted for their TOTP codes when logging in with those OAuth accounts as well? (Given that users might already be using 2FA on that service the login experience could become cumbersome)
