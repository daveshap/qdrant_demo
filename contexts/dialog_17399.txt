JOHN: Can't. I'm feeling too good.
ANN: Oh, come on, now. This is serious. You're a man disgusted with all of civilization.
JOHN: With all of it?
ANN: Yes, you're sore at the world. Come on, now.
JOHN: Oh, crabby guy, huh?
ANN: Yeah. No, no! No! No, look. You don't have to smell the world!
JOHN: Well, all those guys in the bleachers think—
ANN: Never mind those guys. All right, stand up. Now let's see what you look like when you protest.
JOHN: Against what?
ANN: Against anything. Just protest.
JOHN: You got me.
ANN: Oh, look. I'm the umpire, and you just cut the heart of the plate with your fast one and I call it a ball. What would you do?
JOHN: Oh, yuh did, huh?
ANN: Yes!
JOHN: Why can't you call right, you bone- headed, pig-eared, lop-eared, pot- bellied—
ANN: Grab it, Eddie, grab it!
