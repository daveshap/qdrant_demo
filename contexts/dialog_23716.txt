ROLLO: Not exactly the kind of lunch Hobbes would have laid on you, Rog, but it's all I got, and... ...all I got I share with you. Go ahead. Take all you want.
ST. LUC: You touch my spleen, Rollo. And here all the time I was thinking -- if I ever bothered to think about the good old days -- well, at least there's Rollo. He's in VD and he's happy.
ROLLO: I'm still a VD man under the skin, Rog. You know me. I'm a down-to-earth kinda guy, right?
ST. LUC: Well, at least you still talk the same.
ROLLO: So who changes?
ST. LUC: But you gave up your private practice. Suddenly you're into pure research and you... you're what, a parasitologist?
ROLLO: That was my father's idea... private practice. He wanted to set me up -- I couldn't say no. But he's dead now. And me, I'm still a snoop, I gotta do research. Look at that beautiful stuff... ...lookit it!
