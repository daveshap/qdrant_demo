What should i do?
Hi i'm Miller! I'm 15 and i'm in highschool.
Last week i started to like one of my classmates(of course a girl),and i just tried to speak to her , we talked the whole weekend on YM about different stuff. On Sunday she told me that she really likes me,i said the same thing...On Monday when i got to school she was considering me her boyfriend(i was so fullfilled with that). Sometimes we were hugging and talking and stuff.But in the same exact day an asshole noticed our "relationship" and started to chat & flirt with her. I let him do his episode being sure that she won't give a fuck and that she would remain confident...but i guess i made a mistake letting him flirt with her. I realised she was not as nice as i thought after she speaked with that guy for the whole day! In that evening we chatted ,aswell on YM, and she was talking with him...I asked her "What kind of friends are we?" and she said "Very good friends." I understood,she rejected me...I couldn't sleep that night and the next day i was fucked up!
Now she doesn't even speak to me...
No happy end here...  :'(
Well there seems to be a happy end just because of the friends that take care of me.I have to thank you for reading my "novel" and now i tend to realise that this was not such a big loss...Thank you fellow redditers! =)
Happy end!
