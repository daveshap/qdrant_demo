Yesterday I was rejected in person for being too short
I met a girl from tinder after a week of mon stop chatting. She was fawning over me.

In person, her first words to me was you're shorter than I expected despite me telling her my height on text and she saying she was fine with it. She told me she couldn't do this and doesn't want to waste her time and easy. She then apologised, said she can't do it and left.

I'm so distraught. This pain hurts so much.
