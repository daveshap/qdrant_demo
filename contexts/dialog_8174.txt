L.T.: Well that's why I'm here, Mr. Dean. 'Cause you're a labor lawyer.
DEAN: Good point.
L.T.: Last night, Larry Spinks, he works the Steel Press, he goes to a bar with his wife Rosalie to have a glass of chianti 'cause it's his birthday, and these two guys, these Guido mother-fuckers, they jump him when he goes to the bathroom.
DEAN: L.T., in this office I'd prefer you say Italian-Americans.
L.T.: I'm sorry, Mr. Dean. But Larry's in St. Lukes now, so I'm a little--I'm not myself. The Union bosses say unless we take Bellmoth's offer, it'll only get worse.
DEAN: That's because your Union bosses <u>are</u> those Guido mother-fuckers.
L.T.: I don't under--
DEAN: The Union's trying to railroad you into accepting terms worse than what you have now.
L.T.: Why would the Union--
DEAN: Because they've been paid off by Bellmoth.
L.T.: Mr. Dean--
DEAN: My name's Bobby. I'm your lawyer. Don't do anything 'till I talk to you.
