Is it possible to become infected with virus, trojan or malware by browsing the infected sites or running installation .exe? I am quite paranoid and I am always afraid that when i accidentally open some infected sites it would run scripts that automatically download malwares, viruses and trojans into my pc and run by themselves without prompting the download window.   Do browsers report every download or is it possible to circumvent it in some way that initiates downloads? And is it possible to have malwares, trojans or viruses that could infect your pc without having you download something -- but instead through text-based or web-script based means of transmission? How safe are popular browsers such as google chrome, firefox etc.. and in comparison, very outdated ones such as windows IE. Does the type of internet protocol (http, https matter in this regard? Also for malwares and adwares, do they infect your computer with undesirable elements immediately when you run the installation .exe files, or does it require for them to finish installation? Generally is it possible to check what kind of changes a program makes beforehand or afterwards, and is it possible to block the changes it wants to make midway if you have found out its a malware or adware during installation or with the process running already. I think windows by default would notify you if a program wants to make changes to your pc but usually i disable that since the default behaviour of that windows function is too annoying...is there an alternative solution that could detect changes made to computer and halt them only when you request for it, or that the program is included in some kind of online blacklist?
