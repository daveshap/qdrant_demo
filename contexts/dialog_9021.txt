CASH: Look, I don’t know what you’re getting so worked up about, you did this...you brought this on yourself.
JACK: Brought what on myself?! I didn’t do anything!
CASH: No? C’mon, Jack...I’ve got everything I need, I don’t have regrets, that’s just not for me... sound familiar?
JACK: You mean because you thought I was cocky I’m now on a permanent acid trip?!!
CASH: Everyone else in that store is a statue, they see their lives passing in front of their eyes, but not you. You’re making a business deal...
JACK: Give me my goddamn life back!
CASH: You? What about me? I’m working hard for you here, Jack. On Christmas too! Now you did a good thing last night, intervening that way. I was moved...
JACK: Please. Just tell me what’s happening to me. In plain English. None of that mumbo jumbo...
CASH: It’s a glimpse, Jacko.
JACK: I glimpse? A glimpse of what!? What glimpse?! Glimpse!
CASH: Look, eventually, everybody gets one...some of ‘em take a couple seconds... ...some of ‘em take a lot longer...
JACK: I asked you a direct question! A glimpse of what?!
CASH: Figure it out. You got plenty of time.
JACK: How much time?!
CASH: As long as it takes to figure it out. Which, in your case, could be considerable.
JACK: Look, I just want my life back. Now what’s it gonna take? You wanna talk turkey? Let’s talk turkey! How much money...?
CASH: Do I look like I need your money. It doesn’t work like that and I can’t tell you why.
JACK: Why not?
CASH: Because you got to figure it out for yourself. Are you listening to me?
JACK: Figure it out? Figure what out?!
JACK: That’s it? That’s all I get?! A glare?!
CASH: Look Jack, in my experience the best way people deal with this is to just relax and breathe through it...let it come to you.
