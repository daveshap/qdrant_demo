Does anyone else feel like suicide is the way they're "meant to go"?
I don't think that's the right way to phrase it but I really don't care about anything right now. 

The way I feel right now, and have for the longest time, is not something I can deal with forever. I don't know when I'll die, this year, next year, whenever, but I'm almost 100% sure that it'll be by my own hand. It feels like it's inevitable.
