Opto switch for detecting translucent polypropylene I am building a liquid handler (a CNC machine that pipettes small quantities of liquids). The machine switches polypropylene \"tips\" between pipetting different fluids. Positional accuracy within 0.5mm of the pipette tips is key. However, I have sourced tips from several different manufactures and in each batch there are some tips that are slightly bent/warped. I would like to find the position of the bottom of the pipette tip to calculate any offset into the g-code if the pipette tip is bent. (Note: The diameter of the bottom of the pipette tip is 0.75mm.) These tips are very fragile, so I would prefer not to bump them into mechanical switches. I wanted to use optical switches, but polypropylene has a high transmission of IR wavelengths, and thus do not trigger optical switches. So my question: is there a way to optically detect polypropylene? Polypropylene has a low transmission at 3250 nm. This is my first post to StackExchange let me know if detail/formatting is lacking. Thank you for your time.
