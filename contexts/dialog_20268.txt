PETER: Is something the matter?
FAITH: GET OUT!!
PETER: I'd call that a yes. Do I get a hint?
FAITH: You want a hint? I'll give you a hint. You are the lowest, most despicable, most reprehensible form of reptilian swine--
PETER: There's no such thing.
FAITH: What?
PETER: Reptilian swine. There's no such thing. Reptiles aren't swine.
FAITH: Who cares?! You hired an actor??
PETER: I don't know what you're talking about. Who told you that?
FAITH: No one had to tell me. He's starring in the local play.
