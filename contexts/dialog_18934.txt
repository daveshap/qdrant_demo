VADA: Bye. She looks a little like me when I was a little girl.
JEFFREY: Does she?
JEFFREY: I'm glad you're here.
VADA: You are?
JEFFREY: Yeah, come on, let's talk.
VADA: We have this school assignment to write about someone we never met and I chose my mother. She was born in Los Angeles and since my uncle Phil moved out here I came in to visit him and then I looked at her high school yearbook and... and I called a few people and one guy said that she went to UCLA, another guy said that I should call Hillary Mitchell so....
JEFFREY: Hillary Mitchell? How's she?
VADA: Oh she's great...she's a little crazy though. Anyway, Hillary said that you had a black Ford truck and this policeman I know got in touch with Motor Vehicles and...he gave me your address and here I am.
JEFFREY: 
VADA: I told you it was a long story.
JEFFREY: That's all right, you know what? You sound just sounded just like your mother...she told great stories. Stories with crazy accents and...special effects.
VADA: Special effects?
JEFFREY: Yeah like, switching a lamp on and off when she was talking about lightning...audiences love stuff like that. And your mom knew how to work an audience.
VADA: I don't know very much about her...I was hoping that you could help me.
JEFFREY: I'll try.
