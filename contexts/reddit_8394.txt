What are the pros and cons of the two bills proposed today regarding protecting the Special Counsel?
[Two different bills were introduced today](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2017/08/03/senators-seek-protect-special-counsels-through-legislation/537405001/) by different bipartisan groups of Senators which would provide statutory protection against the termination of a special counsel, in particular aiming at protecting Robert Mueller.

The first, introduced by [Sens. Graham and Booker](https://www.scribd.com/document/355454481/Special-Counsel-Independence-Protection-Act) would require pre-emptive judicial review of any removal of a special counsel.

The second, introduced by [Sens. Tillis and Coons](https://www.tillis.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2017/8/tillis-coons-introduce-the-special-counsel-integrity-act) would allow a terminated special counsel to bring a court action to restore them to their position and would require expedited disposition of that court action.

Neither bill revives the prior [Office of the Independent Counsel,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Office_of_the_Independent_Counsel) but rather seek to work within the framework of the [current special counsel regulations.](https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/28/part-600)

What are the pros and cons of each of these bills?
