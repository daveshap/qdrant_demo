If your picture is more than one person, I'm going to assume you are the least attractive one.
I don't know why people do this. Honestly. I'm not trying to date your group of friends (well, I would but). I see so many people who just don't seem to get a dating profile pic. First of all, it should be YOU not you and three people, not a crowd shot. YOU. And it should be in focus. And lit. You should be, ya know, visible. And ANGLES! Don't be looking down at your phone all 32 chins or some weird shit. 

Sigh

Sorry.

I'm not a model or a photographer, but basics.

Light, focus, angle, face, you.

Effort.

Update: I'm getting replies that agree. But I also have replies that seem to think I'm too judgemental. I can only assume these are the people who can't be bothered to take a decent selfie for their profiles ðŸ˜‚
