TOBY: I asked you a question.
JENNY: Aw, Toby, we weren't doing nothing. We was just talking.
TOBY: You shut your mouth, girl, and get back over to our table. Now, I'm not going to ask you again, Mister. What were you doing with my girl?
JOHN: I wasn't doing anything.
TOBY: That's not the way it looked to me. Looked to me like you was trying to make time with her.
JOHN: Make time? Is everybody in this town slap happy?
JENNY: Honest, Toby. I just asked him for a quarter for the jukebox.
TOBY: Stay out of this, Jenny. We got man's business to take care of.
JOHN: Look, pal, I wasn't making a play for your girl.
TOBY: You expect me to believe that?
JOHN: I don't care what you believe as long as you leave me alone.
TOBY: Mister, I'm calling you out.
JOHN: What? You want to fight? Over her?
JOHN: You're fucked.
TOBY: You know who I am? Toby N. Tyler. My friends call me TNT. You know why?
JOHN: They're not very imaginative?
TOBY: 'Cause I'm just like dynamite. And when I go off somebody gets hurt.
JOHN: Fine. I was making time with your girl. Now I'm all scared, and I'll never make that mistake again. Now go away.
TOBY: Not before I settle with you.
JOHN: Christ, I don't believe this.
TOBY: Stand up.
JOHN: I wasn't hitting on your girl!
TOBY: Stand up, Mister, or I'll beat you where you sit.
