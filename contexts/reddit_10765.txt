Today, I've reached one of the lowest points in my life. I hope you finish reading my post.
Hello. Right now, there are a lot of words that have stopped really reaching me for a while now. 

I'm still here. I can't afford to be gone. I am the pillar of other people. 

That's why, right now, when I'm at my weakest, I have to ask strangers to be MY pillar. I'm not really expecting much. I'm just hoping that somewhere, there's someone who's reading my thoughts and letting me be my vulnerable self. Maybe after you've read this post, maybe you could take half a minute to wish me better luck. I'm not religious, but you can also wish me blessings. At this point, I'd take anything. But for just reading this, I'd like to say thank you.
