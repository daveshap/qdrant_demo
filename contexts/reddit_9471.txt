I’m a 26 year old law student feeling suffocated by debt and terrified of the future. I don’t know what to do, I’m stressed and scared and I really need some help.
I am shaking while writing this, but I know that I need to suck it up and put it all out there. I've been struggling financially for the past few months and I am feeling so suffocated under all of this that I can't see a way out. I have been more stressed and anxious about this than anything else in my life. I could barely sleep last night, my heart beating out of my chest, knowing that I was going to type this post up and submit it today, asking for help/advice/suggestions/a way forward.

I feel so overwhelmed I don't even know where to begin.

First, some info about me: I am a 26 year old law student, in the middle of my final year of school. I go to school full-time, am a senior editor on the law school's law review, and I also work two part-time jobs (one is at Starbucks, the other is a legal internship for the federal government that limits me on how many hours I can work). I do about 12-18 hours at starbucks and only 4 hours with the government per week. On top of that, I am doing lots of post-graduation job searching, networking, applying, interviewing and other things to try and help me find decent-paying legal work after I graduate. I have little to no time formyself and It is *killing me*. I am stretched thin, tired, losing weight, struggling to keep up in school and on top of all this, I've always got money and my debt and my insufficient income to help me out on my mind. 

I've tried reading some self-help financial books, but a lot of them seem to be geared more towards people who are already pretty financially stable, who need advice investing or saving for retirement, etc. I can't even begin to think about that right now. It scares me, freaks me out, makes my heart rate speed up. I am terrified that I've fucked over my future, because of stupid decisions and irresponsibility.

When I graduate in the spring, I will have roughly $150,000 in student loans. That thought terrifies me. Currently, I have $17,931.87 in credit card debt. In late spring earlier this year, I opened a balance transfer card to send some of my debt over there, in the hopes of avoiding paying more interest on it. As you will see, that didn't come to fruition, and I've ended up gathering more debt since then...

This has all accumulated on top of my student loans for a number of reasons: cost of living increased much more than I expected, unexpected car troubles/emergencies hit me that I was unprepared for, and during both of my summers in between years of school, I was working away from home, unable to sub-let my apartment, and without student loans in the summer to help buoy me, was paying to live in a different city for work while also having to maintain my apartment at home. I ended up being unable to save anything from either of these two summer jobs, had to rely on credit cards to just pay rent/utilities/travel expenses/etc., and now, here I am. Drowning in debt, suffocating, feeling like there is no end in sight. I'm not trying to make excuses, I know I'm in a deep hole and I need some help to get out of it. 


I am terrified. I am feeling so lost and helpless and ashamed. I'm depressed and suffering mild anxiety attacks, which has never happened before. I never thought this would happen to me but I don't know what to do or where to turn or what to even *start* doing now to fix anything. I hope I haven't ruined my life and my future. I need some help, please. 

To help out, I've tried to outline my accounts, and bills that I know I will for sure need to take care of in the coming months. I don't get another student loan deposit till January. I don't know what to do, or where to begin, or how to move forward. I feel stuck and like there's nothing I can do, but I am motivated to try something to improve my situation.
