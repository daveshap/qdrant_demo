Anyone else ever fantasise about their own death and funeral?
I sometimes find myself fantasising about my own death, like picturing how I'd die, whether it's from suicide or even some tragic accident. I imagine what my funeral would be like, all my friend's and family being upset and devastated about my death. I wonder who would actually be upset and how much they cared about me. It kinda makes me want to do it even more tbh, it makes me feel something that I can't really explain.

I just want to know if anyone else gets this?
