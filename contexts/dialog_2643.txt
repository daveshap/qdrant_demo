1/16TH BLACK: BLAK OUT. BLAK LISTED. BLAK BALL. Need I say more.
BIG BLACK: B-L-A-K it is.
ORCHID: You must think I'm some kind of fool.
DELACROIX: It looks delicious.
ORCHID: You hear me talkin' to you. The only time you come up here when something is wrong.
DELACROIX: C'mon, Mommy, don't start with that I'm an ungrateful son stuff.
ORCHID: I said no such thing. All I said is that something must be wrong.
ORCHID: How's the food?
DELACROIX: Can't beat it with a hammer. Well, since you asked, it looks like I may have a new show, a pilot being shot.
ORCHID: That's wonderful. Isn't that what you always wanted, a show of your own?
DELACROIX: It was. It is. But this is a different kind of show.
ORCHID: If at first it's not what you want, just work that much harder, Peerless.
DELACROIX: Mommy, please don't call me that.
ORCHID: Son, Peerless is your name. Now you might be one of these Hollywood types, change your name and all that but Peerless Dothan is on your birth certificate.
DELACROIX: I know what's on my birth certificate. You heard from Daddy?
ORCHID: I guess he's still on the road. What kind of show is this? Are they some Negroes in it without being buffoons?
DELACROIX: To answer your question, there are a lot of Negroes in it and what is your definition of buffoons?
ORCHID: Peerless, I didn't raise a buffoon. We have enough of those on television already.
DELACROIX: Please let me know when you hear from Daddy, get a number or something.
ORCHID: I will. And good luck with your show. I hope it's a huge success. You've worked very hard. You deserve it.
SLOAN: You okay?
DELACROIX: I feel like somebody hit me upside da head with a sledgehammer.
CHEEBA: DeLa - what's the matter with you.
MANTAN: You ain't happy about the green light?
SLOAN: People show their happiness in a lot of different ways.
MANTAN: Well, homeboy, looks like he's at a funeral.
DELACROIX: I'm happy for all of us. It's just we have a great responsibility now. The pressure is on.
MANTAN: Pressure? DeLa, you don't know what the hell real pressure is. SHEEETT!!! This is lightstuff. Now when you scramblin' out on the street in da January winter and the hawk is talkin' to you with NO money and NO prospects of money anytime soon, now that there is some pressure.
DELACROIX: I didn't mean it to sound like that.
MANTAN: That's the way it came out. Let me ask you one question. Have you ever been in want, in need your entire privileged life?
DELACROIX: Now I'm privileged?! Why? Because I didn't grow up on food stamps and welfare? Because I didn't call home a cardboard box? No, I never ever went to bed hungry and I'm proud of it, too. Whoever told you that living in poverty earns you somekind of badge of honor flat out lied to you.
MANTAN: The point I'm trying to make is that this is a blessing. It's going to be fun doing this show and we should all look at it that way.
CHEEBA: What's wrong with him?
MANTAN: Must be the pressure.
