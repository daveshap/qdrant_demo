SAMI: What are you doing?
AGENT HADLEY: You think I'm going to talk to you until I know if you're wired.
SAMI: Wired? I ain't wired.
AGENT HADLEY: Okay. Okay. I believe you.
SAMI: You killed her!
AGENT HADLEY: No. You killed her. Manager remembers you going into her room. Your fingerprints were found all over the place.
SAMI: Bullshit! She was alive when we left her with you.
AGENT HADLEY: You're fucked, Sami. You know it. That's why you're here.
SAMI: Look, I just want out of this nightmare. I don't know these guys. A few days ago I'm in Paris picking pockets and now I'm America's most wanted.
AGENT HADLEY: Where are the tapes?
SAMI: I can get them -- but what do I get if I do?
AGENT HADLEY: A pass.
SAMI: A pass? How you gonna give me a pass? A witness can put me at the crime scene.
AGENT HADLEY: Witness' can be convinced they made a mistake. Without the murder weapon the D.A. won't have enough to prosecute you.
SAMI: They don't have a murder weapon?
AGENT HADLEY: No. I have it. The lamp? The one with your fingerprints and her blood on it? Remember?
