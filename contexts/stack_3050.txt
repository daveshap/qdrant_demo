Why can't a particle penetrate an infinite potential barrier? I am studying basic quantum theory. My question is:Why can't a particle penetrate an infinite potential barrier?The reasoning that I have applied is that particles under consideration have finite energy. So, to cross an infinite potential barrier the particle requires infinite energy. But I cannot think of the mathematical relation between potential and energy so that indeed I am convinced that to cross an infinite potential barrier the particle needs infinite energy.What is the relation between the potential and energy of quantum mechanical particles?
