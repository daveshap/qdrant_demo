I've just failed my course because i'm lazy as shit
i've just failed my cert 4 in surveying and feel like shit. I constantly just ignored the problem and didn't re-submit assignments that i got wrong. My Mum paid for the course (~$3000) and all i've done is fuck it up by being lazy and complacent. Having wasted my last 6 months and my mums money i feel like a piece of shit. Now i'm doubting if i even want to do this as a job anymore (do have cert 3) and what the fuck im doing with my life. Now with Christmas just around the corner i'm going to have to explain to the majority of my family what i have just done. Happy Holidays
