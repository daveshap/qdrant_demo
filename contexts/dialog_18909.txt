PHIL: What's with the touching, why was he touching you?
ROSE: He wasn't touching me he was just...gesturing...
PHIL: He was caressing.
ROSE: Phil for God sake.
PHIL: God? No I didn't think you'd want to invoke God Rose, because he saw even more than I did. ROSE Look Phil, if you want the rights of a husband, you're gonna have to ask me something but if not, you're gonna have to get accustomed to the rights of what you are.
PHIL: Oh...what's that?
ROSE: Right now? An intimate border with...mechanical skills.
PHIL: Hi!
ROSE: Oh, Hi, how's the investigation going?
NICK: Just call us the &quot;dead end kids&quot;.
VADA: May I use the phone please.
ROSE: Oh, yeah, sure, help yourself.
PHIL: Anyone with taste, anyone with breeding.... A gentleman, would choose British racing green, with maybe a tan interior...but when you buy a red car, with a black interior and wire wheels, you have one thing on your mind and one thing only and I'm too much of a gentleman to say what that one thing is...in front of the children.
