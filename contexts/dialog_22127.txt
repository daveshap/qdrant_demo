MR. WHITE: Let's go over it. Where are you?
FREDDY: I stand outside and guard the door. I don't let anybody come in or go out.
MR. WHITE: Mr. Brown?
FREDDY: Mr. Brown stays in the car. He's parked across the street till I give him the signal, then he pulls up in front of the store.
MR. WHITE: Mr. Blonde and Mr. Blue?
FREDDY: Crowd control. They handle customers and employees in the display area.
MR. WHITE: Myself and Mr. Pink?
FREDDY: You two take the manager in the back and make him give you the diamonds. We're there for those stones, period. Since no display cases are being fucked with, no alarms should go off. We're out of there in two minutes, not one second longer. What if the manager won't give up the diamonds?
MR. WHITE: When you're dealing with a store like this, they're insured up the ass. They're not supposed to give you and resistance whatsoever. If you get a customer or an employee who thinks he's Charles Bronson, take the butt of your gun and smash their nose in. Drops 'em right to the floor. Everyone jumps, he falls down, screaming, blood squirts out his nose. Freaks everybody out. Nobody says fuckin' shit after that. You might get some bitch talk shit to ya. But give her a look, like you're gonna smash her in the face next. Watch her shut the fuck up. Now if it's a manager, that's a different story. The managers know better than to fuck around. So if one's givin' you static, he probably thinks he's a real cowboy. So what you gotta do is break that son-of-a-bitch in two. If you wanna know something and he won't tell you, cut off one of his fingers. The little one. Then you tell 'im his thumb's next. After that he'll tell ya if he wears ladies underwear. I'm hungry, let's get a taco.
