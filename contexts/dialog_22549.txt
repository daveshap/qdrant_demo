SALLY: How are we going to do all this?
BOOTH: I'm going to quit. That's what has to happen first. Then we're going to tell him.
SALLY: I don't know, Booth.
BOOTH: I'll be there for you. He won't try anything while I'm there. I promise. I'll protect you.
SALLY: When do you expect this inheritance stuff to be straightened out?
BOOTH: Shouldn't be long. A couple of weeks maybe.
SALLY: Can you rely on how much they said you'd get?
BOOTH: It'll be more than enough. We can get out of here...
