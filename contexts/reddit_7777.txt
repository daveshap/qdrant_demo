I literally have the best PI!
Past couple of days I’ve had to make some tough decisions. Finally made one but I was nervous that my PI won’t approve but he totally did! And he reassured me not to be nervous about it and he’s there to provide options and facilitate the process and not to judge or add pressure on us. Have been traumatized by my previous PI which always puts me on edge about certain things but now I feel so blessed !
