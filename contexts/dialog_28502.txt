MIMI: Where's Gilbert?
NICK: Gilbert! Is he here too? We might as well be living in the lobby.
GILBERT: There's a physiological as well as a psychological angle in my father's relationship with Julia Wolf that the police have overlooked. And I think it explains everything. You see, my father was a sexogenarian.
1ST REPORTER: He was?
GILBERT: Yes. He admitted it.
1ST REPORTER: Sexogerarian, eh? Yes. Yes. But I can't put that in the paper.
GILBERT: Why not?
1ST REPORTER: You know how they are... sex...
GILBERT: Then just say he was sixty years old.
1ST REPORTER: Is that what it means?
GILBERT: Of course.
