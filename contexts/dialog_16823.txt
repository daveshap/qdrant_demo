ROSE: ...No...I don't hate you. Do you want talk...do you really want to talk to me and say things and get things figured out, Jimmy?
JIMMY: Yeah.
ROSE: The question isn't wether or not you cheated on me, the question is how many times have you cheated on me?
JIMMY: Will that help?
ROSE: Yeah.
CLAUDIA: Did you ever go out with someone and just....lie....question after question, maybe you're trying to make yourself look cool or better than you are or whatever, or smarter or cooler and you just -- not really lie, but maybe you just don't say everything --
JIM KURRING: Well, that's a natural thing, two people go out on a date, something. They want to impress people, the other person...or they're scared maybe what they say will make the other person not like them --
CLAUDIA: So you've done it --
JIM KURRING: Well I don't go out very much.
CLAUDIA: Why not?
JIM KURRING: I've never found someone really that I think I would like to go out with.
CLAUDIA: And I bet you say that to all the girls --
JIM KURRING: No, no.
CLAUDIA: You wanna make a deal with me?
JIM KURRING: ok.
CLAUDIA: What I just said...y'know, people afraid to say things....no guts to say the things that they...that are real or something...
JIM KURRING: ...yeah...
CLAUDIA: To not do that. To not do that that we've maybe done -- before --
JIM KURRING: Let's make a deal.
CLAUDIA: Ok. I'll tell you everything and you tell me everything and maybe we can get through all the piss and shit and lies that kill other people....
JIM KURRING: Wow....huh......piss and shit...""
CLAUDIA: What?
JIM KURRING: You really use strong language.
CLAUDIA: I'm sorry --
JIM KURRING: -- no, no, it's fine. Fine.
CLAUDIA: I didn't mean...it's seems vulgar or something, I know --
JIM KURRING: It's fine.
CLAUDIA: I'm sorry.
JIM KURRING: ...nothing. I'm sorry...
CLAUDIA: No, I'm sorry. I'm saying I'm sorry. I talk like a jerk sometimes --
JIM KURRING: -- well I'm a real...y'know, straight when it comes to that...curse words I just don't use much --
CLAUDIA: I'm sorry.
CLAUDIA: I'm gonna run to the bathroom for a minute...maybe just --
JIM KURRING: ok.
CLAUDIA: ok.
