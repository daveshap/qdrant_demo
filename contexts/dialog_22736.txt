BECKY: You're a basket case.
ANNIE: They knew it. Time, distance, nothing could separate them. Because they knew. It was right. It was real. It was...
BECKY: ... movie. That's your problem. You don't want to be in love. You want to be in love in a movie. Read it to me.
ANNIE: Dear Sleepless and Son...""
BECKY: It sounds like the name of a mattress store --
ANNIE: I am not the sort of person who listens to call-in radio shows" --"
BECKY: And this woman is a writer! That's what everyone writes at the beginning of letters to strangers.
ANNIE: I know that. You think I don't know that? I know that's a dumb way to begin
BECKY: You are. You're losing your mind. What about Walter?
ANNIE: I'm going to marry Walter. I just have to get this out of my system.
BECKY: Right.
ANNIE: I should say something in this about magic.
BECKY: What?
ANNIE: I don't know. I mean, what if I never meet him? What if this man is my destiny and I never meet him?
BECKY: Your destiny can be your doom. Look at me and Rick.
ANNIE: I want to meet you...""
BECKY: On top of the Empire State Building at sunset on Valentine's Day.""
ANNIE: Good. Perfect. I'll be in New York with Walter, I can squeeze it in.
BECKY: You want to hear about destiny? If my husband hadn't gone on a diet, which caused me to leave him, I would never have been on that flight to Miami, and met Rick, and ended up having sex in the bathroom of a 727 with that nob you slide that says vacant-occupied
ANNIE: You never told me you left your husband because he went on a diet.
BECKY: He lost all the weight... there.
ANNIE: That's impossible. A guy can't --
BECKY: Can too.
ANNIE: No.
BECKY: Yes.
ANNIE: And then you left him? He lost weight there and you left him?
BECKY: Plus he fell in love with a temp.
ANNIE: Listen to this, I love this part --
BECKY: Men never get this movie.
ANNIE: I know.
BECKY: Do you think at the end of the movie when she's in the wheelchair they can still do it?
ANNIE: I always wondered about that too.
