Working on commission only making sales calls, how do I do this.
I recently was hired at a company and my job is to make sales calls from home to companies. This is kind of confusing for me since the company offered a training but not on how to sell, just on their product. They told us to just call places and sell, but one of my main questions is how do I do that? how do I know who to talk to when I'm just calling a businesses number and talking to a sales associate, I work on commission so this is a little hard for me since I make no hourly money. if anyone could give advice on how to sell to the proper person in a business or just advice in general that would be great. I'm trying to learn as I go on and today I got one person interested.
