SETH: You all are gonna fuckin' die! I'm gonna fuckin' kill every last one of you godless pieces of shit!
JACOB: You bet your sweet ass you are, and I'm gonna help you do it. But we ain't got much time.
KATE: You're gonna be okay, aren't you, daddy?
JACOB: No, I'm not. I've been bit. In effect, I'm already dead.
