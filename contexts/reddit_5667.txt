How to get a job overseas after a long-term unemployment in my own country?
First post here. I've been on a rut lately, but some background first:

I was a MBA graduate, with an undergraduate background in marketing. Because of some screwups (both my fault and office politics), I am currently unemployed for 4 years. I had a background in marketing research and advertising, but I did dabbled as a local freelance cinematographer/video editor (because that is my 2nd main passion and I loved it more than a corporate life, but it failed again).  I know the chances of me getting a full-time job is very slim, and right now it's adding towards my depression. 

To make matters worse, the situation in my own country is deteriorating, and I am planning to move abroad should my country's political situation gets even worse. Speaking of my country, the creative industry over there is so bad, uncreative or polarized towards a certain segment. I would love to work in the creative industry, specifically, the media industry. My first choice would be USA, followed by Australia/New Zealand, and maybe Germany or Spain.

Some questions:

1. What is the current creative/media industry atmosphere in Los Angeles/the rest of the States/Australia/New Zealand now?
2. How can I get a job if I am unemployed for 4 years? Would companies care?
3. How can I get a visa in the US or any other countries in this situation?
4. What are some of the best jobs for an entry-level person in the creative industry?
