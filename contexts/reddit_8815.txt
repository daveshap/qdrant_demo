What is the legal interpretation of the SCOTUS' refusal to grant cert to an appeal?
Recently there have been several cases (particularly regarding [LGBT discrimination](http://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/364243-supreme-court-refuses-to-hear-lgbt-workplace-discrimination-case) and [gun sale restrictions](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/courts_law/thomas-dissents-from-supreme-court-decision-not-to-review-california-gun-law/2018/02/20/342c378e-164d-11e8-92c9-376b4fe57ff7_story.html?utm_term=.58d1a546ac5e)) in which SCOTUS has refused to hear an appeal to an earlier ruling by a lower court. Obviously, a refusal of *certiorari* means that the previous ruling stands, but does it hold additional legal standing as a result of the refusal?
