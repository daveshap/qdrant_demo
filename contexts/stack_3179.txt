Did Palpatine have the ability to time travel? In Rebels final episode, \"Family Reunion - and Farewell\we could see that: <blockquote class=\"spoiler\">   Palpatine managed to create a time traveling portal and offered Ezra a one-way ticket to happy times with his family. All of this, even though the Lothal temple was destroyed in previous episodes. </blockquote>Was this just an illusion with Sith sorcery to break Ezra, or did Palpatine have the ability to time travel? I suppose he would not squander a one-time ride he could not repeat just to send Ezra away, instead of killing him on the spot.
