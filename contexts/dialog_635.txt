JOHN: Yeah, you know, O.K. Buster
FRANK: Oh, yes, now I'm with you. [he changes his accent] But, gee, Mister, I've got my license to think of ... we're doing a hundred now ...
JOHN: Ever seen one of these before?
FRANK: Ah ... a shamus, eh?
JOHN: I see you go to the night court.

NORM: Will you all stop it, you're like a gang of school kids. I knew this was going to happen one day.

FRANK: We're nearly there, sir.
JOHN: Eh ... don't call him sir, he's got enough delusions of power as it is.
