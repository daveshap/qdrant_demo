How Do I Explain Why I Was Fired in My Unemployment Interview? (URGENT)
So I was fired from my job recently in a way that was... kinda shitty. I worked at Target for just under two years, but last few months had been rough. Low hours, anxiety-induced stomach problems, car accident, weather making it impossible to get to work. I got fired two weeks ago and it was allegedly due to calling out too much.

But I hadn't called out in awhile and last I'd heard, I'd been doing better? 

My mother has just been hired at the same Target and both she and another employee at Target thought that maybe it was because of that rather than anything else, seeing as how there had been nothing huge that occurred between my last 'conversation' that officially had to do with any missed work and my termination.

I live in Kansas, which is an at-will state I think, so they can fire me for whatever. But because I was fired and there was, at least ostensibly, some prior work-related issues, I have to have an interview to decide whether or not I actually get unemployment.

How can I explain the circumstances in a way that isn't overtly salty/conspiratorial, but also doesn't make it impossible for me to get unemployment?
