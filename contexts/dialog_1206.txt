CHESS PLAYER: Here, Gladys, Tom. Did you hear the one about the crashing plane?
WOMAN: No, but we're about to.
CHESS PLAYER: You be quiet, woman, and let me speak.
WOMAN: Quiet, everyone! Hush! Shhh!
CHESS PLAYER: All right, laugh then. I shan't tell it.
WOMAN: Oh, come on, tell us.
CHESS PLAYER: No. You've had your chance.
JACK: Ask them what the candles are for.
DAVID: You ask them.
JACK: Listen, that's a pentangle, a five- pointed star. It's used in witchcraft. Lon Chaney, Jr. and Universal Studios maintain it's the mark of the wolf man.
DAVID: I see. You want me to ask these people if they're burning candles to ward off monsters.
JACK: Right.
DAVID: Wrong.
CHESS PLAYER: Oh, all right. There was this airplane over the Atlantic on its way to New York. It was full of men from the United Nations.
WOMAN: That's very funny, that is.
JACK: Go on, ask them.
DAVID: You ask them.
