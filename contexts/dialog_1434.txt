ZEE: Tennessee?
JESSE: I'll explain on the way.
JIMMY: Y'know, Uncle Frank...
FRANK: Yeah, Jimmy?
JIMMY: ...every time you tell that story, you stop there. That's not how it ended. I was five when my dad got shot.
FRANK: I know. But that's how it should have ended. Your Dad and Mom, riding off into a new life, growing old together, happy.
FRANK: Allow a man his version of the past. When you get to be my age, you've got enough painful memories, you're allowed to soften a few of the edges up.
JIMMY: Sounds like he was a hell of a man.
FRANK: That he was.
JIMMY: They're making him a hero now.
FRANK: Saved a lot of folk from the railroad.
JIMMY: But he killed a lot of men, too.
FRANK: Can't argue that.
JIMMY: So what was he?
FRANK: I think... he was just a real interestin' fella to have around.
