I miss her, but I really have no reason to.
Not using a throwaway so she might see this if she still looks at my posts. 

I really don't have a reason to miss you. What we had is long gone. I just can't get over the thought of you with someone else. I saw that god damn poem on the front page today with the guy who had OCD. It brought things back. I keep thinking of the things that drove us apart instead of the good things, but it's hard. I know with me moving home I won't see you again, probably ever. Living with that sucks. I really liked you. I hope you think of me as much as I think of you, but in the back of my mind I know you don't. I want to get a text from you in the middle of the night of you confessing how much you miss me, but you won't. You never even said good-bye. 

I just can't keep busy enough to stop thinking of her and let her go for good.
