A thank you for girls that start up a convo
I am a 20 year old guy who has been in a few relationships before not very long sadly. Might be a me problem too but it feels so mentally draining to always have to text first, think of what to talk about and keep a convo going. 

For a few weeks now I am texting/seeing this girl and it is honeslty a life changer. No pressure to start convos, she likes to talk about herself, she is a good listener, sends me stuff she finds funny. Even tho we are still at hugging phase I just wanted to tell guys like me: there is hope boys.

Jokes aside i guess there are others like this but it really makes you feel special. Weird how it took me 7 years to find this.
